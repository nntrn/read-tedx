"The Second Coming" by William Butler Yeats Turning and turning in the widening gyre The
falcon cannot hear the falconer; Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; Mere anarchy
is loosed upon the world, The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere The ceremony
of innocence is drowned; The best lack all conviction, while the worst Are full of
passionate intensity. Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at
hand. The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out When a vast image out of Spiritus
Mundi Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert A shape with lion body and the
head of a man, A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, Is moving its slow thighs, while
all about it Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. The darkness drops again; but
now I know That twenty centuries of stony sleep Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking
cradle, And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, Slouches towards Bethlehem
to be born?
