title: How I use art to bridge misunderstanding
speaker: Adong Judith
description: >-
 Director and playwright Adong Judith creates provocative art that sparks dialogue
 on issues from LGBTQ rights to war crimes. In this quick but powerful talk, the
 TED Fellow details her work -- including the play "Silent Voices," which brought
 victims of the Northern Ugandan war against Joseph Kony's rebel group together
 with political, religious and cultural leaders for transformative talks.
 "Listening to one another will not magically solve all problems," Judith says.
 "But it will give a chance to create avenues to start to work together to solve
 many of humanity's problems."

I'm a writer-director who tells social-change stories, because I believe stories touch and
move us. Stories humanize and teach us to empathize. Stories change us. When I write and
direct plays, I'm amplifying voices of disadvantaged groups, I'm fighting the
self-censorship that has kept many Ugandan artists away from social, political theater
since the persecution of artists by former Ugandan president, Idi Amin. And most
importantly, I am breaking the silence and provoking meaningful conversations on taboo
issues, where often "Silence is golden" is the rule of thumb. Conversations are important
because they inform and challenge our minds to think, and change starts with thinking. One
of my struggles with activism is its often one-sided nature that blinds us to alternative
view, that numbs our empathy, that makes us view those who see issues differently as
ignorant, self-hating, brainwashed, sellout or plain stupid. I believe no one is
ignorant.

We are all experts, only in different fields. And this is why, for me, the saying "stay in
your truth" is misleading. Because if you're staying in your truth, isn't it logical that
the person you believe is wrong is also staying in their truth? So, what you have is two
extremes that shut out all possible avenues of conversations. I create provocative theater
and film to touch, humanize and move disagreeing parties to the conversation table to
bridge misunderstandings. I know that listening to one another will not magically solve
all problems. But it will give a chance to create avenues to start to work together to
solve many of humanity's problems. With my first play, "Silent Voices," based on interviews
with victims of the Northern Uganda war between the government and Joseph Kony's LRA rebel
group, I brought together victims, political leaders, religious leaders, cultural leaders,
the Amnesty Commission and transitional justice leadership for critical conversations on
issues of justice for war crime victims â€” the first of its kind in the history of
Uganda.

And so many powerful things happened, that I can't even cover them all right now. Victims
were given the opportunity to sit at the table with Amnesty Commission leadership, and
they expressed the big injustice they suffered when the Commission ignored them and
instead facilitated the resettlement of the war perpetrators. And the Amnesty Commission
acknowledged the victims' pain and explained the thinking behind their flawed
approaches. But one of the things that has stayed with me is when, during my Northern
Uganda tour of the play, a man approached me and introduced himself as a former rebel
soldier of Joseph Kony. He told me that he didn't want me to leave feeling disappointed,
due to some of what I considered inappropriate laughter. He explained that his was a
laughter of embarrassment and a recognition of his own embarrassment. He saw himself in
the actors onstage and saw the meaninglessness of his past actions. So I say: share your
truths. Listen to one another's truths.

You will discover a more powerfully uniting truth in the middle ground. When I lived in the
USA, many of my American friends would be shocked at my ignorance at fancy Western dishes
like lasagna, for instance.

And my question to them would be, "Well, do you know malakwang?" And then I would tell
them about malakwang, a fancy vegetable dish from my culture. And they would tell me about
lasagna. And we would leave richer and fuller individuals. Therefore, share your recipe
truth. It makes for a better meal. Thank you.
