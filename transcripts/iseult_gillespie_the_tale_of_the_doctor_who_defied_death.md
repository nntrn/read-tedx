In their ramshackle hut on the edge of the woods, a husband and wife were in despair. The
woman had just given birth to their thirteenth child, and the growing family was quickly 
running out of food and money. The father walked into the woods to ponder their problem.
After hours spent wandering through the trees, he encountered two shadowy silhouettes.
The first figure appeared to be the man’s God, while the second resembled the Devil. Both
figures offered to lighten the man’s burden, and act as Godfather to his most recent
child. But the man refused their offer— he wouldn’t entrust his son to those who passed
judgment on human life. He ventured deeper into the tangled thicket. Here in the darkest
part of the woods, the father made out a third figure. Sunken eyes stared out of its
gaunt face, which broke into a crooked smile. This was Death himself, come to offer his
services as Godfather.

He promised to return when the child came of age, to bring him happiness and prosperity.
The father— knowing that all people are equal in the eyes of Death— accepted his
offer. Years later, when the child had grown into an ambitious young man, his skeletal
Godfather came for his promised visit. In his gnarled hand he held a flask containing
the cure for all human ailments. Death had brought this flask for his Godson, promising
to make him a successful doctor. But the powerful potion came with very strict rules. If
his Godson encountered a sick person and Death was hovering at the top of their bed, the
doctor could heal them with just a waft of the antidote’s fumes. But if Death lingered 
at the foot of the bed, he’d already claimed the patient as his own— and the doctor could
do nothing for them. In time, the doctor’s potent potion and uncanny instincts became
known throughout the land.

He grew rich and famous, casting off the hardships of his early life. When the king fell
ill, he summoned the famous physician to treat him. The doctor swept into the palace, 
ready to show off his skills. But when he entered the king’s chamber, he was dismayed to
see Death settled at the foot of the bed. The doctor desperately wanted the glory of
saving the king— even if it meant deceiving his Godfather. And so, he swiftly spun the bed
around and reversed Death’s position, leaving the doctor free to administer the
antidote. Death was livid. He warned his arrogant Godson that if he ever cheated Death
again, he would pay for it with his life. Death and the doctor continued their travels.
After some time, the king’s messengers came to collect the doctor yet again. The princess
was gravely ill, and the king had promised incredible riches to anyone who could cure
her. The doctor approached the princesses’ chamber with gold in his eyes.

But upon seeing the sleeping princess, his greed fell away. He was so struck by her
grace, that he failed to notice Death lurking by her feet. He swiftly healed the
princess, but before she could even utter her thanks, Death had dragged his lovesick
Godson away. In an instant, the palace dissolved around them. The doctor found himself in
an immense cave lined with countless quivering candles, each representing the duration of
a life. As punishment for his Godson’s foolish attempt to master mortality, Death
whittled his candle down to its wick. Seeing his own dwindling light, the doctor felt the
fear he’d often glimpsed in his patients’ eyes. Desperately, he begged Death to transfer 
his dying light onto a new candle. His Godfather considered the request— but the doctor’s
betrayal was too great. He loosened his bony grip, and his Godson’s candle fell to the
floor. Death stood motionless, his inscrutable face fixed on the sputtering flame— until
all that was left of the doctor was a wisp of smoke.
