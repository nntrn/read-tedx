title: 3 questions we should ask about nuclear weapons
speaker: Emma Belcher
description: >-
 There are more than 10,000 nuclear weapons in existence today, each one capable
 of causing immense destruction. Why don't we talk about this threat as much as
 some other major issues? In this practical talk, nuclear security expert Emma
 Belcher shares three questions you can ask your elected officials to gain a
 better understanding of nuclear weapons and the measures we need to stay
 safe.

So you know when you're doubled over in pain and you're wondering, is it your appendix or
maybe you ate something funny? Well, when that happens to me, I call my friend Sasha —
Sasha is a doctor — and I say, "Should I rush to the nearest emergency room in a panic? Or
am I OK to relax and just wait it out?" Yes, I am that annoying friend. But in September
2017, friends of mine were suddenly calling me for my professional opinion. And no, I'm
not a doctor, but they were asking me questions of life and death. So what was going on in
September of 2017? Well, North Korea was suddenly and scarily all over the news. Kim
Jong-un had tested missiles potentially capable of hitting major US cities, and President
Trump had responded with tweets of "fire and fury." And there was real concern that
tensions would escalate to a potential war or even nuclear weapons use. So what my friends
were calling and asking was: Should they panic or were the OK to relax?

But really, they were asking me a fundamental question: "Am I safe?"While I was reassuring
them that, no, they didn't need to worry just yet, the irony of their question dawned on
me. What they hadn't really thought about is that we've all been living under a much
larger cloud for decades — potentially a mushroom cloud — without giving it much
thought. Now it's not surprising that friends of mine and many others like them don't know
much about nuclear weapons and don't think about them. After all, the end of the Cold War,
the United States and Russia, tension abated, we started dismantling nuclear weapons, and
they started to become a relic of the past. Generations didn't have to grow up with the
specter of nuclear war hanging over their heads. And there other reasons people don't like
to think about nuclear weapons. It's scary, overwhelming. I get it. Sometimes I wish I
could have chosen a cheerier field to study.

Perhaps tax law would have been more uplifting.

But in addition to that, people have so many other things to think about in their busy
lives, and they'd much prefer to think about something over which they feel they have some
semblance of control, and they assume that other people, smarter than they on this topic,
are working away to keep us all safe. And then, there are other reasons people don't talk
about this, and one is because we, as nuclear experts, use a whole lot of convoluted
jargon and terminology to talk about these issues: CVID, ICBM, JCPOA. It's really
inaccessible for a lot of people. And, in reality, it actually sometimes I think makes us
numb to what we're really talking about here. And what we are really talking about here is
the fact that, while we've made dramatic reductions in the number of nuclear weapons since
the Cold War, right now, there are almost 15,000 in the world today. 15,000. The United
States and Russia have over 90 percent of these nuclear weapons.

If you're wondering, these are the countries that have the rest. But they have far fewer,
ranging in the sort of 300-ish range and below. Adding to this situation is the fact that
we have new technologies that potentially bring us new challenges. Could you imagine, one
day, countries like ours and others potentially ceding decisions about a nuclear strike to
a robot, based on algorithms? And what data do they use to inform those algorithms? This
is pretty terrifying. So adding to this are terrorism potential, cyberattacks,
miscalculation, misunderstanding. The list of nuclear nightmares tends to grow longer by
the day. And there are a number of former officials, as well as experts, who worry that
right now, we're in greater danger than we were in various points in the Cold War. So this
is scary. What can we do? Well, thankfully, ["Duck and Cover"] we don't have to rely on
the advice from the 1950s.

We can take some control, and the way we do that is by starting to ask some fundamental
questions about the status quo and whether we are happy with the way it is. We need to
begin asking questions of ourselves and of our elected officials, and I'd like to share
three with you today. The first one is, "How much nuclear risk are you willing to take or
tolerate?" Right now, nuclear policy depends on deterrence theory. Developed in the 1950s,
the idea is that one country's nuclear weapons prevents another country from using theirs.
So you nuke me, I nuke you, and we both lose. So in a way, there's a stalemate. No one
uses their weapons, and we're all safe. But this theory has real questions. There are
experts who challenge this theory and wonder: Does it really work this way in practice? It
certainly doesn't allow for mistakes or miscalculations. Now, I don't know about you, but
I feel pretty uncomfortable gambling my future survival, yours, and our future
generations', on a theory that is questionable and doesn't allow any room for a
mistake.

It makes me even more uncomfortable to be threatening the evaporation of millions of
people on the other side of the Earth. Surely we can do better for ourselves, drawing on
our ingenuity to solve complex problems, as we have in the past. After all, this is a
man-made, human-made — I shouldn't say "man," because women were involved — a human-made
problem. We have human solutions that should be possible. So, next question: "Who do you
think should make nuclear decisions?" Right now, in this democracy, in the United States,
one person gets to decide whether or not to launch a nuclear strike. They don't have to
consult anybody. So that's the president. He or she can decide — within a very limited
amount of time, under great pressure, potentially, depending on the scenario, maybe based
on a miscalculation or a misunderstanding — they can decide the fate of millions of lives:
yours, mine, our community's.

And they can do this and launch a nuclear strike, potentially setting in motion the
annihilation of the human race. Wow. This doesn't have to be our reality, though, and in
fact, in a number of other countries that have nuclear weapons, it's not, including
countries that are not democracies. We created this system. We can change it. And there's
actually a movement underway to do so. So this leads me to my third question: "What do your
elected officials know about nuclear weapons, and what types of decisions are they likely
to take on your behalf?" Well, Congress has a very important role to play in oversight of
and interrogating US nuclear weapons policy. They can decide what to fund, what not to
fund, and they represent you. Now unfortunately, since the end of the Cold War, we've seen
a real decline in the level of understanding, on Capitol Hill, about these issues. While
we are starting to see some terrific new champions emerge, the reality is that the general
lack of awareness is highly concerning, given that these people need to make critically
important decisions.

To make matters worse, the political partisanship that currently grips Washington also
affects this issue. This wasn't always the case, though. At the end of the Cold War,
members from both sides of the aisle had a really good understanding about the nuclear
challenges we were facing and worked together on cooperative programs. They recognized
that nuclear risk reduction was far too important to allow it to succumb to political
partisanship. They created programs such as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction
Program, which sought to lock down and eliminate vulnerable nuclear material in the former
Soviet Union. So we need to return to this era of bipartisanship, mutual problem-solving
that's based on understanding and awareness about the challenges we face and the real
nuclear dangers. And that's where you come in. Public pressure is important. Leaders need a
constituent base to act. So create that constituent base, by asking them some simple
questions.

Ask them, "What do you know about nuclear weapons?" "Do you have a nuclear expert on your
staff? Or, if not, do you know somebody you could refer to if you need to make an
important decision?" Start to find out what they believe and whether it aligns with your
own views and values. Ask them, "How would you choose to spend US national treasure? On a
new nuclear arms race or another national security priority, such as cybersecurity or
climate change?" Ask them, "Are you willing to put aside partisanship to address this
existential threat that affects my survival and your constituents' survival?"Now, people
will tell you nuclear policy is far too difficult to understand and complexed and nuanced
for the general public to understand, let alone debate. After all, this is "national
security." There needs to be secrets. Don't let that put you off. We debate all sorts of
issues that are critically important to our lives — why should nuclear weapons be any
different?

We debate health care, education, the environment. Surely congressional oversight, civic
participation that are such hallmarks of US democracy, surely they apply here. After all,
these are cases of life and death that we're talking about. And we won't all agree, but
whether or not you believe nuclear weapons keep us safe or that nuclear weapons are a
liability, I urge you to put aside partisan, ideological issues and listen to each
other. So I'll tell you now what I didn't have the guts to tell my friends at the time. No,
you're not safe — not just because of North Korea. But there is something you can do about
it. Demand that your elected representatives can give you answers to your questions, and
answers that you can live with and that billions of others can live with too. And if they
can't, stay on them until they can. And if that doesn't work, find others, who are able to
represent your views.

Because by doing so, we can begin to change the answer to the question "Am I
safe?"
