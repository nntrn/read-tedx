One of the most remarkable aspects of the human brain is its ability to recognize patterns
and describe them. Among the hardest patterns we've tried to understand is the concept of
turbulent flow in fluid dynamics. The German physicist Werner Heisenberg said, "When I
meet God, I'm going to ask him two questions: why relativity and why turbulence? I really
believe he will have an answer for the first."As difficult as turbulence is to understand
mathematically, we can use art to depict the way it looks. In June 1889, Vincent van Gogh
painted the view just before sunrise from the window of his room at the
Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, where he'd admitted himself after
mutilating his own ear in a psychotic episode. In "The Starry Night," his circular
brushstrokes create a night sky filled with swirling clouds and eddies of stars. Van Gogh
and other Impressionists represented light in a different way than their predecessors,
seeming to capture its motion, for instance, across sun-dappled waters, or here in star
light that twinkles and melts through milky waves of blue night sky.

The effect is caused by luminance, the intensity of the light in the colors on the canvas.
The more primitive part of our visual cortex, which sees light contrast and motion, but
not color, will blend two differently colored areas together if they have the same
luminance. But our brains' primate subdivision will see the contrasting colors without
blending. With these two interpretations happening at once, the light in many
Impressionist works seems to pulse, flicker and radiate oddly. That's how this and other
Impressionist works use quickly executed prominent brushstrokes to capture something
strikingly real about how light moves. Sixty years later, Russian mathematician Andrey
Kolmogorov furthered our mathematical understanding of turbulence when he proposed that
energy in a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to the 5/3rds power of R.
Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close to the way turbulent flow
works, although a complete description of turbulence remains one of the unsolved problems
in physics.

A turbulent flow is self-similar if there is an energy cascade. In other words, big eddies
transfer their energy to smaller eddies, which do likewise at other scales. Examples of
this include Jupiter's Great Red Spot, cloud formations and interstellar dust particles. In
2004, using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists saw the eddies of a distant cloud of
dust and gas around a star, and it reminded them of Van Gogh's "Starry Night." This
motivated scientists from Mexico, Spain and England to study the luminance in Van Gogh's
paintings in detail. They discovered that there is a distinct pattern of turbulent fluid
structures close to Kolmogorov's equation hidden in many of Van Gogh's paintings. The
researchers digitized the paintings, and measured how brightness varies between any two
pixels. From the curves measured for pixel separations, they concluded that paintings from
Van Gogh's period of psychotic agitation behave remarkably similar to fluid
turbulence.

His self-portrait with a pipe, from a calmer period in Van Gogh's life, showed no sign of
this correspondence. And neither did other artists' work that seemed equally turbulent at
first glance, like Munch's "The Scream."While it's too easy to say Van Gogh's turbulent
genius enabled him to depict turbulence, it's also far too difficult to accurately express
the rousing beauty of the fact that in a period of intense suffering, Van Gogh was somehow
able to perceive and represent one of the most supremely difficult concepts nature has
ever brought before mankind, and to unite his unique mind's eye with the deepest mysteries
of movement, fluid and light.
