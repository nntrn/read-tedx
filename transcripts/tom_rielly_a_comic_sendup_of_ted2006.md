I just want to say, over the last few years I've been — had the opportunity to do this
closing conference. And I've had some incredible warm-up acts. About eight years ago,
Billy Graham opened for me. And I thought that there was —

I thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that. But I just wanted to say —
and I mean this without irony — I think I can speak for everybody in the audience when I
say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States.

OK, this is the title of my talk today.

I just want to give you a quick overview. First of all, please remember I'm completely
politically correct, and I mean everything with great affection. If any of you have
sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy, now is the time to check your
Blackberry.

Just to review, this is my TEDTalk. We're going to do some jokes, some gags, some little
skits — and then we're going to talk about the L1 point.

So, one of the questions I ask myself is, was this the most distressing TED ever? Let's
try and sum things up, shall we? Images of limb regeneration and faces filled with
smallpox: 21 percent of the conference.

Mentions of polar bears drowning: four percent. Images of the earth being wiped out by
flood or bird flu: 64 percent.

And David Pogue singing show tunes.

Because this is the most distressing TED ever, I've been working with Neil Gershenfeld on
next year's TED Bag. And if the — if the conference is anywhere near this distressing,
then we're going to have a scream bag next year.

It's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag, of course.

So you're going to be able to go like this.

Bring it over here and open it up. Aaaah!

Meanwhile, back at TED University, this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop Sun
Chips.

So Robert Wright — I don't know,I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give
antidepressants to, it might have been him. I want to deliberately interfere with his
dopamine levels.

He was talking about morality. Economy class morality is, we want to bomb you back to the
Stone Age. Business class morality is, don't bomb Japan — they built my car. And
first-class morality is, don't bomb Mexico — they clean my house.

Yes, it is politically incorrect. All right, now I want to do a little bit of a thing for
you ...

All right, now these are the wha — I'd say, [mumble, mumble — mumble, mumble, mumble,
mumble, mumble] — ahh!

So I wanted to show you guys — I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer
interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you — as a completely natural
user interface.

And you can — you can use really natural hand gestures to like, go like
this.

Now we had a Harvard professor here — she was from Harvard, I just wanted to mention and —
and she was actually a professor from Harvard. And she was talking about
seven-dimensional, inverted universes. With, you know, of course, there's the gravity
brain. There's the weak brain. And then there's my weak brain, which is too — too —
absolutely too weak to understand what the fuck she was talking about.

Now —

one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on Earth am I
here for. And that's why I went out and I picked up a best-selling business book. You
know, it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology. And it's by a guy named
Pastor Rick Warren, and it's called "The Porpoise Driven Life."

And Rick is as a pagan god, which I thought was kind of appropriate, in a certain way. And
now we're going to have kind of a little more visualization about Rick Warren.
OK.

All right. Now, red is Rick Warren, and green is Daniel Dennett, OK?

The scales here are religiosity from zero percent, or atheist, to 100 percent, Bible
literally true. And then this is books sold — the logarithmic scale.

30,000, 300,000, three million, 30 million, 300 million. OK, now they're duking it out.
Now they're duking it out.

And Rick Warren's kind of pulling ahead, kind of pulling ahead. Yup, and his installed
base is getting a little bigger.

But Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back. Let me turn the trails on,
so you can see that a little bit better.

Now, one of the things that's very important is, Nicholas Negroponte talked to us about
one lap dance per — I'm sorry —

about One Laptop Per Child. Now let's talk about some of the characteristics that are
important for this revolutionary device. I'll tell you a little bit about the design
parameters, and then I'll show it to you in person. First of all, it needs to be small. It
needs to be flat, so it's transportable. Lightweight. Portable. Uses very, very little
power. Very, very high resolution. Has to be visible in bright daylight. Will work
anywhere. And broadly applicable across many platforms. Now, we've actually done some
research — Neil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market. They did some
research; we came back; and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in
the field are actually asking for. And here it is, the $100 computer.

OK, OK, OK, OK — excellent, excellent. Now, I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for
about 900 bucks. And he and his team of junior-high school students were doing real
science. So we're trying to check and trying to douse here, and see who uses
marijuana.

See who uses marijuana. Are we going to be able to find any marijuana, Jim Young? Only if
we open enough locker doors.

OK, now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness. We had Dr. Larry Brilliant talking
about how we eradicated smallpox. I wanted to show you the stages of smallpox. We start.
This is day one.

Day two. Day three, she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder. Day three. Day
four.

Day five and day six.

Now the good news is, because I'm a trained medical professional, I know that even though
she'll be scarred for life, she's going to make a full recovery.

Now the good news about Architects for Humanity is they're really kind of the most amazing
group. They've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical
housing solutions, clinic solutions, in Africa, and they've had a design competition. Now
the wonderful thing is, Larry Brilliant was just appointed the head of the Google
Foundation, and so he decided that he would support — he would support Cameron's work. And
the way he decided to support that work was by shipping over 50,000 shipping containers of
Google snacks.

So I want to show you some prototypes. The U.N. — you know, they took 20 years just to add
a flap to a tent, but I think we have some more exciting things. This is a home made
entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups.

And those roll-up cookies coated with white chocolate. And the really wonderful thing
about this is, when you're done, well — you can eat it. But the thing that I'm really,
really excited about is this incredible granola house.

And the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof to collect water and recycle it. And
it's — well, on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids and Gummy Bears to let in the
light.

But on this side, it has sugary Gummy Bears, to diffuse the light more slightly. And we —
we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ.

So, Einstein — Einstein, tell me — what's your favorite song? No, I said what's your
favorite song? No, I said what's your favorite song? "Free Bird."

OK, so, Einstein, what's your favorite singing group? Could you say that again? What's
your favorite singing group? OK, one more time — I'm just going to give you a little help.
Your favorite singing group — it's Diana Ross and the —Audience: Supremes!Tom Reilly:
Exactly.

Could we have the sound up on the laptop, please?

"Free Bird" kind of reminds me that if you — if you listen to "Free Bird" backwards, this
is what you might hear. Computer: Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan. TR: Now
it's a little hard to hear the whole message, so I wanted to —

so I wanted to help you a little bit. Computer: My sweet Satan. Dan Dennett worships Satan.
Buy "The Purpose-Driven Life," or Satan will take your soul.

TR: So, we've talked a lot about global warming, but, you know, as Jill said, it sounds
kind of nice — good weather in the wintertime, and New York City. And as Jay Walker
pointed out, that is just not scary enough. So Al, I actually think I'm rather good at
branding. So I've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to
replace "global warming."So we started with Babel Fish. We put in global warming. And then
we decided that we'd change it from English to Dutch — into "Het globale Verwarmen." From
Dutch to [Korean], into "Hordahordaneecheewa."

[Korean] to Portuguese: Aquecer-se Global. Then Portuguese to Pig Latin.

Aquecer-se ucked-fay. And then finally back into the English, which is, we're totally
fucked.

Now I don't know about you, but Michael Shermer talked about the willingness for human
beings — evolutionarily, they're designed to see patterns in things. For example, in
cheese sandwiches. Now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary?
I tried to make it a little bit clearer.

Is it the Virgin Mary? Or is it Mena Trott? So, I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the
convention center and the conferences. It's getting awfully big. It's getting just a
little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit. So we tried to come up
with a program — how we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED. So first of
all we decided —

that we needed about one-third bookstore, one-third Google cafe, about 20 percent
registration, 80 percent luxury hotel, about five percent for restrooms. And then of
course, we wanted to have the simulcast lounge, the lobby and the Steinbeck forum. Now let
me show you how that literally translated into the design program. So first, one of the
problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming and Greenland melts as you say,
the ocean level is going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center.
So we're going to build this new building on stilts. So we build this building on stilts,
then up here —

is where we're going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium.

And the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is, it's going to be shaped in a spiral
that's organized by the Dewey Decimal System.

Then we're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there. And finally, we're
going to put the Marriott Hotel and the Portola Plaza on the top.

Now I don't know about you, but sometimes I have these images in my head of separated at
birth. I don't know about you, but when I see Aubrey de Grey, I immediately go to Gandalf
the Grey.

OK. Now, we've heard, of course, that we're all soldiers here. So what I'd really, really
like you to do now is, pick up your white piece of paper. Does everybody have their white
piece of paper? And I want you to get out a pen, and I want you to write a terrorist
note.

If we put up the ELMO for a moment — if we put up the ELMO, then we'll get, you know, I'll
give you a model that you can work from, OK?

And then I want you to fold that note into a paper airplane. And once you've folded it
into a paper airplane, I want you to take some anthrax —

and I want you to put that in the paper airplane. And then I want you to throw it on Jim
Young.

Luckily, I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year. And I wanted to see — I want to
dedicate this film to my father, Homer. OK.Now this film isn't really hard enough, so I
wanted to make it a little bit harder. So I'm going to try and do this while reciting
pi.

3.1415, 2657, 753, 8567, 24972 — — 85871, 25871, 3928, 5657, 2592, 5624.

Can we cue the music please?

Now I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit. Back in 1968, you
can see that the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain was covered in 151 inches of snow
pack. Parenthetically, over there on the slopes, I did want to show you that black men
ski.

But over the years, 10 years later, the snow packs eroded, and, if you notice, the trees
have started turning yellow. The water level of the lake has started drying up. A few
years later, there's no snow left at all. And all the trees have turned brown. This year,
unfortunately the lakebed's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed. And I fear, if we do
nothing for our planet, in 20 years, it's going to look like this.

Mr. Vice President, I wish I knew how to quit you.

Thank you very much.
