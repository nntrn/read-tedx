title: Light waves, visible and invisible
speaker: Lucianne Walkowicz
description: >-
 Each kind of light has a unique wavelength, but human eyes can only perceive a
 tiny slice of the full spectrum -- the very narrow range from red to violet.
 Microwaves, radio waves, x-rays and more are hiding, invisible, just beyond our
 perception. Lucianne Walkowicz shows us the waves we can't see. [Directed by
 Pew36 Animation Studios, narrated by Lucianne Walkowicz].

What if you could only see one color? Imagine, for instance, that you could only see
things that were red and that everything else was completely invisible to you. As it turns
out, that's how you live your life all the time because your eyes can only see a minuscule
part of the full spectrum of light. Different kinds of light are all around you everyday
but are invisible to the human eye, from the radio waves that carry your favorite songs,
to the x-rays doctors use to see inside of you, to the microwaves that heat up your food.
In order to understand how these can all be light, we'll need to know a thing or two about
what light is. Light is electromagnetic radiation that acts like both a wave and a
particle. Light waves are kind of like waves on the ocean. There are big waves and small
waves, waves that crash on the shore one right after the other, and waves that only roll
in every so often. The size of a wave is called its wavelength, and how often it comes by
is called its frequency.

Imagine being a boat in that ocean, bobbing up and down as the waves go by. If the waves
that day have long wavelengths, they'll make you bob only so often, or at a low frequency.
If the waves, instead, have short wavelengths, they'll be close together, and you'll bob
up and down much more often, at a high frequency. Different kinds of light are all waves,
they just have different wavelengths and frequencies. If you know the wavelength or
frequency of a wave of light, you can also figure out its energy. Long wavelengths have
low energies, while short wavelengths have high energies. It's easy to remember if you
think about being in that boat. If you were out sailing on a day with short, choppy waves,
you'd probably be pretty high energy yourself, running around to keep things from falling
over. But on a long wavelength sea, you'd be rolling along, relaxed, low energy. The
energy of light tells us how it will interact with matter, for example, the cells of our
eyes.

When we see, it's because the energy of light stimulates a receptor in our eye called the
retina. Our retina are only sensitive to light with a very small range in energy, and so
we call that range of light visible light. Inside our retina are special receptors called
rods and cones. The rods measure brightness, so we know how much light there is. The cones
are in charge of what color of light we see because different cones are sensitive to
different energies of light. Some cones are more excited by light that is long wavelength
and low energy, and other cones are more excited by short wavelength, high-energy light.
When light hits our eye, the relative amount of energy each cone measures signals our
brain to perceive colors. The rainbow we perceive is actually visible light in order of
its energy. At one side of the rainbow is low-energy light we see as red, and at the other
side is high-energy light we see as blue.

If light shines on us that has an energy our retina can't measure, we won't be able to see
it. Light that is too short wavelength or high energy gets absorbed by the eye's surface
before it can even get to the retina, and light that is too long wavelength doesn't have
enough energy to stimulate our retina at all. The only thing that makes one kind of light
different from another is its wavelength. Radio waves have long wavelengths, while x-rays
have short wavelengths. And visible light, the kind you can actually see, is somewhere in
between. Even though our eyes can't detect light outside of the visible range, we can
build special detectors that are stimulated by these other wavelengths of light, kind of
like digital eyes. With these devices, we can measure the light that is there, even though
we can't see it ourselves. So, take a step back and think about all of this for a moment.
Even though they seem different, the warmth you feel from a crackling fire is the same as
the sun shining on you on a beautiful day, the same as ultraviolet light you put on
sunscreen to protect yourself from, the same thing as your TV, your radio, and your
microwave.

Now, those examples are all things here on Earth, things you experience in your everyday
life, but here's something even more amazing. Our universe gives off the full spectrum of
light, too. When you think of the night sky, you probably think of being able to see the
stars shining with your own eyes, but that's just visible light, which you now know is
only a tiny part of the full spectrum. If we had to draw the universe and could only use
visible light, it would be like having only one crayon â€” pretty sad. To see the universe
in its full spectrum, we need to have the right eyes, and that means using special
telescopes that can help us see beyond visible light. You've probably heard of the Hubble
Space Telescope and seen its beautiful pictures taken in visible and ultraviolet light.
But you might not know that there are 20 space telescopes in orbit, missions that can each
see part of the full spectrum of light.

With telescopes acting as our virtual eyes, both in space and here on Earth, we can see
some amazing things. And the coolest thing of all, no matter the wavelength or energy, the
light that we see out in the distant universe is the same thing as the light that we can
experience and study here on Earth. So, since we know the physics of how x-ray,
ultraviolet light, or microwaves work here, we can study the light of a distant star or
galaxy and know what kinds of things are happening there too. So, as you go about your
daily life, think beyond what your eyes can and can't see. Knowing just a little bit about
the natural world can help you perceive the full spectrum around you all the
time.
