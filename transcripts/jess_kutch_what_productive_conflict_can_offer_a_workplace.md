I am a labor organizer, and in 2013, I cofounded an organization called coworker.org that
uses technology to help people join with coworkers and organize for improvements in the
workplace. Now, there are two kinds of reactions to what I do. Actually, no, there are
three. The first is complete confusion about what organizing is. When my doctor asked what
I do and I told him, he thought I meant organizing, like, Marie Kondo-style.

He was like, "Oh, that's so great, I could use some of that around here. I would love to
clean up our patient files." And I had to explain to him that no, no, it's not that kind
of organizing, it's more like if you showed up to work tomorrow and all the nurses in the
office had gotten together to ask for an across-the-board raise.

"Oh," he replied, and he got really quiet.

Yeah, and that's the second kind of reaction: the uncomfortable kind. People usually
withdraw from the conversation and find someone else to talk to. Finally, there's the third
reaction, the excited one, the, "Oh my God, yes! We need this!" And someone always
proceeds to tell me a story. It's always a story about a job or a coworker or a friend
who's enduring something awful at work. What I've noticed is that there is never a neutral
response to what I do. You're either repelled by it, or you're struck with a lightning
bolt of excitement. So why does my work stir up such strong reactions? My hunch is that
it's about conflict. If you have power in your workplace, maybe as a CEO or a senior
leader of some kind, you're going to feel uncomfortable with that power being challenged.
But if you lack power, or you know someone who lacks it and needs it, you might grab me by
the shoulders and shake me, you're so pumped.

But really, we can all benefit from understanding what conflict can offer in our
workplaces. The power imbalance in our workplace is real, and it's constantly changing.
Power moves between us, depending on our roles and status. Now, sometimes this can feel
like office politics, right? Which is never fun. But when we contest for power
thoughtfully and together with our coworkers, it can be incredibly productive. And it's
that kind of productive conflict that I want to talk to you all about today, the kind that
can make some of us uncomfortable. Business leaders should embrace when their workers
conflict with policies and decisions, both for what it teaches us and for what it says
about our commitment to each other. So what do I mean by "productive conflict"? Well, let
me tell you a story. In 2016, a store employee for an outdoor retailer — I'll call her
"Alex" — Alex approached her boss and asked for a raise.

Now, she was told her pay was fairly standard for her position and that her boss didn't
even have the authority to give such a raise. And that was supposed to be the end of the
conversation. Unhappy with that answer, Alex went home, and she decided to create a
campaign on coworker.org, asking the corporate office to give raises to store employees.
Within days, employees from around the country began joining Alex's effort and sharing
their own stories about what they were earning — 11, 12 dollars an hour — and how that
wage was impacting their lives. Some even shared that they had quit recently to work for
competitors who paid more. But here's the thing: they also shared that they didn't want to
quit, they liked their job, they believed in the company's mission, but for them, the pay
issue was a growing problem in their work lives. Well, after weeks of this groundswell of
employee activism, the company decided to raise wages by five to 15 percent in cities
across the country.

And that's what I mean by productive conflict: pushing up against the things that aren't
working for us when there exists no other path forward. The other thing I learned in doing
this work is that people engage in productive conflict when they care about their jobs and
their coworkers. Now, that surprised me at first. I expected the worst jobs, the worst
workplaces, to have the most employee activism on our site, but the opposite is often
true. When we come together, we can accomplish great things. At one company, there are more
than 50 campaigns by employees there on issues ranging from dress code changes to
legitimate safety concerns. And get this: that same company has the lowest voluntary
turnover rate of any major chain in its sector. And it also has one of the higher
productivity rates as well. Business leaders: you shouldn't fear conflict, and you
shouldn't try to tamp down on it the minute it bubbles up in your workforce.

While it can introduce uncertainties that can be difficult to manage, those uncertainties
are trying to tell you something about an underlying problem that needs your attention.
And I think this is especially important right now, you know, as technology transforms
nearly everyone's job and as the structures that contain our work are changing at a pace
not seen since the Industrial Revolution. We all need to be shaping and participating in
the future of work. We all need to be challenging and changing the parts of our work lives
that are broken. So I hope the next time a coworker invites you maybe to join a sign-on
letter to your boss, or a group of employees asks for a meeting to discuss their concerns
about the new health care plan, I hope you'll consider it an opportunity to build a better
workplace, a stronger business and an economy that works for all of us. Thank
you.
