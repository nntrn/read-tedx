title: The uncertain location of electrons
speaker: George Zaidan and Charles Morton
description: >-
 The tiny atoms that make up our world are made up of even tinier protons,
 neutrons and electrons. Though the number of protons determines an atom's
 identity, it's the electrons -- specifically, their exact location outside the
 nucleus -- that particularly perplex scientists. George Zaidan and Charles Morton
 show how to make an educated guess of where those itty-bitty freewheeling
 electrons might be. [Directed by Karrot Animation, narrated by George Zaidan].

You probably know that all stuff is made up of atoms and that an atom is a really, really,
really, really tiny particle. Every atom has a core, which is made up of at least one
positively charged particle called a proton, and in most cases, some number of neutral
particles called neutrons. That core is surrounded by negatively charged particles called
electrons. The identity of an atom is determined only by the number of protons in its
nucleus. Hydrogen is hydrogen because it has just one proton, carbon is carbon because it
has six, gold is gold because it has 79, and so on. Indulge me in a momentary tangent. How
do we know about atomic structure? We can't see protons, neutrons, or electrons. So, we do
a bunch of experiments and develop a model for what we think is there. Then we do some
more experiments and see if they agree with the model. If they do, great. If they don't,
it might be time for a new model.

We've had lots of very different models for atoms since Democritus in 400 BC, and there
will almost certainly be many more to come. Okay, tangent over. The cores of atoms tend to
stick together, but electrons are free to move, and this is why chemists love electrons.
If we could marry them, we probably would. But electrons are weird. They appear to behave
either as particles, like little baseballs, or as waves, like water waves, depending on
the experiment that we perform. One of the weirdest things about electrons is that we
can't exactly say where they are. It's not that we don't have the equipment, it's that
this uncertainty is part of our model of the electron. So, we can't pinpoint them, fine.
But we can say there's a certain probability of finding an electron in a given space
around the nucleus. And that means that we can ask the following question: If we drew a
shape around the nucleus such that we would be 95% sure of finding a given electron within
that shape, what would it look like?

Here are a few of these shapes. Chemists call them orbitals, and what each one looks like
depends on, among other things, how much energy it has. The more energy an orbital has,
the farther most of its density is from the nucleus. By they way, why did we pick 95% and
not 100%? Well, that's another quirk of our model of the electron. Past a certain distance
from the nucleus, the probability of finding an electron starts to decrease more or less
exponentially, which means that while it will approach zero, it'll never actually hit
zero. So, in every atom, there is some small, but non-zero, probability that for a very,
very short period of time, one of its electrons is at the other end of the known universe.
But mostly electrons stay close to their nucleus as clouds of negative charged density
that shift and move with time. How electrons from one atom interact with electrons from
another determines almost everything.

Atoms can give up their electrons, surrendering them to other atoms, or they can share
electrons. And the dynamics of this social network are what make chemistry interesting.
From plain old rocks to the beautiful complexity of life, the nature of everything we see,
hear, smell, taste, touch, and even feel is determined at the atomic level.
