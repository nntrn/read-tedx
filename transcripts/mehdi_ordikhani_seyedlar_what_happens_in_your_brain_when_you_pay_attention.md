title: What happens in your brain when you pay attention?

 Attention isn't just about what we focus on -- it's also about what our brains
 filter out. By investigating patterns in the brain as people try to focus,
 computational neuroscientist Mehdi Ordikhani-Seyedlar hopes to build computer
 models that can be used to treat ADHD and help those who have lost the ability to
 communicate. Hear more about this exciting science in this brief, fascinating
 talk.

Paying close attention to something: Not that easy, is it? It's because our attention is
pulled in so many different directions at a time, and it's in fact pretty impressive if
you can stay focused. Many people think that attention is all about what we are focusing
on, but it's also about what information our brain is trying to filter out. There are two
ways you direct your attention. First, there's overt attention. In overt attention, you
move your eyes towards something in order to pay attention to it. Then there's covert
attention. In covert attention, you pay attention to something, but without moving your
eyes. Think of driving for a second. Your overt attention, your direction of the eyes, are
in front, but that's your covert attention which is constantly scanning the surrounding
area, where you don't actually look at them. I'm a computational neuroscientist, and I work
on cognitive brain-machine interfaces, or bringing together the brain and the computer. I
love brain patterns.

Brain patterns are important for us because based on them we can build models for the
computers, and based on these models computers can recognize how well our brain functions.
And if it doesn't function well, then these computers themselves can be used as assistive
devices for therapies. But that also means something, because choosing the wrong patterns
will give us the wrong models and therefore the wrong therapies. Right? In case of
attention, the fact that we can shift our attention not only by our eyes but also by
thinking â€” that makes covert attention an interesting model for computers. So I wanted to
know what are the brainwave patterns when you look overtly or when you look covertly. I
set up an experiment for that. In this experiment there are two flickering squares, one of
them flickering at a slower rate than the other one. Depending on which of these flickers
you are paying attention to, certain parts of your brain will start resonating in the same
rate as that flickering rate.

So by analyzing your brain signals, we can track where exactly you are watching or you are
paying attention to. So to see what happens in your brain when you pay overt attention, I
asked people to look directly in one of the squares and pay attention to it. In this case,
not surprisingly, we saw that these flickering squares appeared in their brain signals
which was coming from the back of their head, which is responsible for the processing of
your visual information. But I was really interested to see what happens in your brain
when you pay covert attention. So this time I asked people to look in the middle of the
screen and without moving their eyes, to pay attention to either of these squares. When we
did that, we saw that both of these flickering rates appeared in their brain signals, but
interestingly, only one of them, which was paid attention to, had stronger signals, so
there was something in the brain which was handling this information so that thing in the
brain was basically the activation of the frontal area.

The front part of your brain is responsible for higher cognitive functions as a human. The
frontal part, it seems that it works as a filter trying to let information come in only
from the right flicker that you are paying attention to and trying to inhibit the
information coming from the ignored one. The filtering ability of the brain is indeed a key
for attention, which is missing in some people, for example in people with ADHD. So a
person with ADHD cannot inhibit these distractors, and that's why they can't focus for a
long time on a single task. But what if this person could play a specific computer game
with his brain connected to the computer, and then train his own brain to inhibit these
distractors? Well, ADHD is just one example. We can use these cognitive brain-machine
interfaces for many other cognitive fields. It was just a few years ago that my
grandfather had a stroke, and he lost complete ability to speak.

He could understand everybody, but there was no way to respond, even not writing because
he was illiterate. So he passed away in silence. I remember thinking at that time: What if
we could have a computer which could speak for him? Now, after years that I am in this
field, I can see that this might be possible. Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns
when people think about images or even letters, like the letter A generates a different
brainwave pattern than the letter B, and so on. Could a computer one day communicate for
people who can't speak? What if a computer can help us understand the thoughts of a person
in a coma? We are not there yet, but pay close attention. We will be there soon. Thank
you.
