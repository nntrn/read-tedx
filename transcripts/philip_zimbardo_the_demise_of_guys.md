So today, I want us to reflect on the demise of guys. Guys are flaming out academically;
they're wiping out socially with girls and sexually with women. Other than that, there's
not much of a problem. So what's the data? So the data on dropping out is amazing. Boys
are 30 percent more likely than girls to drop out of school. In Canada, five boys drop out
for every three girls. Girls outperform boys now at every level, from elementary school to
graduate school. There's a 10 percent differential between getting BA's and all graduate
programs, with guys falling behind girls. Two-thirds of all students in special ed.
remedial programs are guys. And as you all know, boys are five times more likely than
girls to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder — and therefore we drug them with
Ritalin. What's the evidence of wiping out? First, it's a new fear of intimacy. Intimacy
means physical, emotional connection with somebody else — and especially with somebody of
the opposite sex who gives off ambiguous, contradictory, phosphorescent
signals.

And every year there's research done on self-reported shyness among college students. And
we're seeing a steady increase among males. And this is two kinds. It's a social
awkwardness. The old shyness was a fear of rejection. It's a social awkwardness like
you're a stranger in a foreign land. They don't know what to say, they don't know what to
do, especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex. They don't know the language of face
contact, the non-verbal and verbal set of rules that enable you to comfortably talk to
somebody else, listen to somebody else. There's something I'm developing here called social
intensity syndrome, which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over
female mating. It turns out, from earliest childhood, boys, and then men, prefer the
company of guys — physical company. And there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking
at, because guys have been with guys in teams, in clubs, in gangs, in fraternities,
especially in the military, and then in pubs.

And this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers,
watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers, rather than
Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom. The problem is they now prefer [the]
asynchronistic Internet world to the spontaneous interaction in social relationships. What
are the causes? Well, it's an unintended consequence. I think it's excessive Internet use
in general, excessive video gaming, excessive new access to pornography. The problem is
these are arousal addictions. Drug addiction, you simply want more. Arousal addiction, you
want different. Drugs, you want more of the same — different. So you need the novelty in
order for the arousal to be sustained. And the problem is the industry is supplying it.
Jane McGonigal told us last year that by the time a boy is 21, he's played 10,000 hours of
video games, most of that in isolation.

As you remember, Cindy Gallop said men don't know the difference between making love and
doing porn. The average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week. And there's some guy
watching a hundred, obviously. 

And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America — 15 billion annually.
For every 400 movies made in Hollywood, there are 11,000 now made porn videos. So the
effect, very quickly, is it's a new kind of arousal. Boys' brains are being digitally
rewired in a totally new way for change, novelty, excitement and constant arousal. That
means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes, which are analog, static,
interactively passive. They're also totally out of sync in romantic relationships, which
build gradually and subtly. So what's the solution? It's not my job. I'm here to alarm.
It's your job to solve.

But who should care? The only people who should care about this is parents of boys and
girls, educators, gamers, filmmakers and women who would like a real man who they can talk
to, who can dance, who can make love slowly and contribute to the evolutionary pressures
to keep our species above banana slugs. No offense to banana slug owners. Thank
you.
