title: How bones make blood
speaker: Melody Smith
description: >-
 Bones might seem rock-solid, but they're actually quite porous inside. Most of
 the large bones of your skeleton have a hollow core filled with soft bone marrow.
 Marrow's most essential elements are blood stem cells and for patients with
 advanced blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, the best chance for a cure is
 often a bone marrow transplant. How does this procedure work? Melody Smith
 explains. [Directed by Artrake Studio, narrated by Bethany Cutmore-Scott, music

At any given moment, trillions of cells are traveling through your blood vessels,
sometimes circling the body in just one minute. Each of these cells has its origins deep
in your bones. Bones might seem rock-solid, but they’re actually quite porous inside.
Large and small blood vessels enter through these holes. And inside most of the large
bones of your skeleton is a hollow core filled with soft bone marrow. Marrow contains fat
 and other supportive tissue, but its most essential elements are blood stem cells. These
stem cells are constantly dividing. They can differentiate into red blood cells, white
blood cells, and platelets, and send about hundreds of billions of new blood cells into
circulation every day. These new cells enter the bloodstream through holes in small
capillaries in the marrow. Through the capillaries, they reach larger blood vessels and
exit the bone. If there’s a problem with your blood, there’s a good chance it can be
traced back to the bone marrow.

Blood cancers often begin with genetic mutations in the stem cells. The stem cells
themselves are not cancerous, but these mutations can interfere with the process of
differentiation and result in malignant blood cells. So for patients with advanced blood
cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, the best chance for a cure is often an allogeneic
bone marrow transplant, which replaces the patient’s bone marrow with a donor’s. Here’s
how it works. First, blood stem cells are extracted from the donor. Most commonly, blood
stem cells are filtered out of the donor’s bloodstream by circulating the blood through
a machine that separates it into different components. In other cases, the marrow is
extracted directly from a bone in the hip, the iliac crest, with a needle. Meanwhile, the
recipient prepares for the transplant. High doses of chemotherapy or radiation kill the
patient’s existing marrow, destroying both malignant cells and blood stem
cells.

This also weakens the immune system, making it less likely to attack the transplanted
cells. Then the donor cells are infused into the patient’s body through a central line.
They initially circulate in the recipient’s peripheral bloodstream, but molecules on the
stem cells, called chemokines, act as homing devices and quickly traffic them back to
the marrow. Over the course of a few weeks, they begin to multiply and start producing
new, healthy blood cells. Just a small population of blood stem cells can regenerate a
whole body’s worth of healthy marrow. A bone marrow transplant can also lead to something
called graft-versus-tumor activity, when new immune cells generated by the donated marrow
can wipe out cancer cells the recipient’s original immune system couldn’t. This
phenomenon can help eradicate stubborn blood cancers. But bone marrow transplants also
come with risks, including graft-versus-host disease.

It happens when the immune system generated by the donor cells attacks the patient’s
organs. This life-threatening condition occurs in about 30–50% of patients who receive
donor cells from anyone other than an identical twin, particularly when the stem cells 
are collected from the blood as opposed to the bone marrow. Patients may take 
immunosuppressant medications or certain immune cells may be removed from the donated
sample in order to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease. But even if a patient 
avoids graft-versus-host disease, their immune system may reject the donor cells. So it’s
crucial to find the best match possible in the first place. Key regions of the genetic
code determine how the immune system identifies foreign cells. If these regions are
similar in the donor and the recipient, the recipient’s immune system is more likely to
accept the donor cells. Because these genes are inherited, the best matches are often
siblings.

But many patients who need a bone marrow transplant don’t have a matched family member.
Those patients turn to donor registries of volunteers willing to offer their bone
marrow. All it takes to be on the registry is a cheek swab to test for a genetic match.
And in many cases, the donation itself isn’t much more complicated than giving blood.
It’s a way to save someone’s life with a resource that’s completely renewable.
