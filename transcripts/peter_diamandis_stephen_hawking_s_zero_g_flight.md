Those of you who know me know how passionate I am about opening the space frontier. So
when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity the experience of zero
gravity, it was incredible. And I want to tell you that story. I first met him through the
Archon X PRIZE for Genomics. It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE, for the
first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days. We have something called the Genome
100 — 100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that. Craig Venter chairs that event. And
I met Professor Hawking, and he said his dream was to travel into space. And I said, "I
can't take you there, but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g. And he said, on
the spot, "Absolutely, yes." Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth is actually
with parabolic flight, weightless flight. You take an airplane, you fly over the top,
you're weightless for 25 seconds. Come back down, you weigh twice as much. You do it again
and again.

You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness — how NASA's trained their astronauts for
so long. We set out to do this. It took us 11 years to become operational. And we
announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking. We had one government agency and one
company aircraft operator say, you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the
guy.

And he wanted to go. We worked hard to get all the permissions. And six months later, we
sat down at Kennedy Space Center. We had a press conference, we announced our intent to do
one zero-g parabola, give him 25 seconds of zero-g. And if it went really well, we might
do three parabolas. Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this. And what he
said, for me, was very moving. He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of
being wiped out by disaster ... I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't
go into space. I therefore want to encourage public interest in space." We took him out to
the Kennedy Space Center, up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g
airplane. We had about 20 people who made donations — we raised $150,000 in donations for
children's charities — who flew with us. A few TEDsters here. We set up a whole ER. We had
four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.

We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure. We had
everything all set in case of an emergency; God knows, you don't want to hurt this
world-renowned expert. We took off from the shuttle landing facility, where the shuttle
takes off and lands. And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into
zero-g. Once he was there, [we] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly
like. And after that first parabola, you know, the doc said everything is great. He was
smiling, and we said go. So we did a second parabola.

And a third.

We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds
the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did. And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a
sixth.

And a seventh and an eighth. And this man does not look like a 65-year-old
wheelchair-bound man.

He was so happy. We are living on a precious jewel, and it's during our lifetime that
we're moving off this planet. Please join us in this epic adventure. Thank you so
much.
