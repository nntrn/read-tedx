Think back to a really vivid memory. Got it? Okay, now try to remember what you had for
lunch three weeks ago. That second memory probably isn't as strong, but why not? Why do
we remember some things, and not others? And why do memories eventually fade? Let's look
at how memories form in the first place. When you experience something, like dialing a
phone number, the experience is converted into a pulse of electrical energy that zips
along a network of neurons. Information first lands in short term memory, where it's
available from anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes. It's then transferred
to long-term memory through areas such as the hippocampus, and finally to several storage
regions across the brain. Neurons throughout the brain communicate at dedicated sites
called synapses using specialized neurotransmitters. If two neurons communicate
repeatedly, a remarkable thing happens: the efficiency of communication between them
increases.

This process, called long term potentiation, is considered to be a mechanism by which
memories are stored long-term, but how do some memories get lost? Age is one factor. As we
get older, synapses begin to falter and weaken, affecting how easily we can retrieve
memories. Scientists have several theories about what's behind this deterioration, from
actual brain shrinkage, the hippocampus loses 5% of its neurons every decade for a total
loss of 20% by the time you're 80 years old to the drop in the production of
neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine, which is vital to learning and memory. These
changes seem to affect how people retrieve stored information. Age also affects our
memory-making abilities. Memories are encoded most strongly when we're paying attention,
when we're deeply engaged, and when information is meaningful to us. Mental and physical
health problems, which tend to increase as we age, interfere with our ability to pay
attention, and thus act as memory thieves.

Another leading cause of memory problems is chronic stress. When we're constantly
overloaded with work and personal responsibilites, our bodies are on hyperalert. This
response has evolved from the physiological mechanism designed to make sure we can
survive in a crisis. Stress chemicals help mobilize energy and increase alertness.
However, with chronic stress our bodies become flooded with these chemicals, resulting in
a loss of brain cells and an inability to form new ones, which affects our ability to
retain new information. Depression is another culprit. People who are depressed are 40%
more likely to develop memory problems. Low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter
connected to arousal, may make depressed individuals less attentive to new information.
Dwelling on sad events in the past, another symptom of depression, makes it difficult to
pay attention to the present, affecting the ability to store short-term
memories.

Isolation, which is tied to depression, is another memory thief. A study by the Harvard
School of Public Health found that older people with high levels of social integration
had a slower rate of memory decline over a six-year period. The exact reason remains
unclear, but experts suspect that social interaction gives our brain a mental workout.
Just like muscle strength, we have to use our brain or risk losing it. But don't despair.
There are several steps you can take to aid your brain in preserving your memories. Make
sure you keep physically active. Increased blood flow to the brain is helpful. And eat
well. Your brain needs all the right nutrients to keep functioning correctly. And finally,
give your brain a workout. Exposing your brain to challenges, like learning a new
language, is one of the best defenses for keeping your memories intact.
