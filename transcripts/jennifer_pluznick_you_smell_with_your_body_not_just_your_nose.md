title: You smell with your body, not just your nose
speaker: Jennifer Pluznick
description: >-
 Do your kidneys have a sense of smell? Turns out, the same tiny scent detectors
 found in your nose are also found in some pretty unexpected places -- like your
 muscles, kidneys and even your lungs. In this quick talk (filled with weird
 facts), physiologist Jennifer Pluznick explains why they're there and what they
 do.

Here's a question for you: how many different scents do you think you can smell, and maybe
even identify with accuracy? 100? 300? 1,000? One study estimates that humans can detect
up to one trillion different odors. A trillion. It's hard to imagine, but your nose has
the molecular machinery to make it happen. Olfactory receptors — tiny scent detectors — are
packed into your nose, each one patiently waiting to be activated by the odor, or ligand,
that it's been assigned to detect. It turns out we humans, like all vertebrates, have lots
of olfactory receptors. In fact, more of our DNA is devoted to genes for different
olfactory receptors than for any other type of protein. Why is that? Could olfactory
receptors be doing something else in addition to allowing us to smell? In 1991, Linda Buck
and Richard Axel uncovered the molecular identity of olfactory receptors — work which
ultimately led to a Nobel Prize. At the time, we all assumed that these receptors were
only found in the nose.

However, about a year or so later, a report emerged of an olfactory receptor expressed in
a tissue other than the nose. And then another such report emerged, and another. We now
know that these receptors are found all over the body, including in some pretty unexpected
places — in muscle, in kidneys, lungs and blood vessels. But what are they doing there?
Well, we know that olfactory receptors act as sensitive chemical sensors in the nose —
that's how they mediate our sense of smell. It turns out they also act as sensitive
chemical sensors in many other parts of the body. Now, I'm not saying that your liver can
detect the aroma of your morning coffee as you walk into the kitchen. Rather, after you
drink your morning coffee, your liver might use an olfactory receptor to chemically detect
the change in concentration of a chemical floating through your bloodstream. Many cell
types and tissues in the body use chemical sensors, or chemosensors, to keep track of the
concentration of hormones, metabolites and other molecules, and some of these chemosensors
are olfactory receptors.

If you are a pancreas or a kidney and you need a specialized chemical sensor that will
allow you to keep track of a specific molecule, why reinvent the wheel? One of the first
examples of an olfactory receptor found outside the nose showed that human sperm express
an olfactory receptor, and that sperm with this receptor will seek out the chemical that
the receptor responds to — the receptor's ligand. That is, the sperm will swim toward the
ligand. This has intriguing implications. Are sperm aided in finding the egg by sniffing
out the area with the highest ligand concentration? I like this example because it clearly
demonstrates that an olfactory receptor's primary job is to be a chemical sensor, but
depending on the context, it can influence how you perceive a smell, or in which direction
sperm will swim, and as it turns out, a huge variety of other processes. Olfactory
receptors have been implicated in muscle cell migration, in helping the lung to sense and
respond to inhaled chemicals, and in wound healing. Similarly, taste receptors once thought
to be found only in the tongue, are now known to be expressed in cells and tissues
throughout the body.

Even more surprisingly, a recent study found that the light receptors in our eyes also
play a role in our blood vessels. In my lab, we work on trying to understand the roles of
olfactory receptors and taste receptors in the context of the kidney. The kidney is a
central control center for homeostasis. And to us, it makes sense that a homeostatic
control center would be a logical place to employ chemical sensors. We've identified a
number of different olfactory and taste receptors in the kidney, one of which, olfactory
receptor 78, is known to be expressed in cells and tissues that are important in the
regulation of blood pressure. When this receptor is deleted in mice, their blood pressure
is low. Surprisingly, this receptor was found to respond to chemicals called short-chain
fatty acids that are produced by the bacteria that reside in your gut — your gut
microbiota. After being produced by your gut microbiota, these chemicals are absorbed into
your bloodstream where they can then interact with receptors like olfactory receptor 78,
meaning that the changes in metabolism of your gut microbiota may influence your blood
pressure. Although we've identified a number of different olfactory and taste receptors in
the kidney, we've only just begun to tease out their different functions and to figure out
which chemicals each of them responds to.

Similar investigations lie ahead for many other organs and tissues — only a small minority
of receptors has been studied to date. This is exciting stuff. It's revolutionizing our
understanding of the scope of influence for one of the five senses. And it has the
potential to change our understanding of some aspects of human physiology. It's still
early, but I think we've picked up on the scent of something we're following.

Thank you.
