The human eye is an amazing mechanism, able to detect anywhere from a few photons to
direct sunlight, or switch focus from the screen in front of you to the distant horizon 
in a third of a second. In fact, the structures required for such incredible flexibility
were once considered so complex that Charles Darwin himself acknowledged that the idea of
there having evolved seemed absurd in the highest possible degree. And yet, that is
exactly what happened, starting more than 500 million years ago. The story of the human
eye begins with a simple light spot, such as the one found in single-celled organisms,
like euglena. This is a cluster of light-sensitive proteins linked to the organism's
flagellum, activating when it finds light and, therefore, food. A more complex version of
this light spot can be found in the flat worm, planaria. Being cupped, rather than flat,
enables it to better sense the direction of the incoming light.

Among its other uses, this ability allows an organism to seek out shade and hide from
predators. Over the millenia, as such light cups grew deeper in some organisms, the
opening at the front grew smaller. The result was a pinhole effect, which increased
resolution dramatically, reducing distortion by only allowing a thin beam of light into
the eye. The nautilus, an ancestor of the octopus, uses this pinhole eye for improved 
resolution and directional sensing. Although the pinhole eye allows for simple images, the
key step towards the eye as we know it is a lens. This is thought to have evolved through
transparent cells covering the opening to prevent infection, allowing the inside of the
eye to fill with fluid that optimizes light sensitivity and processing. Crystalline
proteins forming at the surface created a structure that proved useful in focusing light 
at a single point on the retina.

It is this lens that is the key to the eye's adaptability, changing its curvature to adapt
to near and far vision. This structure of the pinhole camera with a lens served as the
basis for what would eventually evolve into the human eye. Further refinements would
include a colored ring, called the iris, that controls the amount of light entering the
eye, a tough white outer layer, known as the sclera, to maintain its structure, and tear
glands that secrete a protective film. But equally important was the accompanying
evolution of the brain, with its expansion of the visual cortex to process the sharper and
more colorful images it was receiving. We now know that far from being an ideal
masterpiece of design, our eye bares traces of its step by step evolution. For example,
the human retina is inverted, with light-detecting cells facing away from the eye opening.
This results in a blind spot, where the optic nerve must pierce the retina to reach the
photosensitive layer in the back.

The similar looking eyes of cephalopods, which evolved independently, have a front-facing
retina, allowing them to see without a blind spot. Other creatures' eyes display different
adaptations. Anableps, the so called four-eyed fish, have eyes divided in two sections for
looking above and under water, perfect for spotting both predators and prey. Cats,
classically nighttime hunters, have evolved with a reflective layer maximizing the amount
of light the eye can detect, granting them excellent night vision, as well as their
signature glow. These are just a few examples of the huge diversity of eyes in the animal
kingdom. So if you could design an eye, would you do it any differently? This question
isn't as strange as it might sound. Today, doctors and scientists are looking at
different eye structures to help design biomechanical implants for the vision impaired.
And in the not so distant future, the machines built with the precision and flexibilty of
the human eye may even enable it to surpass its own evolution.
