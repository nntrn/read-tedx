"The Opposites Game" For Patricia Maisch This day my students and I play the Opposites
Game with a line from Emily Dickinson. My life had stood a loaded gun, it goes and I
write it on the board, pausing so they can call out the antonyms – My Your Life Death Had
stood ? Will sit A Many Loaded Empty Gun ? Gun. For a moment, very much like the one
between lightning and its sound, the children just stare at me, and then it comes, a
flurry, a hail storm of answers – Flower, says one. No, Book, says another. That's
stupid, cries a third, the opposite of a gun is a pillow. Or maybe a hug, but not a book,
 no way is it a book. With this, the others gather their thoughts and suddenly it’s a
shouting match. No one can agree, for every student there’s a final answer. It's a song,
a prayer, I mean a promise, like a wedding ring, and later a baby. Or what’s that person
who delivers babies? A midwife? Yes, a midwife. No, that’s wrong. You're so wrong you’ll
never be right again.

 It's a whisper, a star, it's saying I love you into your hand and then touching
someone's ear. Are you crazy? Are you the president of Stupid-land? You should be, 
When's the election? It’s a teddy bear, a sword, a perfect, perfect peach. Go back to the
first one, it's a flower, a white rose. When the bell rings, I reach for an eraser but a
girl snatches it from my hand. Nothing's decided, she says, We’re not done here. I leave
all the answers on the board. The next day some of them have stopped talking to each
other, they’ve taken sides. There's a Flower club. And a Kitten club. And two boys
calling themselves The Snowballs. The rest have stuck with the original game, which was
to try to write something like poetry. It's a diamond, it's a dance, the opposite of a gun
is a museum in France. It's the moon, it's a mirror, it's the sound of a bell and the
hearer. The arguing starts again, more shouting, and finally a new club. For the first
time I dare to push them.

Maybe all of you are right, I say. Well, maybe. Maybe it's everything we said. Maybe it’s
everything we didn't say. It's words and the spaces for words. They're looking at each
other now. It's everything in this room and outside this room and down the street and in
the sky. It's everyone on campus and at the mall, and all the people waiting at the
hospital. And at the post office. And, yeah, it's a flower, too. All the flowers. The
whole garden. The opposite of a gun is wherever you point it. Don’t write that on the
board, they say. Just say poem. Your death will sit through many empty
poems.
