title: Schrödinger's cat: A thought experiment in quantum mechanics
speaker: Chad Orzel
description: >-
 Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger, one of the founders of quantum mechanics,
 posed this famous question: If you put a cat in a sealed box with a device that
 has a 50% chance of killing the cat in the next hour, what will be the state of
 the cat when that time is up? Chad Orzel investigates this thought experiment.

Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger is one of the founders of quantum mechanics, but he's
most famous for something he never actually did: a thought experiment involving a cat. He
imagined taking a cat and placing it in a sealed box with a device that had a 50% chance
of killing the cat in the next hour. At the end of that hour, he asked, "What is the state
of the cat?" Common sense suggests that the cat is either alive or dead, but Schrödinger
pointed out that according to quantum physics, at the instant before the box is opened,
the cat is equal parts alive and dead, at the same time. It's only when the box is opened
that we see a single definite state. Until then, the cat is a blur of probability, half
one thing and half the other. This seems absurd, which was Schrödinger's point. He found
quantum physics so philosophically disturbing, that he abandoned the theory he had helped
make and turned to writing about biology.

As absurd as it may seem, though, Schrödinger's cat is very real. In fact, it's essential.
If it weren't possible for quantum objects to be in two states at once, the computer
you're using to watch this couldn't exist. The quantum phenomenon of superposition is a
consequence of the dual particle and wave nature of everything. In order for an object to
have a wavelength, it must extend over some region of space, which means it occupies many
positions at the same time. The wavelength of an object limited to a small region of space
can't be perfectly defined, though. So it exists in many different wavelengths at the same
time. We don't see these wave properties for everyday objects because the wavelength
decreases as the momentum increases. And a cat is relatively big and heavy. If we took a
single atom and blew it up to the size of the Solar System, the wavelength of a cat 
running from a physicist would be as small as an atom within that Solar
System.

That's far too small to detect, so we'll never see wave behavior from a cat. A tiny
particle, like an electron, though, can show dramatic evidence of its dual nature. If we
shoot electrons one at a time at a set of two narrow slits cut in a barrier, each electron
on the far side is detected at a single place at a specific instant, like a particle. But
if you repeat this experiment many times, keeping track of all the individual
detections, you'll see them trace out a pattern that's characteristic of wave behavior: a
set of stripes - regions with many electrons separated by regions where there are none at
all. Block one of the slits and the stripes go away. This shows that the pattern is a
result of each electron going through both slits at the same time. A single electron isn't
choosing to go left or right but left and right simultaneously. This superposition of
states also leads to modern technology. An electron near the nucleus of an atom exists in
a spread out, wave-like orbit.

Bring two atoms close together, and the electrons don't need to choose just one atom but
are shared between them. This is how some chemical bonds form. An electron in a molecule
isn't on just atom A or atom B, but A+ B. As you add more atoms, the electrons spread out
more, shared between vast numbers of atoms at the same time. The electrons in a solid
aren't bound to a particular atom but shared among all of them, extending over a large
range of space. This gigantic superposition of states determines the ways electrons move
through the material, whether it's a conductor or an insulator or a semiconductor.
Understanding how electrons are shared among atoms allows us to precisely control the
properties of semiconductor materials, like silicon. Combining different semiconductors in
the right way allows us to make transistors on a tiny scale, millions on a single
computer chip. Those chips and their spread out electrons power the computer you're using
to watch this video.

An old joke says that the Internet exists to allow the sharing of cat videos. At a very
deep level, though, the Internet owes its existance to an Austrian physicist and his
imaginary cat.
