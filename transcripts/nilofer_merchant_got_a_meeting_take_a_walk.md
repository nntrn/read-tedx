 life and health: Next time you have a one-on-one meeting, make it into a "walking
 meeting" -- and let ideas flow while you walk and talk.

What you're doing, right now, at this very moment, is killing you. More than cars or the
Internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about, the technology you're
using the most almost every day is this, your tush. Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours
a day, which is more than we're sleeping, at 7.7 hours. Sitting is so incredibly
prevalent, we don't even question how much we're doing it, and because everyone else is
doing it, it doesn't even occur to us that it's not okay. In that way, sitting has become
the smoking of our generation. Of course there's health consequences to this, scary ones,
besides the waist. Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our
lack of physical [activity], Ten percent in fact, on both of those. Six percent for heart
disease, seven percent for type 2 diabetes, which is what my father died of. Now, any of
those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more, but if you're anything
like me, it won't. What did get me moving was a social interaction.

Someone invited me to a meeting, but couldn't manage to fit me in to a regular sort of
conference room meeting, and said, "I have to walk my dogs tomorrow. Could you come then?"
It seemed kind of odd to do, and actually, that first meeting, I remember thinking, "I
have to be the one to ask the next question," because I knew I was going to huff and puff
during this conversation. And yet, I've taken that idea and made it my own. So instead of
going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings, I ask people to go
on a walking meeting, to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week. It's changed my life. But
before that, what actually happened was, I used to think about it as, you could take care
of your health, or you could take care of obligations, and one always came at the cost of
the other. So now, several hundred of these walking meetings later, I've learned a few
things. First, there's this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads
to out-of-the-box thinking.

Whether it's nature or the exercise itself, it certainly works. And second, and probably
the more reflective one, is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition
when they're really not that way. And if we're going to solve problems and look at the
world really differently, whether it's in governance or business or environmental issues,
job creation, maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things
be true. Because it was when that happened with this walk-and-talk idea that things became
doable and sustainable and viable. So I started this talk talking about the tush, so I'll
end with the bottom line, which is, walk and talk. Walk the talk. You'll be surprised at
how fresh air drives fresh thinking, and in the way that you do, you'll bring into your
life an entirely new set of ideas. Thank you.
