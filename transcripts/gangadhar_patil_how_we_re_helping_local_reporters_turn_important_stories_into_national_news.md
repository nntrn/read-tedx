title: How we're helping local reporters turn important stories into national news
speaker: Gangadhar Patil
description: >-
 Local reporters are on the front lines of important stories, but their work often
 goes unnoticed by national and international news outlets. TED Fellow and
 journalist Gangadhar Patil is working to change that. In this quick talk, he
 shows how he's connecting grassroots reporters in India with major news outlets
 worldwide -- and helping elevate and expose stories that might never get covered
 otherwise.

I'm a journalist. And I know how frustrating it gets when most of your stories go
unnoticed. I felt it when I worked as a local reporter in my hometown Belgaum, in India. I
thought maybe joining a national newspaper would help. So I went through professional
training and worked with India's three national newspapers. During my five-year stint, I
used to travel for my stories. It was in early 2012 I traveled 1,000 miles from Mumbai to
a coastal village in south India. I was there to do a story on environmental risk of a
nuclear power plant. When I spoke to a local activist, he said the story of hundreds of
villagers protesting against a nuclear power plant was reported by local media six months
before national TV channels picked it up. I had similar experiences when I traveled for
other stories. It confirmed my belief that a local reporter knows a story much before it
is picked up by national media.

But like me, they did not have a platform to share them. According to a 2011 media study,
only two percent of India's mainstream media coverage is about rural issues. Even though
almost 70 percent of India's population, 1.3 billion population, live in villages. This is
disturbing for a democratic country like India, where transparency is key to ensure
justice to everyone, especially the poor. I was convinced that there's a need to build a
platform to bring out this important story at the national level. So I quit my job with
"Economic Times" in December 2014. For the next six months, I freelanced and also built a
database of 20,000 local reporters across India. During that time, I saw editors who were
looking for more and more contributors as news organizations cut down cost by getting rid
of hundreds of full-time reporters. I saw an opportunity to highlight these important
stories if I can train these local reporters and connect them with the mainstream
media. And that is exactly what we are doing.

Our tech platform, for the first time, discovers a local reporter, grooms them, and helps
them write for national and international publications. A team of experienced editors
works closely with these local reporters on each and every story filed by them. This
process not only helps the local reporters learn reporting skills but also gives
credibility to their stories. In June 2017, one of our local reporters, Saurabh Sharma, won
an international award from the European Commission for his story on the hardships faced
by young girls living on the street. We're also trying to correct market for these local
reporters, by paying them three times more than the existing rates. Better pay and
recognition is giving them confidence to dig deeper and expose corruption in the system
and society. We recently reported a story from Northeast India where children have to cross
a river in a huge cooking pot, risking their life every day, because there's no bridge,
there's no boat.

The story was picked up by mainstream media and it caught the attention of a local elected
representative who promised to build a bridge. In the last three years of our operations,
we have reported more than 2,500 such stories. To publish them for a wider reach and
impact, we have partnered with 16 leading media houses, who are happy to take them, as it
brings their cost down, by not editing or managing reporters. Today, we have more than
1,200 reporters in our network, covering stories like the nuclear power plant, from places
that are either ignored by mainstream media or never covered. In the next five years, we
plan to have one reporter in each of the 5,500 subdistricts in India, covering the entire
nation, to ensure that none of these important stories go unnoticed. Next time you see a
story from the countryside, please do not ignore it. Do read and share them, they might be
breaking stories.

This way, we can ensure none of the important stories go unnoticed. Thank
you.
