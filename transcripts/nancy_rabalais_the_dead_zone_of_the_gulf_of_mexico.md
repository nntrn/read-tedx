title: The "dead zone" of the Gulf of Mexico
speaker: Nancy Rabalais
description: >-
 Ocean expert Nancy Rabalais tracks the ominously named "dead zone" in the Gulf of
 Mexico -- where there isn't enough oxygen in the water to support life. The Gulf
 has the second largest dead zone in the world; on top of killing fish and
 crustaceans, it's also killing fisheries in these waters. Rabalais tells us about
 what's causing it -- and how we can reverse its harmful effects and restore one
 of America's natural treasures.

Good evening, welcome to New Orleans. I don't know if you knew this, but you are sitting
within 15 minutes of one of the largest rivers in the world: the Mississippi river. Old
Man River, Big Muddy. And it goes as far north as the state of Minnesota, as far east as
the state of New York, as far west as Montana. And 100 miles from here, river miles, it
empties its fresh water and sediments into the Gulf of Mexico. That's the end of Geography
101.

Now we're going to go to what is in that water. Besides the sediment, there are dissolved
molecules, nitrogen and phosphorus. And those, through a biological process, lead to the
formation of areas called dead zones. Now, dead zone is a quite ominous word if you're a
fish or a crab.

Even a little worm in the sediments. Which means that there's not enough oxygen for those
animals to survive. So, how does this happen? The nitrogen and the phosphorus stimulate the
growth of microscopic plants called phytoplankton. And small animals called zooplankton
eat the phytoplankton, small fish eat the zooplankton, large fish eat the small fish and
it goes on up into the food web. The problem is that there's just too much nitrogen and
phosphorus right now, too much phytoplankton falling to the bottom and decomposed by
bacteria that use up the oxygen. That's the biology. Now, you can't see it from the surface
of the water, you can't see it in satellite images, so how do we know it's there? Well, a
trawler can tell you, when she puts her net over the side and drags for 20 minutes and
comes up empty, that she knows she's in the dead zone. And she has to go somewhere else.
But where else do you go if this area is 8,000 square miles big? About the size of the
state of New Jersey.

Well, you either make a decision to go further, without much economic return, or go back
to the dock. As a scientist, I have access to high-tech equipment that we can put over the
side of the research vessel, and it measures oxygen and many more things. We start at the
Mississippi River, we crisscross the Gulf of Mexico all the way to Texas, and even I sneak
into Texas every now and then and test their waters. And you can tell by the bottom oxygen
— you can draw a map of everything that's less than two, which is the magic number for
when the fish start to leave the area. I also dive in this dead zone. We have oxygen
meters that we have to deploy offshore that tell us continuous measurements of low oxygen
or high oxygen. And when you get into the water, there's a lot of fish. Tons of fish, all
kinds of fish, including my buddy here, the barracuda that I saw one day. Everybody else
swam this way and I went this way with my camera.

And then, down at 30 feet you start to see fewer fish. And then you get to the bottom. And
you don't see any fish. There's no life on the platform, there's no life swimming around.
And you know you're in the dead zone. So, what's the connection between the middle of the
United States and the Gulf of Mexico? Well, most of the watershed is farmland. And in
particular, corn-soybean rotation. The nitrogen that is put in fertilizers and the
phosphorus goes on the land and drains off into the Mississippi River and ends up in the
Gulf of Mexico. There's three times more nitrogen in the water in the Mississippi now,
than there was in the 1950s. Three times. And phosphorus has doubled. And what that means
is more phytoplankton and more sinking sails and lower oxygen. This is not a natural
feature of the Gulf; it's been caused by human activities. The landscape is not what it
used to be. It used to be prairies and forests and prairie potholes and duck areas and all
kinds of stuff.

But not anymore — it's row crops. And there are ways that we can address this type of
agriculture by using less fertilizer, maybe precision fertilizing. And trying some
sustainable agriculture such as perennial wheatgrass, which has much longer roots than the
six inches of a corn plant, that can keep the nitrogen on the soil and keep the soil from
running off. And how do we convince our neighbors to the north, maybe 1,000 miles away or
more, that their activities are causing problems with water quality in the Gulf of
Mexico? First of all, we can take them to their own backyard. If you want to go swimming in
Wisconsin in the summer in your favorite watering hole, you might find something like this
which looks like spilled green paint and smells like it, growing on the surface of the
water. This is a toxic blue-green algal bloom and it is not good for you. Similarly, in
Lake Erie, couple of summers ago there was hundreds of miles of this blue-green algae and
the city of Toledo, Ohio, couldn't use it for their drinking water for several days on
end.

And if you watch the news, you know that lots of communities are having trouble with
drinking water. I'm a scientist. I don't know if you could tell that.

And I do solid science, I publish my results, my colleagues read them, I get citations of
my work. But I truly believe that, as a scientist, using mostly federal funds to do the
research, I owe it to the public, to agency heads and congressional people to share my
knowledge with them so they can use it, hopefully to make better decisions about our
environmental policy.

Thank you.

One of the ways that I was able to do this is I brought in the media. And Joby Warrick
from the "Washington Post" put this picture in an article on the front page, Sunday
morning, two inches above the fold. That's a big deal. And Senator John Breaux, from
Louisiana, said, "Oh my gosh, that's what they think the Gulf of Mexico looks like?" And I
said, "Well, you know, there's the proof." And we've go to do something about it. At the
same time, Senator Olympia Snowe from Maine was having trouble with harmful algal blooms
in the Gulf of Maine. They joined forces — it was bipartisan —

And invited me to give congressional testimony, and I said, "Oh, all I've done is chase
crabs around south Texas, I don't know how to do that."

But I did it.

And eventually, the bill passed. And it was called — yeah, yay! It was called The Harmful
Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998.

Thank you. Which is why we call it the Snowe-Breaux Bill.

The other thing is that we had a conference in 2001 that was put on by the National
Academy of Sciences that looked at fertilizers, nitrogen and poor water quality. Our
plenary speaker was the former governor of the state of New Jersey. And she ... There was
no thinking she wasn't serious when she peered at the audience, and I thought, "Surely
she's looking at me." "You know, I'm really tired of this thing being called New Jersey.
Pick another state, any state, I just don't want to hear it anymore." But she was able to
move the action plan across President George H.W. Bush's desk so that we had environmental
goals and that we were working to solve them. The Midwest does not feed the world. It
feeds a lot of chickens, hogs, cattle and it generates ethanol to put into our gasoline,
which is regulated by federal policy. We can do better than this. We need to make
decisions that make us less consumptive and reduce our reliance on nitrogen.

It's like a carbon footprint. But you can reduce your nitrogen footprint. I do it by not
eating much meat — I still like a little every now and then — not using corn oil, driving
a car that I can put nonethanol gas in and get better gas mileage. Just things like that
that can make a difference. So I'm challenging, not just you, but I challenge a lot of
people, especially in the Midwest — think about how you're treating your land and how you
can make a difference. So my steps are very small steps. To change the type of agriculture
in the US is going to be many big steps. And it's going to take political and social will
for that to happen. But we can do it. I strongly believe we can translate the science,
bridge it to policy and make a difference in our environment. We all want a clean
environment. And we can work together to do this so that we no longer have these dead
zones in the Gulf of Mexico. Thank you.
