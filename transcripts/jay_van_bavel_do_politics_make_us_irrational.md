title: Do politics make us irrational?
speaker: Jay Van Bavel
description: >-
 Can someone's political identity actually affect their ability to process
 information? The answer lies in a cognitive phenomenon known as partisanship.
 While identifying with social groups is an essential and healthy part of life, it
 can become a problem when the group's beliefs are at odds with reality. So how
 can we recognize and combat partisanship? Jay Van Bavel shares helpful strategies.

In 2013, a team of researchers held a math test. The exam was administered to over 1,100
American adults, and designed, in part, to test their ability to evaluate sets of data.
Hidden among these math problems were two almost identical questions. Both problems used
the same difficult data set, and each had one objectively correct answer. The first asked
about the correlation between rashes and a new skin cream. The second asked about the
correlation between crime rates and gun control legislation. Participants with strong math
skills were much more likely to get the first question correct. But despite being 
mathematically identical, the results for the second question looked totally different.
Here, math skills weren’t the best predictor of which participants answered correctly.
Instead, another variable the researchers had been tracking came into play: political
identity. Participants whose political beliefs aligned with a correct interpretation of
the data were far more likely to answer the problem right.

Even the study’s top mathematicians were 45% more likely to get the second question wrong
when the correct answer challenged their political beliefs. What is it about politics that
inspires this kind of illogical error? Can someone’s political identity actually affect
their ability to process information? The answer lies in a cognitive phenomenon that has
become increasingly visible in public life: partisanship. While it’s often invoked in the
context of politics, partisanship is more broadly defined as a strong preference or bias
towards any particular group or idea. Our political, ethnic, religious, and national
identities are all different forms of partisanship. Of course, identifying with social
groups is an essential and healthy part of human life. Our sense of self is defined not
only by who we are as individuals, but also by the groups we belong to. As a result,
we’re strongly motivated to defend our group identities, protecting both our sense of
self and our social communities. But this becomes a problem when the group’s beliefs are
at odds with reality.

Imagine watching your favorite sports team commit a serious foul. You know that’s against
the rules, but your fellow fans think it’s totally acceptable. The tension between these
two incompatible thoughts is called cognitive dissonance, and most people are driven to
resolve this uncomfortable state of limbo. You might start to blame the referee, 
complain that the other team started it, or even convince yourself there was no foul in
the first place. In a case like this, people are often more motivated to maintain a
positive relationship with their group than perceive the world accurately. This behavior 
is especially dangerous in politics. On an individual scale, allegiance to a party allows
people to create a political identity and support policies they agree with. But
partisan-based cognitive dissonance can lead people to reject evidence that’s
inconsistent with the party line or discredits party leaders.

And when entire groups of people revise the facts in service of partisan beliefs, it can
lead to policies that aren’t grounded in truth or reason. This problem isn’t new—
political identities have been around for centuries. But studies show that partisan
polarization has increased dramatically in the last few decades. One theory explaining
this increase is the trend towards clustering geographically in like-minded communities.
Another is the growing tendency to rely on partisan news or social media bubbles. These
often act like echo chambers, delivering news and ideas from people with similar
views. Fortunately, cognitive scientists have uncovered some strategies for resisting this
distortion filter. One is to remember that you’re probably more biased than you think. So
when you encounter new information, make a deliberate effort to push through your initial
intuition and evaluate it analytically.

In your own groups, try to make fact-checking and questioning assumptions a valued part
of the culture. Warning people that they might have been presented with misinformation
can also help. And when you’re trying to persuade someone else, affirming their values 
and framing the issue in their language can help make people more receptive. We still have
a long way to go before solving the problem of partisanship. But hopefully, these tools 
can help keep us better informed, and capable of making evidence-based decisions about
our shared reality.
