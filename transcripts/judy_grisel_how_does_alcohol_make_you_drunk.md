Ethanol: this molecule, made of little more than a few carbon atoms, is responsible for
drunkenness. Often simply referred to as alcohol, ethanol is the active ingredient in
alcoholic beverages. Its simplicity helps it sneak across membranes and nestle into a
many different nooks, producing a wide range of effects compared to other, clunkier
molecules. So how exactly does it cause drunkenness, and why does it have dramatically 
different effects on different people? To answer these questions, we’ll need to follow
alcohol on its journey through the body. Alcohol lands in the stomach and is absorbed
into the blood through the digestive tract, especially the small intestine. The contents
of the stomach impact alcohol’s ability to get into the blood because after eating, the
pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach from the small intestine, closes. So the
level of alcohol that reaches the blood after a big meal might only be a quarter that
from the same drink on an empty stomach. From the blood, alcohol goes to the organs,
especially those that get the most blood flow: the liver and the brain.

It hits the liver first, and enzymes in the liver break down the alcohol molecule in two
steps. First, an enzyme called ADH turns alcohol into acetaldehyde, which is toxic. Then,
an enzyme called ALDH converts the toxic acetaldehyde to non-toxic acetate. As the blood
circulates, the liver eliminates alcohol continuously— but this first pass of elimination
 determines how much alcohol reaches the brain and other organs. Brain sensitivity is
responsible for the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral effects of alcohol— otherwise
known as drunkenness. Alcohol turns up the brain’s primary brake, the neurotransmitter
GABA, and turns down its primary gas, the neurotransmitter glutamate. This makes neurons 
much less communicative, and users feel relaxed at moderate doses, fall asleep at higher
doses, and can impede the brain activity necessary for survival at toxic doses. Alcohol
also stimulates a small group of neurons that extends from the midbrain to the nucleus
accumbens, a region important for motivation.

Like all addictive drugs, it prompts a squirt of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens which
gives users a surge of pleasure. Alcohol also causes some neurons to synthesize and
release endorphins. Endorphins help us to calm down in response to stress or danger.
Elevated levels of endorphins contribute to the euphoria and relaxation associated with
alcohol consumption. Finally, as the liver’s breakdown of alcohol outpaces the brain’s
absorption, drunkenness fades away. Individual differences at any point in this journey
can cause people to act more or less drunk. For example, a man and a woman who weigh the
same and drink the same amount during an identical meal will still have different blood
alcohol concentrations, or BACs. This is because women tend to have less blood— women
generally have a higher percentage of fat, which requires less blood than muscle. A
smaller blood volume, carrying the same amount of alcohol, means the concentration will
be higher for women.

Genetic differences in the liver’s alcohol processing enzymes also influence BAC. And
regular drinking can increase production of these enzymes, contributing to tolerance. On
the other hand, those who drink excessively for a long time may develop liver damage,
which has the opposite effect. Meanwhile, genetic differences in dopamine, GABA, and
endorphin transmission may contribute to risk for developing an alcohol use disorder.
Those with naturally low endorphin or dopamine levels may self-medicate through drinking.
Some people have a higher risk for excessive drinking due to a sensitive endorphin
response that increases the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Others have a variation in
GABA transmission that makes them especially sensitive to the sedative effects of
alcohol, which decreases their risk of developing disordered drinking. Meanwhile, the
brain adapts to chronic alcohol consumption by reducing GABA, dopamine, and endorphin
transmission, and enhancing glutamate activity.

This means regular drinkers tend to be anxious, have trouble sleeping, and experience
less pleasure. These structural and functional changes can lead to disordered use when
drinking feels normal, but not drinking is uncomfortable, establishing a vicious cycle. So
both genetics and previous experience impact how a person experiences alcohol— which
means that some people are more prone to certain patterns of drinking than others, and a
history of consumption leads to neural and behavioral changes.
