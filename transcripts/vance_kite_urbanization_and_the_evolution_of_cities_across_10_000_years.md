title: Urbanization and the evolution of cities across 10,000 years
speaker: Vance Kite
description: >-
 About 10,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers, aided by rudimentary agriculture, moved
 to semi-permanent villages and never looked back. With further developments came
 food surpluses, leading to commerce, specialization and, many years later with
 the Industrial Revolution, the modern city. Vance Kite plots our urban past and
 how we can expect future cities to adapt to our growing populations. [Directed by
 Keaton Tips, narrated by Michelle Snow].

Today ,more than half of all people in the world live in an urban area. By mid-century,
this will increase to 70%. But as recently as 100 years ago, only two out of ten people
lived in a city, and before that, it was even less. How have we reached such a high degree
of urbanization, and what does it mean for our future? In the earliest days of human
history, humans were hunter-gatherers, often moving from place to place in search of food.
But about 10,000 years ago, our ancestors began to learn the secrets of selective breeding
and early agricultural techniques. For the first time, people could raise food rather than
search for it, and this led to the development of semi-permanent villages for the first
time in history. "Why only semi-permanent?" you might ask. Well, at first, the villages
still had to relocate every few years as the soil became depleted. It was only with the
advent of techniques like irrigation and soil tilling about 5,000 years ago that people
could rely on a steady and long-term supply of food, making permanent settlements
possible.

And with the food surpluses that these techniques produced, it was no longer necessary for
everyone to farm. This allowed the development of other specialized trades, and, by
extension, cities. With cities now producing surplus food, as well as tools, crafts, and
other goods, there was now the possibility of commerce and interaction over longer
distances. And as trade flourished, so did technologies that facilitated it, like carts,
ships, roads, and ports. Of course, these things required even more labor to build and
maintain, so more people were drawn from the countryside to the cities as more jobs and
opportunities became available. If you think modern cities are overcrowded, you may be
surprised to learn that some cities in 2000 B.C. had population densities nearly twice as
high as that of Shanghai or Calcutta. One reason for this was that transportation was not
widely available, so everything had to be within walking distance, including the few
sources of clean water that existed then.

And the land area of the city was further restricted by the need for walls to defend
against attacks. The Roman Empire was able to develop infrastructure to overcome these
limitations, but other than that, modern cities as we know them, didn't really get their
start until the Industrial Revolution, when new technology deployed on a mass scale
allowed cities to expand and integrate further, establishing police, fire, and sanitation
departments, as well as road networks, and later electricity distribution. So, what is the
future of cities? Global population is currently more than 7 billion and is predicted to
top out around 10 billion. Most of this growth will occur in the urban areas of the
world's poorest countries. So, how will cities need to change to accommodate this growth?
First, the world will need to seek ways to provide adequate food, sanitation, and
education for all people. Second, growth will need to happen in a way that does not damage
the land that provides us with the goods and services that support the human
population.

Food production might move to vertical farms and skyscrapers, rooftop gardens, or vacant
lots in city centers, while power will increasingly come from multiple sources of
renewable energy. Instead of single-family homes, more residences will be built
vertically. We may see buildings that contain everything that people need for their daily
life, as well as a smaller, self-sufficient cities focused on local and sustainable
production. The future of cities is diverse, malleable, and creative, no longer built
around a single industry, but reflecting an increasingly connected and global
world.
