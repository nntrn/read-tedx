Take a look at this drawing. Can you tell what it is? I'm a molecular biologist by
training, and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings. They're usually referred to as a
model figure, a drawing that shows how we think a cellular or molecular process occurs.
This particular drawing is of a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It's a
process by which a molecule can get from the outside of the cell to the inside by getting
captured in a bubble or a vesicle that then gets internalized by the cell. There's a
problem with this drawing, though, and it's mainly in what it doesn't show. From lots of
experiments, from lots of different scientists, we know a lot about what these molecules
look like, how they move around in the cell, and that this is all taking place in an
incredibly dynamic environment. So in collaboration with a clathrin expert Tomas
Kirchhausen, we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that. So
we start outside of the cell.

Now we're looking inside. Clathrin are these three-legged molecules that can self-assemble
into soccer-ball-like shapes. Through connections with a membrane, clathrin is able to
deform the membrane and form this sort of a cup that forms this sort of a bubble, or a
vesicle, that's now capturing some of the proteins that were outside of the cell. Proteins
are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle, making it separate from the rest
of the membrane, and now clathrin is basically done with its job, and so proteins are
coming in now — we've covered them yellow and orange — that are responsible for taking
apart this clathrin cage. And so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used
all over again. These processes are too small to be seen directly, even with the best
microscopes, so animations like this provide a really powerful way of visualizing a
hypothesis. Here's another illustration, and this is a drawing of how a researcher might
think that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells.

And again, this is a vast oversimplification and doesn't begin to show what we actually
know about these processes. You might be surprised to know that these simple drawings are
the only way that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses. Why? Because
creating movies of processes as we think they actually occur is really hard. I spent
months in Hollywood learning 3D animation software, and I spend months on each animation,
and that's just time that most researchers can't afford. The payoffs can be huge, though.
Molecular animations are unparalleled in their ability to convey a great deal of
information to broad audiences with extreme accuracy. And I'm working on a new project now
called "The Science of HIV" where I'll be animating the entire life cycle of the HIV virus
as accurately as possible and all in molecular detail. The animation will feature data
from thousands of researchers collected over decades, data on what this virus looks like,
how it's able to infect cells in our body, and how therapeutics are helping to combat
infection. Over the years, I found that animations aren't just useful for communicating an
idea, but they're also really useful for exploring a hypothesis.

Biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil to visualize the processes
they study, and with the data we have now, that's just not good enough anymore. The
process of creating an animation can act as a catalyst that allows researchers to
crystalize and refine their own ideas. One researcher I worked with who works on the
molecular mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases came up with experiments that were
related directly to the animation that she and I worked on together, and in this way,
animation can feed back into the research process. I believe that animation can change
biology. It can change the way that we communicate with one another, how we explore our
data and how we teach our students. But for that change to happen, we need more
researchers creating animations, and toward that end, I brought together a team of
biologists, animators and programmers to create a new, free, open-source software — we
call it Molecular Flipbook — that's created just for biologists just to create molecular
animations.

From our testing, we've found that it only takes 15 minutes for a biologist who has never
touched animation software before to create her first molecular animation of her own
hypothesis. We're also building an online database where anyone can view, download and
contribute their own animations. We're really excited to announce that the beta version of
the molecular animation software toolkit will be available for download today. We are
really excited to see what biologists will create with it and what new insights they're
able to gain from finally being able to animate their own model figures. Thank
you.
