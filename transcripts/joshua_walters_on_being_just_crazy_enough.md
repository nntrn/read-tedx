 At TED's Full Spectrum Auditions, comedian Joshua Walters, who's bipolar, walks

My name is Joshua Walters. I'm a performer.

But as far as being a performer, I'm also diagnosed bipolar. I reframe that as a positive
because the crazier I get onstage, the more entertaining I become. When I was 16 in San
Francisco, I had my breakthrough manic episode in which I thought I was Jesus Christ.
Maybe you thought that was scary, but actually there's no amount of drugs you can take
that can get you as high as if you think you're Jesus Christ.

I was sent to a place, a psych ward, and in the psych ward, everyone is doing their own
one-man show. 

There's no audience like this to justify their rehearsal time. They're just practicing.
One day they'll get here. Now when I got out, I was diagnosed and I was given medications
by a psychiatrist. "Okay, Josh, why don't we give you some — why don't we give you some
Zyprexa. Okay? Mmhmm? At least that's what it says on my pen." 

Some of you are in the field, I can see. I can feel your noise. The first half of high
school was the struggle of the manic episode, and the second half was the overmedications
of these drugs, where I was sleeping through high school. The second half was just one big
nap, pretty much, in class. When I got out I had a choice. I could either deny my mental
illness or embrace my mental skillness.(Bugle sound)There's a movement going on right now
to reframe mental illness as a positive — at least the hypomanic edge part of it. Now if
you don't know what hypomania is, it's like an engine that's out of control, maybe a
Ferrari engine, with no breaks. Many of the speakers here, many of you in the audience,
have that creative edge, if you know what I'm talking about. You're driven to do something
that everyone has told you is impossible. And there's a book — John Gartner. John Gartner
wrote this book called "The Hypomanic Edge" in which Christopher Columbus and Ted Turner
and Steve Jobs and all these business minds have this edge to compete.

A different book was written not too long ago in the mid-90s called "Touched With Fire" by
Kay Redfield Jamison in which it was looked at in a creative sense in which Mozart and
Beethoven and Van Gogh all have this manic depression that they were suffering with. Some
of them committed suicide. So it wasn't all the good side of the illness. Now recently,
there's been development in this field. And there was an article written in the New York
Times, September 2010, that stated: "Just Manic Enough." Just be manic enough in which
investors who are looking for entrepreneurs that have this kind of spectrum — you know
what I'm talking about — not maybe full bipolar, but they're in the bipolar spectrum —
where on one side, maybe you think you're Jesus, and on the other side maybe they just
make you a lot of money. 

Your call. Your call. And everyone's somewhere in the middle. Everyone's somewhere in the
middle. So maybe, you know, there's no such thing as crazy, and being diagnosed with a
mental illness doesn't mean you're crazy. But maybe it just means you're more sensitive to
what most people can't see or feel. Maybe no one's really crazy. Everyone is just a little
bit mad. How much depends on where you fall in the spectrum. How much depends on how lucky
you are. Thank you.
