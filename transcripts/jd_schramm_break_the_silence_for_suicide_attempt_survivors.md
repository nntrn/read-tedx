title: Break the silence for suicide attempt survivors
speaker: JD Schramm
description: >-
 Even when our lives appear fine from the outside, locked within can be a world of
 quiet suffering, leading some to the decision to end their life. At TEDYou, JD
 Schramm asks us to break the silence surrounding suicide and suicide attempts,
 and to create much-needed resources to help people who reclaim their life after
 escaping death. Resources: http://t.co/wsNrY9C

From all outward appearances, John had everything going for him. He had just signed the
contract to sell his New York apartment at a six-figure profit, and he'd only owned it for
five years. The school where he graduated from with his master's had just offered him a
teaching appointment, which meant not only a salary, but benefits for the first time in
ages. And yet, despite everything going really well for John, he was struggling, fighting
addiction and a gripping depression. On the night of June 11th, 2003, he climbed up to the
edge of the fence on the Manhattan Bridge and he leaped to the treacherous waters below.
Remarkably — no, miraculously — he lived. The fall shattered his right arm, broke every
rib that he had, punctured his lung, and he drifted in and out of consciousness as he
drifted down the East River, under the Brooklyn Bridge and out into the pathway of the
Staten Island Ferry, where passengers on the ferry heard his cries of pain, contacted the
boat's captain who contacted the Coast Guard who fished him out of the East River and took
him to Bellevue Hospital. And that's actually where our story begins.

Because once John committed himself to putting his life back together — first physically,
then emotionally, and then spiritually — he found that there were very few resources
available to someone who has attempted to end their life in the way that he did. Research
shows that 19 out of 20 people who attempt suicide will fail. But the people who fail are
37 times more likely to succeed the second time. This truly is an at-risk population with
very few resources to support them. And what happens when people try to assemble
themselves back into life, because of our taboos around suicide, we're not sure what to
say, and so quite often we say nothing. And that furthers the isolation that people like
John found themselves in. I know John's story very well because I'm John. And this is,
today, the first time in any sort of public setting I've ever acknowledged the journey
that I have been on. But after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend
last year to suicide, and sitting last year at TEDActive, I knew that I needed to step out
of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading — and that is that
people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and
need our help. As the Trevor Project says, it gets better.

It gets way better. And I'm choosing to come out of a totally different kind of closet
today to encourage you, to urge you, that if you are someone who has contemplated or
attempted suicide, or you know somebody who has, talk about it; get help. It's a
conversation worth having and an idea worth spreading. Thank you.
