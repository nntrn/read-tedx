title: A historical musical that examines black identity in the 1901 World's Fair
speaker: Amma Y. Ghartey-Tagoe Kootin
description: >-
 In this lively talk and performance, artist and TED Fellow Amma Y. Ghartey-Tagoe
 Kootin offers a sneak peek of her forthcoming musical "At Buffalo." Drawing on
 archival material from the 1901 Pan-American Exhibition, a world's fair held in
 Buffalo, New York, the show examines conflicting representations of black
 identity exhibited at the fair -- highlighting unsettlingly familiar parallels
 between American society at the turn of the century and today, and asking: Are we
 all still part of the show?

The archive. One may envision rooms and shelves stocked with boxes and cartons of old
stuff. And yet, for those who are patient enough to dig through it, the archive provides
the precious opportunity to touch the past, to feel and learn from the experiences of
once-living people who now seem dead and buried deeply in the archive. But what if there
was a way to bring the archive to life? Jon Michael Reese: "The world is thinking wrong
about race."Melissa Joyner: "This country insists upon judging the Negro."JMR: "Because it
does not know."AYGTK: What if one could make it breathe? MJ: "By his lowest and most
vicious representatives."AYGTK: Speak. JMR: "An honest, straightforward exhibit."AYGTK: And
even sing to us, so that the archive becomes accessible to everyone. What would performing
the archive look like? A performance that is not simply based on a true story but one that
allows us to come face-to-face with things we thought were once dead and buried.(Piano
music)This is what "At Buffalo," a new musical we're developing, is all about. Using
collections from over 30 archival institutions, "At Buffalo" performs the massive archive
of the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, the first World's Fair of the 20th century, held in
Buffalo, New York.

Now, if you've heard of this fair, it might be because this is where then-US president,
William McKinley, was assassinated. For nearly 17 years, I've stayed inside the gates and
the archive of this fair, not only because of that story but because of a real
life-and-death racial drama that played out on the fairgrounds. Here, in a place that was
like Disney World, the Olympics, carnivals, museums, all in one, there were three
conflicting displays of what it meant to be black in the United States. The archive says
white showmen presented a savage black origin in the form of 98 West and Central Africans,
living and performing war dances in a recreated village called Darkest Africa. And across
the street, a happy slave life, in the form of 150 Southern black performers, picking
cotton, singing and dancing minstrel shows in a recreated antebellum attraction called Old
Plantation. As a response, the black Buffalo community championed the third display of
blackness: the Negro Exhibit.

Codesigned by African American scholar W.E.B. Du Bois, it curated photographs, charts,
books and more, to show black Americans as a high-achieving race, capable of education and
progress. When I first encountered this story, I understood from my own life experience
what was at stake to have members of the African diaspora see each other like this. For
me, as the child of immigrant parents from Ghana, West Africa, born in the American South,
raised in Manhattan, Kansas,

and having attended the same elite school as Du Bois, I could see that the Buffalo fair
effectively pitted the black Northerner against the Southerner, the educated against the
uneducated, and the African American against the African. And I wanted to know: How did
these three distinct groups of black folk navigate this experience? Unfortunately, the
archive had answers to questions like this underneath racial caricature, conflicting
information and worse — silence.(Piano music)Still, I could hear musical melodies and see
dance numbers and the rhythms of the words coming off the pages of old newspaper articles.
And learning that this World's Fair had music playing everywhere on its fairgrounds, I
knew that live, immersive, spectacular musical theater, with the latest technologies of
our time, is the closest experience that can bring the archival story of the 1901 fair out
of boxes and into life. Stories, like Tannie and Henrietta, a husband and wife vaudeville
duo in love who become at odds over performing these "coon" minstrel shows while striving
for their five-dollar-a-week dream in the Old Plantation attraction.

Like African businessman John Tevi, from present-day Togo, who must outwit the savage
rules of the human zoo in which he has become trapped. And stories like Mary Talbert, a
wealthy leader of the black Buffalo elite, who must come to terms with the racial
realities of her home town. MJ: "The dominant race in this country insists upon judging the
Negro by his lowest and most vicious representatives."AYGTK: Like Old Plantation and
Darkest Africa. MJ: "... instead of by the more intelligent and worthy classes."AYGTK: When
fair directors ignored Mary Talbert and the local black Buffalo community's request to
participate in the fair, newspapers say that Mary Talbert and her club of educated African
American women held a rousing protest meeting. But the details of that meeting, even down
to the fiery speech she gave, were not fully captured in the archive. So, "At Buffalo"
takes the essence of Mary's speech and turns it into song.(All singing) We must, we are
unanimous.

We must, we are unanimous. MJ: We've got something to show — we're going to teach a lesson
in Buffalo. It would benefit the nation to see our growth since emancipation. Colored
people should be represented in this Pan-American exposition, it would benefit the nation
to see our growth since emancipation.(All singing) They made a great mistake not to
appoint someone from the race. We must, we are unanimous. We must, we are unanimous. We
must, we are unanimous. AYGTK: Mary Talbert successfully demands that the Negro Exhibit
come to the fair. And to have the Negro Exhibit in Buffalo means that the musical must
tell the story behind why Du Bois cocreated it ... and why Mary and the black elite felt
it was urgently needed. JMR: "The world is thinking wrong about race. They killed Sam Hose
for who they thought he was. And more men like him, every day, more Negro men, like him,
taken apart. And after that — that red ray ...

we can never be the same.

A red ray[A man hunt in Georgia]cut across my desk[Mob after Hose; he will be lynched if
caught]the very day Sam's hands were laid to rest. Can words alone withstand the laws
unjust?[Escape seems impossible]Can words alone withstand the violence? Oh, no, oh.[Burned
alive][Sam Hose is lynched]Oh, no, oh.[His body cut in many pieces]Oh, no, oh.[Burned at
the Stake][Ten Cents Slice Cooked Liver.][Fight for souvenirs.](Both singing) Who has read
the books? Our numbers and statistics look small against the page. The crisis has
multiplied. Our people are lynched and died. Oh, Lord. Something must change. AYGTK:
Something must change. "At Buffalo" reveals how the United States today stands at similar
crossroads as 1901 America. Just as the name of Sam Hose filled newspapers back then,
today's media carries the names of:JMR: Oscar Grant. MJ: Jacqueline Culp. Pianist: Trayvon
Martin. AYGTK: Sandra Bland. And too many others.

The 1901 fair's legacies persist in more ways than we can imagine. MJ: Mary Talbert and the
National Association of Colored Women started movements against lynching and the myth of
black criminality just as black women today started Black Lives Matter. JMR: And some of
the same people who fought for and created the Negro Exhibit, including Du Bois, came to
Buffalo, four years after the fair, to start the Niagara Movement, which set the
groundwork for the creation of the NAACP.AYGTK: It's not just black folks who had a
peculiar experience at the 1901 fair. An official handbook informed fair-goers:MJ: "Please
remember:"JMR: "... once you get inside the gate,"AYGTK: "... you are a part of the show."
Performing the archive in "At Buffalo" allows audiences to ask themselves, "Are we still
inside the gates, and are we all still part of the show?"(Music ends)(Applause and
cheers)
