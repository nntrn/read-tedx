title: A love story for the coral reef crisis
speaker: Ayana Elizabeth Johnson
description: >-
 Over the course of hundreds of scuba dives, marine biologist Ayana Elizabeth
 Johnson fell in love -- with a fish. In this ode to parrotfish, she shares five
 reasons why these creatures are simply amazing (from their ability to poop white
 sand to make colorful "wardrobe changes") and shows what's at stake -- for us and
 them -- as climate change threatens the future of coral reefs.

I want to tell you a love story. But it doesn't have a happy ending. Once upon a time, I
was a stubborn five-year-old who decided to become a marine biologist. Thirty-four years,
400 scuba dives and one PhD later, I'm still completely enamored with the ocean. I spent a
decade working with fishing communities in the Caribbean, counting fish, interviewing
fishermen, redesigning fishing gear and developing policy. I've been helping to figure out
what sustainable management can look like for places where food security, jobs and
cultures all depend on the sea. In the midst of all this, I fell in love. With a fish.
There are over 500 fish species that live on Caribbean reefs, but the ones I just can't
get out of my head are parrotfish. Parrotfish live on coral reefs all over the world,
there are 100 species, they can grow well over a meter long and weigh over 20 kilograms,
but that's the boring stuff.

I want to tell you five incredible things about these fish. First, they have a mouth like a
parrot's beak, which is strong enough to bite coral, although mostly they're after algae.
They are the lawn mowers of the reef. This is key, because many reefs are overgrown with
algae due to nutrient pollution from sewage and fertilizer that runs off of land. And
there just aren't enough herbivores like parrotfish left out on the reefs to mow it all
down. OK, second amazing thing. After all that eating, they poop fine white sand. A single
parrotfish can produce over 380 kilograms of this pulverized coral each year. Sometimes,
when scuba diving, I would look up from my clipboard and just see contrails of parrotfish
poop raining down. So next time you're lounging on a tropical white-sand beach, maybe
thank of parrotfish.

Third, they have so much style. Mottled and striped, teal, magenta, yellow, orange,
polka-dotted, parrotfish are a big part of what makes coral reefs so colorful. Plus, in
true diva style, they have multiple wardrobe changes throughout their life. A juvenile
outfit, an intermediate getup, and a terminal look. Fourth, with this last wardrobe change
comes a sex change from female to male, termed sequential hermaphroditism. These large
males then gather harems of females to spawn. Heterosexual monogamy is certainly not
nature's status quo. And parrotfish exemplify some of the beauty of diverse reproductive
strategies. Fifth, and the most incredible, sometimes when parrotfish cozy up into a nook
in the reef at night, they secrete a mucus bubble from a gland in their head that envelops
their entire body. This masks their scent from predators and protects them from parasites,
so they can sleep soundly.

I mean, how cool is this?

So this is a confession of my love for parrotfish in all their flamboyant, algae-eating,
sand-pooping, sex-changing glory.

But with this love comes heartache. Now that groupers and snappers are woefully
overfished, fishermen are targeting parrotfish. Spearfishing took out the large species,
midnight blue and rainbow parrotfish are now exceedingly rare, and nets and traps are
scooping up the smaller species. As both a marine biologist and a single person, I can
tell you, there aren't that many fish in the sea.

And then, there's my love for their home, the coral reef, which was once as vibrant as
Caribbean cultures, as colorful as the architecture, and as bustling as carnival. Because
of climate change, on top of overfishing and pollution, coral reefs may be gone within 30
years. An entire ecosystem erased. This is devastating, because hundreds of millions of
people around the world depend on reefs for their nutrition and income. Let that sink in. A
little bit of good news is that places like Belize, Barbuda and Bonaire are protecting
these VIPs â€” Very Important Parrotfish. Also, more and more places are establishing
protected areas that protect the entire ecosystem. These are critical efforts, but it's
not enough. As I stand here today, only 2.2 percent of the ocean is protected. Meanwhile,
90 percent of the large fish, and 80 percent of the coral on Caribbean reefs, is already
gone. We're in the midst of the sixth mass extinction. And we, humans, are causing it. We
also have the solutions.

Reverse climate change and overfishing, protect half the ocean and stop pollution running
from land. But these are massive undertakings requiring systemic changes, and we're really
taking our sweet time getting around to it. Each of us can contribute, though. With our
votes, our voices, our food choices, our skills and our dollars. We must overhaul both
corporate practices and government policies. We must transform culture. Building community
around solutions is the most important thing. I am never going to give up working to
protect and restore this magnificent planet. Every bit of habitat we preserve, every tenth
of a degree of warming we prevent, really does matter. Thankfully, I'm not motivated by
hope, but rather a desire to be useful. Because I don't know how to give an honest talk
about my beloved parrotfish and coral reefs that has a happy ending. Thank
you.
