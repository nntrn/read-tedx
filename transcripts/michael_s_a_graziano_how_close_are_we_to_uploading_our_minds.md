Imagine a future where nobody dies— instead, our minds are uploaded to a digital world.
They might live on in a realistic, simulated environment with avatar bodies, and could
still call in and contribute to the biological world. Mind uploading has powerful appeal—
but what would it actually take to scan a person’s brain and upload their mind? The main
challenges are scanning a brain in enough detail to capture the mind and perfectly
recreating that detail artificially. But first, we have to know what to scan. The human
brain contains about 86 billion neurons, connected by at least a hundred trillion
synapses. The pattern of connectivity among the brain’s neurons, that is, all of the
neurons and all their connections to each other, is called the connectome. We haven’t yet
mapped the connectome, and there’s also a lot more to neural signaling. There are
hundreds, possibly thousands of different kinds of connections, or synapses. Each
functions in a slightly different way.

Some work faster, some slower. Some grow or shrink rapidly in the process of learning;
some are more stable over time. And beyond the trillions of precise, 1-to-1 connections
between neurons, some neurons also spray out neurotransmitters that affect many other
neurons at once. All of these different kinds of interactions would need to be mapped in
order to copy a person’s mind. There are also a lot of influences on neural signaling
that are poorly understood or undiscovered. To name just one example, patterns of
activity between neurons are likely influenced by a type of cell called glia. Glia
surround neurons and, according to some scientists, may even outnumber them by as many
as ten to one. Glia were once thought to be purely for structural support, and their
functions are still poorly understood, but at least some of them can generate their own
signals that influence information processing. Our understanding of the brain isn’t good 
enough to determine what we’d need to scan in order to replicate the mind, but assuming
our knowledge does advance to that point, how would we scan it?

Currently, we can accurately scan a living human brain with resolutions of about half a 
millimeter using our best non-invasive scanning method, MRI. To detect a synapse, we’ll
need to scan at a resolution of about a micron— a thousandth of a millimeter. To
distinguish the kind of synapse and precisely how strong each synapse is, we’ll need even
better resolution. MRI depends on powerful magnetic fields. Scanning at the resolution
required to determine the details of individual synapses would requires a field strength
high enough to cook a person’s tissues. So this kind of leap in resolution would require
fundamentally new scanning technology. It would be more feasible to scan a dead brain
using an electron microscope, but even that technology is nowhere near good enough– and
requires killing the subject first. Assuming we eventually understand the brain well
enough to know what to scan and develop the technology to safely scan at that resolution,
the next challenge would be to recreate that information digitally.

The main obstacles to doing so are computing power and storage space, both of which are
improving every year. We’re actually much closer to attaining this technological capacity
than we are to understanding or scanning our own minds. Artificial neural networks
already run our internet search engines, digital assistants, self-driving cars, Wall
Street trading algorithms, and smart phones. Nobody has yet built an artificial network
with 86 billion neurons, but as computing technology improves, it may be possible to keep
track of such massive data sets. At every step in the scanning and uploading process,
we’d have to be certain we were capturing all the necessary information accurately— or
there’s no telling what ruined version of a mind might emerge. While mind uploading is 
theoretically possible, we’re likely hundreds of years away from the technology and
scientific understanding that would make it a reality.

And that reality would come with ethical and philosophical considerations: who would have
access to mind uploading? What rights would be accorded to uploaded minds? How could this
technology be abused? Even if we can eventually upload our minds, whether we should
remains an open question.
