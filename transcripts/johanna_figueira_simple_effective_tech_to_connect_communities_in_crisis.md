title: Simple, effective tech to connect communities in crisis
speaker: Johanna Figueira
description: >-
 The world is more connected than ever, but some communities are still cut off
 from vital resources like electricity and health care. In this solution-oriented
 talk, activist Johanna Figueira discusses her work with Code for Venezuela -- a
 platform that gathers technologists to address Venezuela's needs for information
 and medical supplies -- and shares ideas for how it could be used as a model to
 help other communities in need.

I'm an immigrant from Venezuela, and I've lived in the US for six years. If you ask me
about my life as an expatriate, I would say that I've been lucky. But it hasn't been
easy. Growing up, I never thought that I was going to leave my homeland. I participated in
my first student protest in 2007, when the president shut down one of the most important
news networks. I was getting my bachelor's degree in communications, and that was the
first time I realized I couldn't take free speech for granted. We knew things were getting
bad, but we never saw what was coming: an economic crisis, infrastructure breaking down,
citywide electrical blackouts, the decline of public health care and shortage of
medicines, disease outbreaks and starvation. I moved to Canada with my husband in 2013,
and we always thought we'd move back home when the crisis improved. But we never did.
Nearly all my childhood friends have left the country, but my parents are still
there.

There have been moments where I've called my mom, and I could hear people screaming and
crying in the background as teargas bombs exploded in the streets. And my mom, as if I
couldn't hear it, would always tell me,(Speaking Spanish)"We're fine, don't worry." But of
course, I worry. It's my parents, and I'm 4,000 miles away. Today, I'm just one of more
than four million Venezuelans who have left their home country. A lot of my friends are
Venezuelan immigrants, and in the last few years, we've begun talking about how we could
make a difference when we live so far away. That is how Code for Venezuela was born in
2019.It began with a hackathon, because we are experts in tech, and we thought we could
use our tech skills to create solutions for people on the ground. But first, we needed to
find some experts actually living inside Venezuela to guide us. We'd see so many other
hackathons that came up with wily, ambitious, incredible technological solutions that
sounded great in theory but ultimately failed to work in the actual countries they were
intended to help.

Many of us have been living abroad for years, and we are detached from the day-to-day
problems that people are facing in Venezuela. So we turned to the experts actually living
inside of the country. For example, Julio Castro, a doctor and one of the leaders of
Médicos por la Salud. When the government stopped publishing official health care data in
2015, Dr. Julio began collecting information himself, using an informal but coordinated
system of cell phone communications. They track available personnel, medical supplies,
mortality data, disease outbreaks; compile it into a report; and then share that on
Twitter. He became our go-to expert on health care in Venezuela. Luis Carlos Díaz, a widely
recognized journalist who reports acts of censorship and human rights violations suffered
by the people of Venezuela, he helps us make sense of what is happening there, since the
news is controlled by the government. We call these people our heroes on the
ground.

With their expert advice, we came up with a series of challenges for hackathon
participants. In that first hackathon, we had 300 participants from seven countries come
up with 16 different project submissions. We picked the projects with the most potential
and continued working on them after the event. Today, I'll share two of our most
successful projects to give you a taste of the impact we are having so far. They're called
MediTweet and Blackout Tracker. MediTweet is an intelligent Twitter bot that helps
Venezuelans find the medicine they need. Right now in Venezuela, if you get sick and you
go to a hospital, there is a good chance they won't have the right medical supplies to
treat you. The situation is so bad that patients often get a "shopping list" from the
doctor instead of a prescription. I live the need for this firsthand. My mom was diagnosed
with cancer in 2015. She needed to have a lumbar puncture to get a final diagnosis and
treatment plan.

But the needle for this procedure wasn't available. I was in Venezuela at that time, and I
was seeing my mom getting worse in front of me every day. After looking everywhere, we
found the needle in a site that is like the eBay of Latin America. I met the seller in a
local bakery, and it was like buying something on the black market. My mom brought the
needle to her doctor, and he did the procedure. Without this, she could have died. But it's
not just medical supplies, it's medicines, too. When she was first diagnosed, we bought
her treatment in a state pharmacy, and it was, like, practically free. But then the state
pharmacy ran out, and we still had six months of treatment ahead. Six months of treatment
ahead. We bought some medicines online and the rest in Mexico. Now she's in her third year
of remission, and every time that I call, she tells me, "I'm fine, don't worry."But not
everyone can afford to leave the country, and many aren't healthy enough to
travel.

That is why people turn to Twitter, buying and selling medicines using the hashtag
#ServicioPublico, meaning "public service." Our Twitter bot scans Twitter for the hashtag
#ServicioPublico and connects users who are asking for specific medicines with those who
are selling their private leftovers. We also pool the location data of those Twitter users
and use it for a visualization tool. It gives local organizations like Médicos por la
Salud a sense of where they have a shortage. We can also apply machine learning algorithms
to detect clusters of disease. If they've received humanitarian aid, this could help them
to make better decisions about the distributions of the supplies. Our second project, is
called Blackout Tracker. Venezuela is currently going through an electricity crisis. Last
year, Venezuela suffered what some people consider the worst power failures in Venezuelan
history. I had two long days without communication with my parents. Some cities
experienced blackouts every day.

But you only know about this on social media. The government won't report blackouts on the
news. When the power goes out, many Venezuelans, we quickly tweet out the location with
the hashtag #SinLuz, meaning "without electricity," before their phones ran out of
battery, so people around the country know what is happening. Like MediTweet, Blackout
Tracker scans Twitter for the hashtag #SinLuz and creates a map using the location data of
those users. You can quickly see where the blackouts are happening today and how many
blackouts have happened over time. People want to know what is happening, and this is our
answer. But it's also a way of holding the government accountable. It's easy for them to
deny that the problem exists or make excuses, because there is no official data on it.
Blackout Tracker shows how bad the problem really is. Now, some people in Silicon Valley
may look at these projects and say that there are no major technological innovations. But
that is the point.

These projects are not insanely advanced, but it's what the people of Venezuela need, and
they can have a tremendous impact. Beyond these projects, perhaps our most significant
accomplishment is that a movement has been created, one where people around the world are
coming together to use their professional skills to create solutions for the people of
Venezuela. And because we are partnering with locals, we are creating the solutions that
people want and need. What is so great about this is that we are using our professional
skills, so it comes easily and naturally. It's not that hard for us to make a difference.
If someone from San Francisco were to hire professionals to create solutions like
MediTweet or Blackout Tracker, it would cost a small fortune. By donating our services, we
are making a bigger impact than if we were just to donate money. And you can do the same
thing — not in Venezuela, necessarily, but in your own community.

In a world that is more connected than ever, we still see how specialized communities can
be living isolated or in silos. There are so many great ways to help, but I believe that
you can use your professional skills to connect diverse communities and create effective
solutions through those relationships. Anyone with knowledge and professional skills has a
powerful force to bring hope to a community. For us at Code for Venezuela, this is just
the beginning. Thank you.
