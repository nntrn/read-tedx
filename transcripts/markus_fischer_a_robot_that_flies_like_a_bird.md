title: A robot that flies like a bird
speaker: Markus Fischer
description: >-
 Plenty of robots can fly -- but none can fly like a real bird. That is, until
 Markus Fischer and his team at Festo built SmartBird, a large, lightweight robot,
 modeled on a seagull, that flies by flapping its wings. A soaring demo fresh from
 TEDGlobal 2011.

It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird. Birds are very agile. They fly, not with
rotating components, so they fly only by flapping their wings. So we looked at the birds,
and we tried to make a model that is powerful, ultralight, and it must have excellent
aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings. So what
would be better than to use the herring gull, in its freedom, circling and swooping over
the sea, and to use this as a role model? So we bring a team together. There are
generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics, in the field of building
gliders. And the task was to build an ultralight indoor-flying model that is able to fly
over your heads. So be careful later on.

And this was one issue: to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell
down. So why do we do all this? We are a company in the field of automation, and we'd like
to do very lightweight structures because that's energy efficient, and we'd like to learn
more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena. So I now would like you to put your seat
belts on and put your hats on. So maybe we'll try it once — to fly a SmartBird. Thank
you.

(Applause ends)

So we can now look at the SmartBird. So here is one without a skin. We have a wingspan of
about two meters. The length is one meter and six, and the weight is only 450 grams. And
it is all out of carbon fiber. In the middle we have a motor, and we also have a gear in
it, and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor. So within the motor, we
have three Hall sensors, so we know exactly where the wing is. And if we now beat up and
down —(Mechanical sounds)We have the possibility to fly like a bird. So if you go down,
you have the large area of propulsion, and if you go up, the wings are not that large, and
it is easier to get up. So, the next thing we did, or the challenges we did, was to
coordinate this movement. We have to turn it, go up and go down. We have a split wing.
With the split wing, we get the lift at the upper wing, and we get the propulsion at the
lower wing. Also, we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency.

We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the
aerodynamic efficiency. So therefore, it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion,
from 30 percent up to 80 percent. Next thing we have to do, we have to control and regulate
the whole structure. Only if you control and regulate it, you will get that aerodynamic
efficiency. So the overall consumption of energy is about 25 watts at takeoff and 16 to 18
watts in flight. Thank you.

Bruno Giussani: Markus, we should fly it once more. Markus Fischer: Yeah,
sure.

Yeah!
