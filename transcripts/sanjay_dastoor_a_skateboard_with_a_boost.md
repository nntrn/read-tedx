title: A skateboard, with a boost
speaker: Sanjay Dastoor
description: >-
 Imagine an electric vehicle that can get you to work -- or anywhere in a six-mile
 radius -- quickly, without traffic frustrations or gasoline. Now imagine you can
 pick it up and carry it with you. Yes, this souped-up skateboard could change the
 face of morning commutes.

Today I'm going to show you an electric vehicle that weighs less than a bicycle, that you
can carry with you anywhere, that you can charge off a normal wall outlet in 15 minutes,
and you can run it for 1,000 kilometers on about a dollar of electricity. But when I say
the word electric vehicle, people think about vehicles. They think about cars and
motorcycles and bicycles, and the vehicles that you use every day. But if you come about
it from a different perspective, you can create some more interesting, more novel
concepts. So we built something. I've got some of the pieces in my pocket here. So this is
the motor. This motor has enough power to take you up the hills of San Francisco at about
20 miles per hour, about 30 kilometers an hour, and this battery, this battery right here
has about six miles of range, or 10 kilometers, which is enough to cover about half of the
car trips in the U.S. alone. But the best part about these components is that we bought
them at a toy store.

These are from remote control airplanes. And the performance of these things has gotten so
good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently, you can really change
things. So today we're going to show you one example of how you can use this. Pay attention
to not only how fun this thing is, but also how the portability that comes with this can
totally change the way you interact with a city like San Francisco.

[6 Mile Range] [Top Speed Near 20mph] [Uphill Climbing] [Regenerative Braking]

So we're going to show you what this thing can do. It's really maneuverable. You have a
hand-held remote, so you can pretty easily control acceleration, braking, go in reverse if
you like, also have braking. It's incredible just how light this thing is. I mean, this is
something you can pick up and carry with you anywhere you go. So I'll leave you with one of
the most compelling facts about this technology and these kinds of vehicles. This uses 20
times less energy for every mile or kilometer that you travel than a car, which means not
only is this thing fast to charge and really cheap to build, but it also reduces the
footprint of your energy use in terms of your transportation. So instead of looking at
large amounts of energy needed for each person in this room to get around in a city, now
you can look at much smaller amounts and more sustainable transportation. So next time you
think about a vehicle, I hope, like us, you're thinking about something new. Thank
you.
