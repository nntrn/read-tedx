I went down to St. James InfirmaryTo see my baby thereShe was lying on a long wooden
tableSo cold, so still, so fairI went up to see the doctor" She's very low," he saidI went
back to see my babyGood God she's lying there deadI went down to old Joe's bar roomOn the
corner of the squareThey were serving drinks as per usualAnd the usual crowd was thereTo
my left stood Old Joe McKennedyHis eyes were bloodshot redHe turned to the crowd around
himAnd these are the words he said" Let her go, let her go, God bless herWherever she may
beShe can search this whole wide world all overBut she'll never find another man like
meShe can search this whole wide world all overAnd she'll never find another man like
meWhen I die, please God, bury meIn my ten-dollar Stetson hatPut a twenty-dollar gold
piece on my watch chainSo my friends know I died standing patGet six gamblers to carry my
coffinAnd six choir girls to sing me a songStick a jazz band on my hearse wagonTo raise
hell as I go alongNow that's the end of my storyLet's have another round of boozeAnd if
anyone should ask youJust tell them I got the St.

James Infirmary blues
