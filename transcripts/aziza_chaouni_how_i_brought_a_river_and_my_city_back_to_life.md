title: How I brought a river, and my city, back to life
speaker: Aziza Chaouni
description: >-
 The Fez River winds through the medina of Fez, Moroccoâ€”a mazelike medieval city
 that's a World Heritage site. Once considered the "soul" of this celebrated city,
 the river succumbed to sewage and pollution, and in the 1950s was covered over
 bit by bit until nothing remained. TED Fellow Aziza Chaouni recounts her 20 year
 effort to restore this river to its former glory, and to transform her city in
 the process.

I would like to share with you today a project that has changed how I approach and
practice architecture: the Fez River Rehabilitation Project. My hometown of Fez, Morocco,
boasts one of the largest walled medieval cities in the world, called the medina, nestled
in a river valley. The entire city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since the 1950s, as
the population of the medina grew, basic urban infrastructure such as green open spaces
and sewage quickly changed and got highly stressed. One of the biggest casualties of the
situation was the Fez River, which bisects the medina in its middle and has been
considered for many centuries as the city's very soul. In fact, one can witness the
presence of the river's extensive water network all throughout the city, in places such as
private and public fountains. Unfortunately, because of the pollution of the river, it has
been covered little by little by concrete slabs since 1952.

This process of erasure was coupled with the destruction of many houses along the river
banks to be able to make machineries enter the narrow pedestrian network of the medina.
Those urban voids quickly became illegal parking or trash yards. Actually, the state of
the river before entering the medina is pretty healthy. Then pollution takes its toll,
mainly due to untreated sewage and chemical dumping from crafts such as tanning. At some
point, I couldn't bear the desecration of the river, such an important part of my city,
and I decided to take action, especially after I heard that the city received a grant to
divert sewage water and to treat it. With clean water, suddenly the uncovering of the river
became possible, and with luck and actually a lot of pushing, my partner Takako Tajima and
I were commissioned by the city to work with a team of engineers to uncover the river.
However, we were sneaky, and we proposed more: to convert riverbanks into pedestrian
pathways, and then to connect these pathways back to the city fabric, and finally to
convert the urban voids along the riverbanks into public spaces that are lacking in the
Medina of Fez.

I will show you briefly now two of these public spaces. The first one is the Rcif Plaza,
which sits actually right on top of the river, which you can see here in dotted lines.
This plaza used to be a chaotic transportation hub that actually compromised the urban
integrity of the medina, that has the largest pedestrian network in the world. And right
beyond the historic bridge that you can see here, right next to the plaza, you can see
that the river looked like a river of trash. Instead, what we proposed is to make the
plaza entirely pedestrian, to cover it with recycled leather canopies, and to connect it
to the banks of the river. The second site of intervention is also an urban void along the
river banks, and it used to be an illegal parking, and we proposed to transform it into
the first playground in the medina. The playground is constructed using recycled tires and
also is coupled with a constructed wetland that not only cleans the water of the river but
also retains it when floods occur. As the project progressed and received several design
awards, new stakeholders intervened and changed the project goals and design.

The only way for us to be able to bring the main goals of the project ahead was for us to
do something very unusual that usually architects don't do. It was for us to take our
design ego and our sense of authorship and put it in the backseat and to focus mainly on
being activists and on trying to coalesce all of the agendas of stakeholders and focus on
the main goals of the project: that is, to uncover the river, treat its water, and provide
public spaces for all. We were actually very lucky, and many of those goals happened or
are in the process of happening. Like, you can see here in the Rcif Plaza. This is how it
looked like about six years ago. This is how it looks like today. It's still under
construction, but actually it is heavily used by the local population. And finally, this
is how the Rcif Plaza will look like when the project is completed. This is the river,
covered, used as a trash yard. Then after many years of work, the river with clean water,
uncovered.

And finally, you can see here the river when the project will be completed. So for sure,
the Fez River Rehabilitation will keep on changing and adapting to the sociopolitical
landscape of the city, but we strongly believe that by reimagining the role and the agency
of the architect, we have set up the core idea of the project into motion; that is, to
transform the river from sewage to public space for all, thereby making sure that the city
of Fez will remain a living city for its inhabitants rather than a mummified
heritage. Thank you very much.
