 undergo two major changes which explore that range. So how exactly does our voice

In the mid-16th century, Italians were captivated by a type of male singer whose
incredible range contained notes previously thought impossible for adult men. However,
this gift came at a high price. To prevent their voices from breaking, these singers had
been castrated before puberty, halting the hormonal processes that would deepen their
voices. Known as castrati, their light, angelic voices were renowned throughout Europe,
until the cruel procedure that created them was outlawed in the 1800s. Though stunting
vocal growth can produce an extraordinary musical range, naturally developing voices are
already capable of incredible variety. And as we age, our bodies undergo two major changes
which explore that range. So how exactly does our voice box work, and what causes these
shifts in speech? The specific sound of a speaking voice is the result of many anatomical
variables, but it’s mostly determined by the age and health of our vocal cords and the
size of our larynxes.

The larynx is a complex system of muscle and cartilage that supports and moves the vocal
cords, or, as they’re more accurately known, the vocal folds. Strung between the thyroid 
and arytenoid cartilages, these two muscles form an elastic curtain that opens and shuts
across the trachea, the tube that carries air through the throat. The folds are apart
when we’re breathing, but when we speak, they slam shut. Our lungs push air against the
closed folds, blowing them open and vibrating the tissue to produce sound. Unlike the
deliberate focus required for playing an external instrument, we effortlessly change
notes as we speak. By pushing air faster or slower, we change the frequency and amplitude 
of these vibrations, which respectively translate to the pitch and volume of our voices.
Rapid and small vibrations create high-pitched, quiet tones, while slow, large vibrations
 produce deep, bellowing rumbles.

Finally, by moving the laryngeal muscles between the cartilages, we can stretch and
contract those folds to intuitively play our internal instruments. This process is the
same from your first words to your last, but as you age, your larynx ages too. During
puberty, the first major shift starts, as your voice begins to deepen. This happens when 
your larynx grows in size, elongating the vocal folds and opening up more room for them to
vibrate. These longer folds have slower, larger vibrations, which result in a lower
baseline pitch. This growth is especially dramatic in many males, whose high testosterone
levels lead first to voice cracks, and then to deeper, more booming voices, and laryngeal
protrusions called Adam’s apples. Another vocal development during puberty occurs when the
homogenous tissue covering the folds specializes into three distinct functional layers: a
central muscle, a layer of stiff collagen wrapped in stretchy elastin fibers, and an
outer layer of mucus membrane.

These layers add nuance and depth to the voice, giving it a distinct timbre that sets it 
apart from its pre-pubescent tones. After puberty, most people’s voices remain more or less
the same for about 50 years. But we all use our voices differently, and eventually we
experience the symptoms associated with aging larynxes, known as presbyphonia. First, the
collagen in our folds stiffens and the surrounding elastin fibers atrophy and decay. This
decreased flexibility increases the pitch of older voices. But for people who have
experienced the hormonal effects of menopause, the higher pitch is countered and
outweighed by swollen vocal folds. The folds' increased mass slows their vibrations,
resulting in deeper voices. All these symptoms are further complicated by having fewer
healthy laryngeal nerve endings, which reduces precise muscle control and causes breathy
or rough voices. Ultimately, these anatomical changes are just a few of the factors that
can affect your voice.

But when kept in good condition, your voice box is a finely tuned instrument, capable of
operatic arias, moody monologues, and stirring speeches.
