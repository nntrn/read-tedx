description: >-
 In a talk that could change how you see things, designer and artist Jiabao Li
 introduces her conceptual projects that expose the inherent bias of digital
 media. From a helmet that makes you "allergic" to the color red to a browser
 plug-in that filters the internet in an unexpected way, Li's creations uncover
 how technology mediates the way we perceive reality.

I'm an artist and an engineer. And lately, I've been thinking a lot about how technology
mediates the way we perceive reality. And it's being done in a superinvisible and nuanced
way. Technology is designed to shape our sense of reality by masking itself as the actual
experience of the world. As a result, we are becoming unconscious and unaware that it is
happening at all. Take the glasses I usually wear, for example. These have become part of
the way I ordinarily experience my surroundings. I barely notice them, even though they
are constantly framing reality for me. The technology I am talking about is designed to do
the same thing: change what we see and think but go unnoticed. Now, the only time I do
notice my glasses is when something happens to draw my attention to it, like when it gets
dirty or my prescription changes. So I asked myself, "As an artist, what can I create to
draw the same kind of attention to the ways digital media — like news organizations,
social media platforms, advertising and search engines — are shaping our reality?" So I
created a series of perceptual machines to help us defamiliarize and question the ways we
see the world. For example, nowadays, many of us have this kind of allergic reaction to
ideas that are different from ours.

We may not even realize that we've developed this kind of mental allergy. So I created a
helmet that creates this artificial allergy to the color red. It simulates this
hypersensitivity by making red things look bigger when you are wearing it. It has two
modes: nocebo and placebo. In nocebo mode, it creates this sensorial experience of
hyperallergy. Whenever I see red, the red expands. It's similar to social media's
amplification effect, like when you look at something that bothers you, you tend to stick
with like-minded people and exchange messages and memes, and you become even more angry.
Sometimes, a trivial discussion gets amplified and blown way out of proportion. Maybe
that's even why we are living in the politics of anger. In placebo mode, it's an
artificial cure for this allergy. Whenever you see red, the red shrinks. It's a
palliative, like in digital media. When you encounter people with different opinions, we
will unfollow them, remove them completely out of our feeds.

It cures this allergy by avoiding it. But this way of intentionally ignoring opposing
ideas makes human community hyperfragmented and separated. The device inside the helmet
reshapes reality and projects into our eyes through a set of lenses to create an augmented
reality. I picked the color red, because it's intense and emotional, it has high
visibility and it's political. So what if we take a look at the last American presidential
election map through the helmet?

You can see that it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican, because the
mediation alters our perceptions. The allergy exists on both sides. In digital media, what
we see every day is often mediated, but it's also very nuanced. If we are not aware of
this, we will keep being vulnerable to many kinds of mental allergies. Our perception is
not only part of our identities, but in digital media, it's also a part of the value
chain. Our visual field is packed with so much information that our perception has become
a commodity with real estate value. Designs are used to exploit our unconscious biases,
algorithms favor content that reaffirms our opinions, so that every little corner of our
field of view is being colonized to sell ads. Like, when this little red dot comes out in
your notifications, it grows and expands, and to your mind, it's huge. So I started to
think of ways to put a little dirt, or change the lenses of my glasses, and came up with
another project.

Now, keep in mind this is conceptual. It's not a real product. It's a web browser plug-in
that could help us to notice the things that we would usually ignore. Like the helmet, the
plug-in reshapes reality, but this time, directly into the digital media itself. It shouts
out the hidden filtered voices. What you should be noticing now will be bigger and
vibrant, like here, this story about gender bias emerging from the sea of
cats.

The plug-in could dilute the things that are being amplified by an algorithm. Like, here
in this comment section, there are lots of people shouting about the same opinions. The
plug-in makes their comments super small.

So now the amount of pixel presence they have on the screen is proportional to the actual
value they are contributing to the conversation.

The plug-in also shows the real estate value of our visual field and how much of our
perception is being commoditized. Different from ad blockers, for every ad you see on the
web page, it shows the amount of money you should be earning.

We are living in a battlefield between reality and commercial distributed reality, so the
next version of the plug-in could strike away that commercial reality and show you things
as they really are.

Well, you can imagine how many directions this could really go. Believe me, I know the
risks are high if this were to become a real product. And I created this with good
intentions to train our perception and eliminate biases. But the same approach could be
used with bad intentions, like forcing citizens to install a plug-in like that to control
the public narrative. It's challenging to make it fair and personal without it just
becoming another layer of mediation. So what does all this mean for us? Even though
technology is creating this isolation, we could use it to make the world connected again
by breaking the existing model and going beyond it. By exploring how we interface with
these technologies, we could step out of our habitual, almost machine-like behavior and
finally find common ground between each other. Technology is never neutral. It provides a
context and frames reality. It's part of the problem and part of the solution.

We could use it to uncover our blind spots and retrain our perception and consequently,
choose how we see each other. Thank you.
