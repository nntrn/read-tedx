 "Copy editing for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop for a Major League
 Baseball team -- every little movement gets picked over by the critics," says
 Mary Norris, who has played the position for more than thirty years. In that
 time, she's gotten a reputation for sternness and for being a "comma maniac," but
 this is unfounded, she says. Above all, her work is aimed at one thing: making
 authors look good. Explore The New Yorker's distinctive style with the person who
 knows it best in this charming talk.

I have spent the past 38 years trying to be invisible. I'm a copy editor. I work at The
New Yorker, and copyediting for The New Yorker is like playing shortstop for a Major
League Baseball team: every little movement gets picked over by the critics — God forbid
you should commit an error. Just to clarify: copy editors don't choose what goes into the
magazine. We work at the level of the sentence, maybe the paragraph, the words, the
punctuation. Our business is in the details. We put the diaeresis, the double dot, over
the "i" in "naïve." We impose house style. Every publication has a house style. The New
Yorker's is particularly distinctive. We sometimes get teased for our style. Imagine — we
still spell "teen-ager" with a hyphen, as if that word had just been coined. But you see
that hyphen in "teen-age" and that diaeresis over "coöperate," and you know you're reading
The New Yorker. Copyediting at The New Yorker is a mechanical process.

There is a related role called query proofreading, or page-OK'ing. Whereas copyediting is
mechanical, query proofreading is interpretive. We make suggestions to the author through
the editor to improve the emphasis of a sentence or point out unintentional repetitions
and supply compelling alternatives. Our purpose is to make the author look good. Note that
we give our proofs not directly to the author, but to the editor. This often creates a
good cop/bad cop dynamic in which the copy editor — I'll use that as an umbrella term — is
invariably the bad cop. If we do our job well, we're invisible, but as soon as we make a
mistake, we copy editors become glaringly visible. Here is the most recent mistake that
was laid at my door.[Last Tuesday, Sarah Palin, the pre-Trump embodiment of populist
no-nothingism in the Republican Party, endorsed Trump.]"Where were The New Yorker's fabled
copy editors?" a reader wrote. "Didn't the writer mean 'know-nothingism'?"Ouch.

There's no excuse for this mistake. But I like it: "no-nothingism." It might be American
vernacular for "nihilism."

Here, another reader quotes a passage from the magazine:[Ruby was seventy-six, but she
retained her authoritative bearing; only her unsteady gait belied her age.]He added:
"Surely, someone at The New Yorker knows the meaning of 'belied,' and that it is the
opposite of how it is used in this sentence. Come on! Get it together."Belie: to give a
false impression. It should have been "betrayed."E.B. White once wrote of commas in The
New Yorker: "They fall with the precision of knives outlining a body."

And it's true — we get a lot of complaints about commas. "Are there really two commas in
'Martin Luther King, Jr., Boulevard'?" There may not be on the sign, but yes, that is New
Yorker style for "Jr." One wag wrote:["Please, could you expel, or, at least, restrain,
the comma-maniac, on your editorial staff?"]

Ah, well. In this case, those commas are well-placed, except that there should not be one
between "maniac" and "on."

Also, if we must have commas around "at least," we might change it up by using dashes
around that phrase: "... — or, at least, restrain —" Perfect.

Then there's this: "Love you, love your magazine, but can you please stop writing massive
numbers as text?"[two and a half million ...]No.

One last cri de coeur from a spelling stickler:["Those long stringy things are vocal
cords, not chords."]The outraged reader added, "I'm sure I'm not the first to write
regarding this egregious proofreading error, but I'm equally sure I won't be the last.
Fie!"

I used to like getting mail. There is a pact between writers and editors. The editor never
sells out the writer, never goes public about bad jokes that had to be cut or stories that
went on too long. A great editor saves a writer from her excesses. Copy editors, too, have
a code; we don't advertise our oversights. I feel disloyal divulging them here, so let's
have look at what we do right. Somehow, I've gotten a reputation for sternness. But I work
with writers who know how to have their way with me. I've known Ian Frazier, or "Sandy,"
since the early 80s. And he's one of my favorites, even though he sometimes writes a
sentence that gives a copy editor pause. Here is one from a story about Staten Island
after Hurricane Sandy:[A dock that had been broken in the middle and lost its other half
sloped down toward the water, its support pipes and wires leaning forward like when you
open a box of linguine and it slides out.]

This would never have got past the grammarian in the days of yore. But what could I do?
Technically, the "like" should be an "as," but it sounds ridiculous, as if the author were
about to embark on an extended Homeric simile — "as when you open a box of
linguine."

I decided that the hurricane conferred poetic justice on Sandy and let the sentence
stand.

Generally, if I think something is wrong, I query it three times. I told Sandy that not
long ago in a moment of indiscretion and he said,"Only three?"So, he has learned to hold
out. Recently, he wrote a story for "Talk of the Town," that's the section at the front of
the magazine with short pieces on subjects ranging from Ricky Jay's exhibit at the
Metropolitan Museum to the introduction of doggie bags in France. Sandy's story was about
the return to the Bronx of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. There were three things
in it that I had to challenge. First, a grammar query. The justice was wearing black and
Sandy wrote,[Her face and hands stood out like in an old, mostly dark painting.]Now,
unlike with the hurricane, with this "like," the author didn't have the excuse of
describing hurricane damage. "Like" in this sense is a preposition, and a preposition
takes an object, which is a noun. This "like" had to be an "as." "As in an old, mostly
dark painting."Second, a spelling issue.

The author was quoting someone who was assisting the justice:["It will be just a minute.
We are getting the justice mic'ed,"]Mic'ed? The music industry spells it "mic" because
that's how it's spelled on the equipment. I'd never seen it used as a verb with this
spelling, and I was distraught to think that "mic'ed" would get into the magazine on my
watch.

New Yorker style for "microphone" in its abbreviated form is "mike."Finally, there was a
sticky grammar and usage issue in which the pronoun has to have the same grammatical
number as its antecedent.[everyone in the vicinity held their breath]"Their" is plural and
"everyone," its antecedent, is singular. You would never say, "Everyone were there."
Everyone was there. Everyone is here. But people say things like, "Everyone held their
breath" all the time. To give it legitimacy, copy editors call it "the singular 'their,'"
as if calling it singular makes it no longer plural.

It is my job when I see it in print to do my best to eliminate it. I couldn't make it,
"Everyone held her breath," or "Everyone held his breath," or "Everyone held his or her
breath." Whatever I suggested had to blend in. I asked, through the editor, if the author
would consider changing it to "All in the vicinity held their breath," because "all" is
plural. Nope. I tried again: "All those present held their breath?" I thought this sounded
vaguely judicial. But the editor pointed out that we could not have "present" and
"presence" in the same sentence. When the final proof came back, the author had accepted
"as" for "like," and "miked" for "mic'ed." But on "Everyone held their breath," he stood
his ground. Two out of three isn't bad. In the same issue, in that piece on doggie bags in
France, there was the gratuitous use of the f-word by a Frenchman. I wonder, when the mail
comes in, which will have offended the readers more.

Thank you.
