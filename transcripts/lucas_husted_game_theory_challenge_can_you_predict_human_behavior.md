title: Game theory challenge: Can you predict human behavior?
speaker: Lucas Husted
description: >-
 Given a range of integers from 0 to 100, what would the whole number closest to
 2/3 of the average of all numbers guessed be? For example, if the average of all
 guesses is 60, the correct guess will be 40. The game is played under conditions
 known to game theorists as "common knowledge:" every player has the same
 information— they also know that everyone else does too. Lucas Husted explains.

A few months ago we posed a challenge to our community. We asked everyone: given a range
of integers from 0 to 100, guess the whole number closest to 2/3 of the average of all
numbers guessed. So if the average of all guesses is 60, the correct guess will be 40.
What number do you think was the correct guess at 2/3 of the average? Let’s see if we can
try and reason our way to the answer. This game is played under conditions known to game
theorists as common knowledge. Not only does every player have the same information —
they also know that everyone else does, and that everyone else knows that everyone else
does, and so on, infinitely. Now, the highest possible average would occur if every
person guessed 100. In that case, 2/3 of the average would be 66.66. Since everyone can
figure this out, it wouldn’t make sense to guess anything higher than 67.If everyone
playing comes to this same conclusion, no one will guess higher than 67.

Now 67 is the new highest possible average, so no reasonable guess should be higher than
⅔ of that, which is 44. This logic can be extended further and further. With each step,
the highest possible logical answer keeps getting smaller. So it would seem sensible to
guess the lowest number possible. And indeed, if everyone chose zero, the game would reach
what’s known as a Nash Equilibrium. This is a state where every player has chosen the
best possible strategy for themselves given everyone else playing, and no individual
player can benefit by choosing differently. But, that’s not what happens in the real
world. People, as it turns out, either aren’t perfectly rational, or don’t expect each
other to be perfectly rational. Or, perhaps, it’s some combination of the two. When this
game is played in real-world settings, the average tends to be somewhere between 20 and
35. Danish newspaper Politiken ran the game with over 19,000 readers participating,
resulting in an average of roughly 22, making the correct answer 14.

For our audience, the average was 31.3. So if you guessed 21 as 2/3 of the average, well
done. Economic game theorists have a way of modeling this interplay between rationality
and practicality called k-level reasoning. K stands for the number of times a cycle of
reasoning is repeated. A person playing at k-level 0 would approach our game naively,
guessing a number at random without thinking about the other players. At k-level 1, a
player would assume everyone else was playing at level 0, resulting in an average of 50, 
and thus guess 33. At k-level 2, they’d assume that everyone else was playing at level 1,
leading them to guess 22. It would take 12 k-levels to reach 0.The evidence suggests that
most people stop at 1 or 2 k-levels. And that’s useful to know, because k-level thinking
comes into play in high-stakes situations. For example, stock traders evaluate stocks not
only based on earnings reports, but also on the value that others place on those
numbers.

And during penalty kicks in soccer, both the shooter and the goalie decide whether to go
right or left based on what they think the other person is thinking. Goalies often
memorize the patterns of their opponents ahead of time, but penalty shooters know that 
and can plan accordingly. In each case, participants must weigh their own understanding
of the best course of action against how well they think other participants understand
the situation. But 1 or 2 k-levels is by no means a hard and fast rule— simply being
conscious of this tendency can make people adjust their expectations. For instance, what
would happen if people played the 2/3 game after understanding the difference between the
most logical approach and the most common? Submit your own guess at what 2/3 of the new
average will be by using the form below, and we’ll find out.
