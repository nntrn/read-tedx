I want to tell you all about a piece of American history that is so secret, that nobody
has done anything about it for 167 years, until right now. And the way that we're going to
uncover this vestigial organ of America past is by asking this question: Why? As we all
know — 

we are in the middle of another presidential election, hotly contested, as you can see.

But what you may not know is that American voter turnout ranks near the bottom of all
countries in the entire world, 138th of 172 nations. This is the world's most famous
democracy. So ... Why do we vote on Tuesday? Does anybody know? And as a matter of fact,
Michigan and Arizona are voting today. Here's the answer: Absolutely no good reason
whatsoever. 

I'm not joking. You will not find the answer in the Declaration of Independence, nor will
you find it in the Constitution. It is just a stupid law from 1845. 

In 1845, Americans traveled by horse and buggy. As did I, evidently. It took a day to get
to the county seat to vote, a day to get back, and you couldn't travel on the Sabbath, so,
Tuesday it was. I don't often travel by horse and buggy, I would imagine most of you
don't, so when I found out about this, I was fascinated. I linked up with a group called,
what else — "Why Tuesday?" to go and ask our nation's most prominent elected leaders if
they knew the answer to the question, "Why do we vote on Tuesday?" 

Rick Santorum: Anybody knows? OK, I'm going to be stumped on this. Anybody knows why we
vote on Tuesdays? Jacob Soboroff: Do you happen to know? Ron Paul: On Tuesdays? JS: The
day after the first Monday in November. RP: I don't know how that originated. JS: Do you
know why we do vote on Tuesday? Newt Gingrich: No. Dick Lugar: No, I don't.

Dianne Feinstein: I don't. Darrell Issa: No. John Kerry: In truth, really, I'm not sure
why. JS: OK, thanks very much. 

JS: These are people that live for election day, yet they don't know why we vote on that
very day. 

Chris Rock said, "They don't want you to vote. If they did, we wouldn't vote on a Tuesday
in November. Have you ever thrown a party on a Tuesday? 

No, of course not. Nobody would show up." 

Here's the cool part. Because we asked this question, "Why Tuesday?" there is now this
bill, the Weekend Voting Act in the Congress of the United States of America. It would
move election day from Tuesday to the weekend, so that — duh — more people can vote.

It has only taken 167 years, but finally, we are on the verge of changing American
history. Thank you very much. 

Thanks a lot.
