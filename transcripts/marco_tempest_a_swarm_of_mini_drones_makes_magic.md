So, I have a background in technology and magic. And magicians are interesting. Their
illusions accomplish what technology cannot. But what happens when the technology of the
day seems almost magical? What happens when you can do this?

Now, 100 years ago, that would have been the magic of levitation. Is it possible to create
illusions in a world where technology makes anything possible? Jump!Now, if you know how
the trick is done, where is the illusion? But still, our imagination is more powerful than
our reasoning, and it's easy to attribute personality to machines. These are quadcopters.
But they are more than mechanical flying machines. They analyze the environment around
them and react to everything I do. At once, algorithms allow these autonomous machines to
fly in close formation, aware of each other and aware of me â€” mathematics that can be
mistaken for intelligence, and intelligence for personality. Anthropomorphism: that's the
illusion, an illusion created by technology and embroidered by our imagination to become
an intelligent flying robot, a machine that appears to be alive.(Music plays "Close
Encounters of the Third Kind")(Quadcopters make tones)I think they say, "Hello." Hey guys!
Come on.

And time to land. And that's it. Thank you.

OK, guys, time to go home. Everybody in here. Come on, everybody, quickly, quickly. No
pushing, everybody can fit. There you go, a little bit to the left, a little bit to the
right. Come on, everybody, everybody, and ... good job!

Thank you.

Thank you.
