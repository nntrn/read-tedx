 If Yoda goes into cardiac arrest, will you know what to do? Artist and first-aid
 enthusiast Todd Scott breaks down what you need to know about using an automated
 external defibrillator, or AED -- in this galaxy and ones that are far, far away.
 Prepare to save the life of a Jedi, Chewbacca (he'll need a quick shave first) or
 someone else in need with some helpful pointers.

Last year, I got a chance to watch the new "Star Wars" movie, which was fantastic, but one
thing kept bugging me. I don't know if you noticed this or not. In this entirely
technically advanced world, I did not see a single AED anywhere, which was totally
shocking — almost as shocking as not knowing what an AED is, which you guys do know. But
for those at home, an AED is an automated external defibrillator. It's the device you use
when your heart goes into cardiac arrest to shock it back into a normal rhythm, or, as one
of the guys I was teaching a class to referred to it as: "The shocky-hearty-box
thing."

But I really can't blame the Empire, since health and safety regulations aren't really
their first order of business. Though, even if we — I think worse than not having an AED
would be if there was one there, but just, no one knew where to find it. These devices can
drastically increase your chance of survival — almost like a tauntaun on
Hoth.

But I'm pretty sure that stormtrooper is going to be toast, regardless if we have an AED
or not, since what happens is the chest plate is going to be quite hard to get off, and
like that tauntaun, the AED has a very short window of time at which it's highly
effective. In this case — basically, we've got to use it within the first 10 minutes. The
Jedi, on the other hand, have no problems with their outfits. Those robes open straight
up, you can place the pads right onto the chest — so upper-right-hand side of the chest,
lower left, wait for the unit to determine if it's a shockable rhythm and get ready to
shock. But, the Jedi do have a problem. They have a head appendage issue. And so I can be
totally clear, thinking I'm ready to go, but I'm accidentally touching a tentacle and
inadvertently shocking myself.

So before you hit that button, make sure you are clear and everyone else is clear. Going
back to that stormtrooper: If I did get that chest plate off in time, what would you do if
you suddenly found there was a Wookiee under there, or possibly two Ewoks?

Well, lucky for us, in the kit there's actually a razor, and we can use that to shave the
chest on the upper right-hand side and the lower left. Wookiees also have another problem.
They have an accessory issue. What we want to do is remove these — anything between the
two pads we want to remove, since it can cause something called "arcing." For those who
don't know what arcing is, do you remember the Emperor, when he shoots electricity out the
ends of his fingers —

that would be kind of like arcing. Another thing that — Oh! By the way, he creates that by
wearing wool socks under his robes.

We can also get arcing if we have an extremely wet chest. The electricity travels across
the surface instead of through the heart. We can correct this with the immortal words of
Douglas Adams: "Don't panic," which most of us have done today — and also always having a
towel. So, good words to go by. The metal bikini — unfortunately, this is where panic sets
in — like the modern bra, we have to make sure we remove, because this can cause severe
arcing along with burns. But unfortunately this opens up an issue that's almost as
controversial as talking about the prequels.

The mere mention of the word "nipples," and people get into a little bit of a tizzy. By
the way, that is not a nipple, that's a cupcake.

Chances are, if you do have to use this, this is going to be on someone you know. And
remember, everyone has nipples, except for Jabba.

But he does love cupcakes. Speaking about Jabba, if we do have to use an AED on him,
remember pad placement is the same, even though he doesn't have nipples. So it's going to
be upper right-hand side, lower left. If we were going through, we're shocking, getting
ready to go — after we've done the shock, one of the things we need to do is remember to
do compression. The preferred method is 30 compressions and two breaths in the center of
the chest, between the nipples, pressing down at least two inches, no more than two and a
half, at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute, no more than 120. Unfortunately, due to
the size of Jabba's mouth and also what he puts in said mouth, we may not want to actually
do the mouth-to-mouth part. So instead, we can do compression-only CPR. The way of
remembering the compression-only part is we can actually use the Imperial March. I would
sing it for you —

Unfortunately, that would be more something an interrogation droid would do. Yoda. Small
little guy, like a baby. What we do is basically treat him like a baby, in the sense that
we're going to place one pad in the center of the chest and one in the back. If we place
them both in the front, they can be too close and cause severe arcing, so we want to avoid
that. Hopefully, this helped to clarify and put some light on some of the darker issues of
using an AED in the Star Wars universe, or any universe in total. I'll leave you with one
point. Remember, if you do find yourself dealing with a Wookiee, do not shave the entire
Wookiee. This takes way too much time, and it only pisses them off.

Thank you very much.
