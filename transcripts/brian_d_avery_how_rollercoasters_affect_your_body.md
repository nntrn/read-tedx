In the summer of 1895, crowds flooded the Coney Island boardwalk to see the latest marvel
 of roller coaster technology: the Flip Flap Railway. This was America’s first-ever
looping coaster – but its thrilling flip came at a price. The ride caused numerous cases
of severe whiplash, neck injury and even ejections, all due to its signature loop. Today,
coasters can pull off far more exciting tricks, without resorting to the “thrill” of a
hospital visit. But what exactly are roller coasters doing to your body, and how have
they managed to get scarier and safer at the same time? At the center of every roller
coaster design is gravity. Unlike cars or transit trains, most coasters are propelled
around their tracks almost entirely by gravitational energy. After the coaster crests the
initial lift hill, it begins an expertly engineered cycle – building potential energy on
ascents and expending kinetic energy on descents.

This rhythm repeats throughout the ride, acting out the coaster engineer’s choreographed
dance of gravitational energy. But there’s a key variable in this cycle that wasn’t always
so carefully considered: you. In the days of the Flip-Flap, ride designers were most
concerned with coasters getting stuck somewhere along the track. This led early builders
to overcompensate, hurling trains down hills and pulling on the brakes when they reached
the station. But as gravity affects the cars, it also affects the passengers. And under
the intense conditions of a coaster, gravity’s effects are multiplied. There’s a common
unit used by jet pilots, astronauts, and coaster designers called “g force”. One G force
is the familiar tug of gravity you feel when standing on Earth – this is the force of
Earth’s gravitational pull on our bodies. But as riders accelerate and decelerate, they
experience more or less gravitational force.

Modern ride designers know that the body can handle up to roughly 5 Gs, but the Flip-Flap
and its contemporaries routinely reached up to 12 Gs. At those levels of gravitational
pressure, blood is sent flying from your brain to your feet, leading to light-headedness
or blackouts as the brain struggles to stay conscious. And oxygen deprivation in the
retinal cells impairs their ability to process light, causing greyed out vision or
temporary blindness. If the riders are upside down, blood can flood the skull, causing a
bout of crimson vision called a “redout”.Conversely, negative G’s create weightlessness.
Within the body, short-term weightlessness is mostly harmless. It can contribute to a
rider’s motion sickness by suspending the fluid in their inner ears which coordinates
balance. But the bigger potential danger – and thrill – comes from what ride designers 
call airtime. This is when riders typically experience seat separation, and, without the
proper precautions, ejection.

The numerous belts and harnesses of modern coasters have largely solved this issue, but
the passenger’s ever-changing position can make it difficult to determine what needs to be
 strapped down. Fortunately, modern ride designers are well aware of what your body, and
the coaster, can handle. Coaster engineers play these competing forces against each
other, to relieve periods of intense pressure with periods of no pressure at all. And
since a quick transition from positive to negative G-force can result in whiplash,
headaches, and back and neck pain, they avoid the extreme changes in speed and direction
so common in thrill rides of old. Modern rides are also much sturdier, closely considering
the amount of gravity they need to withstand. At 5 G’s, your body feels 5 times heavier;
so if you weigh 100lbs, you’d exert the weight of 500 lbs on the coaster. Engineers have
to account for the multiplied weight of every passenger when designing a coaster’s
supports. Still, these rides aren’t for everyone.

The floods of adrenaline, light-headedness, and motion sickness aren’t going anywhere
soon. But today’s redundant restraints, 3D modeling and simulation software have made
roller coasters safer and more thrilling than ever. Our precise knowledge about the 
limits of the human body have helped us build coasters that are faster, taller, and
loopier – and all without going off the rails.
