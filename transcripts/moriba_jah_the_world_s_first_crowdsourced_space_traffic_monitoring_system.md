title: The world's first crowdsourced space traffic monitoring system
speaker: Moriba Jah
description: >-
 "Most of what we send into outer space never comes back," says astrodynamicist
 and TED Fellow Moriba Jah. In this forward-thinking talk, Jah describes the space
 highways orbiting earth and how they're mostly populated by space junk. Learn
 more about his quest to develop and scale the world's first crowdsourced space
 traffic monitoring system -- and how it could help solve the debris problem in
 near-earth space.

I am an astrodynamicist — you know, like that guy Rich Purnell in the movie "The Martian."
And it's my job to study and predict motion of objects in space. Currently we track about
one percent of hazardous objects on orbit — hazardous to services like location,
agriculture, banking, television and communications, and soon — very soon — even the
internet itself. Now these services are not protected from, roughly, half a million objects
the size of a speck of paint all the way to a school bus in size. A speck of paint,
traveling at the right speed, impacting one of these objects, could render it absolutely
useless. But we can't track things as small as a speck of paint. We can only track things
as small as say, a smartphone. So of this half million objects that we should be concerned
about, we can only track about 26,000 of these objects. And of these 26,000, only 2,000
actually work. Everything else is garbage.

That's a lot of garbage. To make things a little bit worse, most of what we launch into
orbit never comes back. We send the satellite in orbit, it stops working, it runs out of
fuel, and we send something else up ... and then we send up something else ... and then
something else. And every once in a while, two of these things will collide with each other
or one of these things will explode, or even worse, somebody might just happen to destroy
one of their satellites on orbit, and this generates many, many more pieces, most of which
also never come back. Now these things are not just randomly scattered in orbit. It turns
out that given the curvature of space-time, there are ideal locations where we put some of
these satellites — think of these as space highways. Very much like highways on earth,
these space highways can only take up a maximum capacity of traffic to sustain space-safe
operations. Unlike highways on earth, there are actually no space traffic rules. None
whatsoever, OK? Wow.

What could possibly go wrong with that?

Now, what would be really nice is if we had something like a space traffic map, like a
Waze for space that I could look up and see what the current traffic conditions are in
space, maybe even predict these. The problem with that, however, is that ask five
different people, "What's going on in orbit? Where are things going?" and you're probably
going to get 10 different answers. Why is that? It's because information about things on
orbit is not commonly shared either. So what if we had a globally accessible, open and
transparent space traffic information system that can inform the public of where
everything is located to try to keep space safe and sustainable? And what if the system
could be used to form evidence-based norms of behavior — these space traffic rules? So I
developed ASTRIAGraph, the world's first crowdsourced, space traffic monitoring system at
the University of Texas at Austin.

ASTRIAGraph combines multiple sources of information from around the globe — government,
industry and academia — and represents this in a common framework that anybody can access
today. Here, you can see 26,000 objects orbiting the earth, multiple opinions, and it gets
updated in near real time. But back to my problem of space traffic map: What if you only
had information from the US government? Well, in that case, that's what your space traffic
map would look like. But what do the Russians think? That looks significantly different.
Who's right? Who's wrong? What should I believe? What could I trust? This is part of the
issue. In the absence of this framework to monitor space-actor behavior, to monitor
activity in space — where these objects are located — to reconcile these inconsistencies
and make this knowledge commonplace, we actually risk losing the ability to use space for
humanity's benefit. Thank you very much.(Applause and cheers)
