title: Drawings that show the beauty and fragility of Earth
speaker: Zaria Forman
description: >-
 Zaria Forman's large-scale compositions of melting glaciers, icebergs floating in
 glassy water and waves cresting with foam explore moments of transition,
 turbulence and tranquility. Join her as she discusses the meditative process of
 artistic creation and the motivation behind her work. "My drawings celebrate the
 beauty of what we all stand to lose," she says. "I hope they can serve as records
 of sublime landscapes in flux."

I consider it my life's mission to convey the urgency of climate change through my work.
I've traveled north to the Arctic to the capture the unfolding story of polar melt, and
south to the Equator to document the subsequent rising seas. Most recently, I visited the
icy coast of Greenland and the low-lying islands of the Maldives, connecting two seemingly
disparate but equally endangered parts of our planet. My drawings explore moments of
transition, turbulence and tranquility in the landscape, allowing viewers to emotionally
connect with a place you might never have the chance to visit. I choose to convey the
beauty as opposed to the devastation. If you can experience the sublimity of these
landscapes, perhaps you'll be inspired to protect and preserve them. Behavioral psychology
tells us that we take action and make decisions based on our emotions above all else. And
studies have shown that art impacts our emotions more effectively than a scary news
report.

Experts predict ice-free Arctic summers as early as 2020. And sea levels are likely to
rise between two and ten feet by century's end. I have dedicated my career to illuminating
these projections with an accessible medium, one that moves us in a way that statistics
may not. My process begins with traveling to the places at the forefront of climate change.
On-site, I take thousands of photographs. Back in the studio, I work from both my memory
of the experience and the photographs to create very large-scale compositions, sometimes
over 10 feet wide. I draw with soft pastel, which is dry like charcoal, but colors. I
consider my work drawings but others call them painting. I cringe, though, when I'm
referred to as a "finger painter."

But I don't use any tools and I have always used my fingers and palms to manipulate the
pigment on the paper. Drawing is a form of meditation for me. It quiets my mind. I don't
perceive what I'm drawing as ice or water. Instead, the image is stripped down to its most
basic form of color and shape. Once the piece is complete, I can finally experience the
composition as a whole, as an iceberg floating through glassy water, or a wave cresting
with foam. On average, a piece this size takes me about, as you can see, 10
seconds.

Really, more like 200 hours, 250 hours for something that size. But I've been drawing ever
since I could hold a crayon, really. My mom was an artist, and growing up, we always had
art supplies all over the house. My mother's love of photography propelled her to the most
remote regions of the earth, and my family and I were fortunate enough to join and support
her on these adventures. We rode camels in Northern Africa and mushed on dog sleds near
the North Pole. In August of 2012, I led my first expedition, taking a group of artists and
scholars up the northwest coast of Greenland. My mother was originally supposed to lead
this trip. She and I were in the early stages of planning, as we had intended to go
together, when she fell victim to a brain tumor. The cancer quickly took over her body and
mind, and she passed away six months later. During the months of her illness, though, her
dedication to the expedition never wavered, and I made a promise to carry out her final
journey. My mother's passion for the Arctic echoed through my experience in Greenland, and
I felt the power and the fragility of the landscape.

The sheer size of the icebergs is humbling. The ice fields are alive with movement and
sound in a way that I never expected. I expanded the scale of my compositions to give you
that same sense of awe that I experienced. Yet, while the grandeur of the ice is evident,
so, too, is its vulnerability. From our boat, I could see the ice sweating under the
unseasonably warm sun. We had a chance to visit many of the Inuit communities in Greenland
that now face huge challenges. The locals spoke to me of vast areas of sea ice that are no
longer freezing over as they once did. And without ice, their hunting and harvesting
grounds are severely diminished, threatening their way of life and survival. The melting
glaciers in Greenland are one of the largest contributing factors to rising sea levels,
which have already begun to drown some of our world's lowest-lying islands. One year after
my trip to Greenland, I visited the Maldives, the lowest and flattest country in the
entire world.

While I was there, I collected images and inspiration for a new body of work: drawings of
waves lapping on the coast of a nation that could be entirely underwater within this
century. Devastating events happen every day on scales both global and personal. When I was
in Greenland, I scattered my mother's ashes amidst the melting ice. Now she remains a part
of the landscape she loved so much, even as it, too, passes and takes on new form. Among
the many gifts my mother gave me was the ability to focus on the positive, rather than the
negative. My drawings celebrate the beauty of what we all stand to lose. I hope they can
serve as records of sublime landscapes in flux, documenting the transition and inspiring
our global community to take action for the future. Thank you.
