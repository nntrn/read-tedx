title: A song inspired by the ocean
speaker: Jackson Browne
description: >-
 Jackson Browne plays a song about being on the ocean ... or really, being
 anywhere among passionate friends. (He started writing this song aboard Mission
 Blue Voyage, a Sylvia Earle-inspired conference about saving the ocean.) "If I
 could be anywhere," he sings, "anywhere right now, I would be here."

Thank you.

♫ Slide into the shimmering surface ♫ ♫ between two worlds. ♫ ♫ Standing at the center of
time ♫ ♫ as it uncurls. ♫ ♫ Cutting through the veil of illusion. ♫ ♫ Moving beyond past
conclusions. ♫ ♫ Wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear. ♫ ♫ If I could be
anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere right now, ♫ ♫ I would
want to be here. ♫ ♫ Searching for the future ♫ ♫ among the things we're throwing away. ♫
♫ Trying to see the world ♫ ♫ through the junk we produce everyday. ♫ ♫ They say nothing
lasts forever, ♫ ♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫ ♫ And no amount of
closing our eyes ♫ ♫ will make it disappear. ♫ ♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be
anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere in history, ♫ ♫ I would want to be here. ♫ ♫ The
Romans, the Spanish ♫ ♫ the British, the Dutch, ♫ ♫ American exceptionalism, so out of
touch. ♫ ♫ The folly of empire repeating its course, ♫ ♫ imposing its will ♫ ♫ and ruling
by force ♫ ♫ on and on through time.

♫ ♫ But the world can't take it very much longer. ♫ ♫ We're not going to make it ♫ ♫
unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫ ♫ The world is going to shake itself free of our
greed ♫ ♫ somehow. ♫ ♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere in time, ♫ ♫ if
I could be anywhere and change things, ♫ ♫ it would have to be now. ♫ ♫ They say nothing
last forever, ♫ ♫ but all the plastic ever made is still here. ♫ ♫ And no amount of
closing our eyes ♫ ♫ will make it disappear. ♫ ♫ And the world can't take it ♫ ♫ very much
longer. ♫ ♫ We're not going to make it ♫ ♫ unless we're smarter and stronger. ♫ ♫ The
world's gonna shake itself free of our greed ♫ ♫ somehow. ♫ ♫ And the world can't take it,
that you can see. ♫ ♫ If the oceans don't make it, neither will we. ♫ ♫ The world's gonna
shake itself all the way free ♫ ♫ somehow. ♫ ♫ If I could be anywhere, ♫ ♫ if I could be
anywhere in time, ♫ ♫ if I could be anywhere and change the outcome, ♫ ♫ it would have to
be now.

♫

Thank you.
