A friend called me a few weeks ago with bad news. She dropped her cell phone into the
toilet. Anyone here done that before?

So it was a bad situation. You know, without getting into the details of exactly how that
happened or how she got it out, let's just say it was a bad situation. And she panicked
because, like for many of us, her phone is one of the most used and essential tools in her
life. But, on the other hand, she had no idea how to fix it, because it's a completely
mysterious black box. So think about it: what would you do? What do you really understand
about how your phone works? What are you willing to test or fix? For most people, the
answer is, nothing. In fact, one survey found that almost 80 percent of smartphone users
in this country have never even replaced their phone batteries, and 25 percent didn't even
know this was possible. Now, I'm an experimental physicist, hence the toys. I specialize in
making new types of nanoscale electronic devices to study their fundamental quantum
mechanical properties.

But even I wouldn't know where to start in terms of testing elements on my phone if it
broke. And phones are just one example of the many devices that we depend upon but can't
test, take apart, or even fully understand. Cars, electronics, even toys are now so
complicated and advanced that we're scared to open and fix them. So here's the problem:
there's a disconnect between us and the technology that we use. We're completely alienated
from the devices that we most depend upon, which can make us feel helpless and empty. In
fact, it's not surprising then that one study found that we are now more afraid of
technology than we are of death.

But I think that we can reconnect to our devices, rehumanize them in a sense, by doing
more hands-on experiments. Why? Well, because an experiment is a procedure to test a
hypothesis, demonstrate a fact. It's the way that we use our senses, our hands, to connect
the world and figure out how it works. And that's the connection that we're missing. So let
me give you an example. Here's an experiment that I did recently to think about how a
touchscreen works. It's just two metal plates, and I can put charge on one of the plates
from a battery. OK. And I can measure the charge separation with this voltmeter here. Now
— let's make sure it's working. So when I wave my hand near the plates, you can see that
the voltage changes just like the touchscreen responds to my hand. But what is it about my
hand? Now I need to do more experiments. So I can, say, take a piece of wood and touch one
of the plates and see that not much happens, but if I take a piece of metal and touch the
plate, then the voltage changes dramatically.

So now I can do further experiments to see what the difference is between the wood and the
metal, and I should find out that the wood is not conducting but the metal is conducting
like my hand. And, you see, I build up my understanding. Like, now I can see why I can't
use a touchscreen with gloves, because gloves aren't conducting. But I've also broken down
some of the mystery behind the technology and built up my agency, my personal input and
interactions with the basis of my devices. But experimenting is a step beyond just taking
things apart. It's testing and doing hands-on critical thinking. And it doesn't really
matter whether I'm testing how a touchscreen works or if I'm measuring how conducting
different types of materials are, or even if I'm just using my hands to see how hard it is
to break different thicknesses of materials. In all cases, I'm gaining control and
understanding of the basis of the things that I use. And there's research behind
this.

For one, I'm using my hands, which seem to promote well-being. I'm also engaging in
hands-on learning, which has been shown to improve understanding and retention, and even
activate more parts of your brain. So hands-on thinking through experiments connects our
understanding, even our sense of vitality, to the physical world and the things that we
use. Looking things up on the internet does not have the same effect. Now, for me this
focus on experiments is also personal. I didn't grow up doing experiments. I didn't know
what a physicist did. I remember my sister had a chemistry set that I always wanted to use
but she never let me touch. I felt mentally disconnected from the world and didn't know
why. In fact, when I was nine years old, my grandmother called me a solipsist, which is
something I had to look up. It means that you think that yourself is all that exists. And
at the time I was pretty offended, because whose grandmother calls them
that?

But I think that it was true. And it wasn't until years later, when I was in college and
studying basic physics, that I had a revelation that the world, at least the physical
world, could be tested and understood, that I started to gain a completely different sense
of how the world worked and what my place was in it. And then later, when I was able my
own testing and understanding through research, a big part of my connection to the world
was complete. Now, I know that not everyone is an experimental physicist by profession, but
I think that everyone could be doing more hands-on experiments. And actually I think we
sort of — I'll give you another example. I was recently working with some middle school
students, helping them learn about magnetism, and I gave them a Magna Doodle to take
apart. Remember one of these things? So at first, none of them wanted to touch it. They'd
been told for so long not to break things that they're accustomed to just passive
using.

But then I started asking them questions. You know, how does it work? What parts are
magnetic? Can you make a hypothesis and test it? But they still didn't want to break it
open. They wanted to take it home with them, really. Until, one kid finally sliced it
through and found really cool stuff inside. And so this is something we can do here
together. They're pretty easy to take apart. See, there's a magnet inside, and I can just
cut this open. Cut it open again, you can split it. OK, so when I do that — I don't know
if you can see this, but there is sort of — there it is, this oozy white stuff in here.
Now you can see it on my finger. And when I drag the pen on it, you can see that these
filaments are attached to it. So the kids saw this, and at this point they're like, this
is really cool. They got excited. They all started ripping them open and taking them apart
and yelling out the things that they discovered, how these magnetic filaments connected to
the magnetic pen and that's how it wrote.

Or, how the oozy white stuff kept things dispersed so it could write. And as they were
leaving the room, two of them turned to me and said, "We loved that. Me and her are going
home this weekend to do more experiments."

Yeah, I know, the parents in there are worried about it, but it's a good thing!
Experimenting is good, and actually I found it extremely gratifying, and I think hopefully
it was very life-enriching for them. Because, even a basic magnet is something that we can
experiment with at home. They're both simple and complex at the same time. For example,
you can ask yourself, how can the same material both attract and repel? If I take a
magnet, is it useful if I can get one of them to rotate the other, for example? Or, you
can take this dollar bill over here, and I can take a set of magnets, and you can see that
the dollar bill gets lifted by the magnets. There's magnetic ink hidden in here that
prevents counterfeiting. Or, here I have some crushed-up bran cereal. OK? And that's also
magnetic. Right? That has iron in it.

And that can be good for you, right? OK, here's something else. This thing over here is
not magnetic. I can't lift it up with the magnet. But now I'm going to make it cold. The
same thing in here, cold, and when I make it cold, and put it on top of the magnet, so
—

It's amazing. That's not magnetic, but somehow it's interacting with a magnet. So clearly
understanding this is going to take many more experiments. In fact, this is something that
I've spent much of my career studying. It's called a superconductor. Now, superconductors
can be complex, but even simple experiments can connect us better to the world. So now if
I tell you that flash memory works by rotating small magnets, then you can imagine it.
You've seen it. Or, if I say that MRI machines use magnetism to rotate magnetic particles
in your body, you've seen it done. You've interacted with the technology and understood
the basis of these devices. Now, I know that it's hard to add more things to our lives,
especially experiments. But I think that the challenge is worth it. Think about how
something works, then take it apart to test it. Manipulate something and prove some
physical principle to yourself. Put the human back in the technology.

You'll be surprised at the connections that you make. Thank you.
