Raise your hand if you've ever been asked the question "What do you want to be when you
grow up?"Now if you had to guess, how old would you say you were when you were first asked
this question? You can just hold up fingers. Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK. Now,
raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?" has ever caused
you any anxiety.

Any anxiety at all. I'm someone who's never been able to answer the question "What do you
want to be when you grow up?"See, the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests —
it's that I had too many. In high school, I liked English and math and art and I built
websites and I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator. Maybe
you've heard of us.

This continued after high school, and at a certain point, I began to notice this pattern
in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would dive in, become
all-consumed, and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was, and then I would hit this
point where I'd start to get bored. And usually I would try and persist anyway, because I
had already devoted so much time and energy and sometimes money into this field. But
eventually this sense of boredom, this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this, this isn't
challenging anymore — it would get to be too much. And I would have to let it go. But then
I would become interested in something else, something totally unrelated, and I would dive
into that, and become all-consumed, and I'd be like, "Yes! I found my thing," and then I
would hit this point again where I'd start to get bored. And eventually, I would let it
go. But then I would discover something new and totally different, and I would dive into
that. This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.

The first was that I wasn't sure how I was going to turn any of this into a career. I
thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing, deny all of my other passions, and
just resign myself to being bored. The other reason it caused me so much anxiety was a
little bit more personal. I worried that there was something wrong with this, and
something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything. I worried that I was
afraid of commitment, or that I was scattered, or that I was self-sabotaging, afraid of my
own success. If you can relate to my story and to these feelings, I'd like you to ask
yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then. Ask yourself where you
learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal to doing many things. I'll tell you
where you learned it: you learned it from the culture. We are first asked the question
"What do you want to be when you grow up?" when we're about five years
old.

And the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that
age.

It's considered an innocuous question, posed to little kids to elicit cute replies, like,
"I want to be an astronaut," or "I want to be a ballerina," or "I want to be a pirate."
Insert Halloween costume here.

But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms — for
instance, high school students might get asked what major they're going to pick in
college. And at some point, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" goes from being the
cute exercise it once was to the thing that keeps us up at night. Why? See, while this
question inspires kids to dream about what they could be, it does not inspire them to
dream about all that they could be. In fact, it does just the opposite, because when
someone asks you what you want to be, you can't reply with 20 different things, though
well-meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like, "Oh, how cute, but you can't be a
violin maker and a psychologist. You have to choose."This is Dr. Bob Childs
—

and he's a luthier and psychotherapist. And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor turned
illustrator, entrepreneur, teacher and creative director. But most kids don't hear about
people like this. All they hear is that they're going to have to choose. But it's more
than that. The notion of the narrowly focused life is highly romanticized in our culture.
It's this idea of destiny or the one true calling, the idea that we each have one great
thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth, and you need to figure out what
that thing is and devote your life to it. But what if you're someone who isn't wired this
way? What if there are a lot of different subjects that you're curious about, and many
different things you want to do? Well, there is no room for someone like you in this
framework. And so you might feel alone. You might feel like you don't have a purpose. And
you might feel like there's something wrong with you. There's nothing wrong with
you.

What you are is a multipotentialite.

A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits. It's a mouthful
to say. It might help if you break it up into three parts: multi, potential, and ite. You
can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea, such as polymath, the
Renaissance person. Actually, during the Renaissance period, it was considered the ideal
to be well-versed in multiple disciplines. Barbara Sher refers to us as "scanners." Use
whichever term you like, or invent your own. I have to say I find it sort of fitting that
as a community, we cannot agree on a single identity.

It's easy to see your multipotentiality as a limitation or an affliction that you need to
overcome. But what I've learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas
on my website, is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way. Here are
three multipotentialite super powers. One: idea synthesis. That is, combining two or more
fields and creating something new at the intersection. Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from
their shared interests in cartography, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design,
when they founded Meshu. Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically-inspired
jewelry. Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea not despite, but because of their
eclectic mix of skills and experiences. Innovation happens at the intersections. That's
where the new ideas come from. And multipotentialites, with all of their backgrounds, are
able to access a lot of these points of intersection. The second multipotentialite
superpower is rapid learning.

When multipotentialites become interested in something, we go hard. We observe everything
we can get our hands on. We're also used to being beginners, because we've been beginners
so many times in the past, and this means that we're less afraid of trying new things and
stepping out of our comfort zones. What's more, many skills are transferable across
disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue, so we're
rarely starting from scratch. Nora Dunn is a full-time traveler and freelance writer. As a
child concert pianist, she honed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory. Now,
she's the fastest typist she knows.

Before becoming a writer, Nora was a financial planner. She had to learn the finer
mechanics of sales when she was starting her practice, and this skill now helps her write
compelling pitches to editors. It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're
drawn to, even if you end up quitting. You might apply that knowledge in a different field
entirely, in a way that you couldn't have anticipated. The third multipotentialite
superpower is adaptability; that is, the ability to morph into whatever you need to be in
a given situation. Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director, sometimes a web designer,
sometimes a Kickstarter consultant, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James
Bond.

He's valuable because he does good work. He's even more valuable because he can take on
various roles, depending on his clients' needs. Fast Company magazine identified
adaptability as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive in the 21st
century. The economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably that it is the
individuals and organizations that can pivot in order to meet the needs of the market that
are really going to thrive. Idea synthesis, rapid learning and adaptability: three skills
that multipotentialites are very adept at, and three skills that they might lose if
pressured to narrow their focus. As a society, we have a vested interest in encouraging
multipotentialites to be themselves. We have a lot of complex, multidimensional problems
in the world right now, and we need creative, out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them. Now,
let's say that you are, in your heart, a specialist.

You came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon. Don't worry —
there's nothing wrong with you, either.

In fact, some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist and multipotentialite paired
together. The specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas, while the multipotentialite
brings a breadth of knowledge to the project. It's a beautiful partnership. But we should
all be designing lives and careers that are aligned with how we're wired. And sadly,
multipotentialites are largely being encouraged simply to be more like their specialist
peers. So with that said, if there is one thing you take away from this talk, I hope that
it is this: embrace your inner wiring, whatever that may be. If you're a specialist at
heart, then by all means, specialize. That is where you'll do your best work. But to the
multipotentialites in the room, including those of you who may have just realized in the
last 12 minutes that you are one —

to you I say: embrace your many passions. Follow your curiosity down those rabbit holes.
Explore your intersections. Embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier, more authentic
life. And perhaps more importantly — multipotentialites, the world needs us. Thank
you.
