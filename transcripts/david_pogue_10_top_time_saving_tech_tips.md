I've noticed something interesting about society and culture. Everything risky requires a
license. So, learning to drive, owning a gun, getting married. There's a certain
—

That's true in everything risky, except technology. For some reason, there's no standard
syllabus, there's no basic course. They just sort of give you your computer and then kick
you out of the nest. You're supposed to learn this stuff — how? Just by osmosis. Nobody
ever sits down and tells you, "This is how it works." So today I'm going to tell you ten
things that you thought everybody knew, but it turns out they don't. First of all, on the
web, if you want to scroll down, don't pick up the mouse and use the scroll bar. That's a
terrible waste of time. Do that only if you're paid by the hour. Instead, hit the space
bar. The space bar scrolls down one page. Hold down the Shift key to scroll back up again.
So, space bar to scroll down one page; works in every browser, in every kind of
computer. Also on the web, when you're filling in one of these forms like your addresses, I
assume you know that you can hit the Tab key to jump from box to box to
box.

But what about the pop-up menu where you put in your state? Don't open the pop-up menu.
That's a terrible waste of calories. Type the first letter of your state over and over and
over. So if you want Connecticut, go, C, C, C. If you want Texas, go T, T, and you jump
right to that thing without even opening the pop-up menu. Also on the web, when the text is
too small, what you do is hold down the Control key and hit plus, plus, plus. You make the
text larger with each tap. Works on every computer, every web browser, or minus, minus, to
get smaller again. If you're on the Mac, it might be Command instead. When you're typing on
your Blackberry, Android, iPhone, don't bother switching layouts to the punctuation layout
to hit the period and then a space, then try to capitalize the next letter. Just hit the
space bar twice. The phone puts the period, the space, and the capital for you. Go space,
space.

It is totally amazing. Also when it comes to cell phones, on all phones, if you want to
redial somebody that you've dialed before, all you have to do is hit the call button, and
it puts the last phone number into the box for you, and at that point you can hit call
again to actually dial it. No need to go to the recent calls list if you're trying to call
somebody just hit the call button again. Something that drives me crazy: When I call you
and leave a message on your voice mail, I hear you saying, "Leave a message," and then I
get these 15 seconds of freaking instructions, like we haven't had answering machines for
45 years!

I'm not bitter.

So it turns out there's a keyboard shortcut that lets you jump directly to the beep like
this. Phone: At the tone, please...

David Pogue: Unfortunately, the carriers didn't adopt the same keystroke, so it's
different by carrier, so it devolves upon you to learn the keystroke for the person you're
calling. I didn't say these were going to be perfect. So most of you think of Google as
something that lets you look up a web page, but it is also a dictionary. Type the word
"define" and the word you want to know. You don't even have to click anything. There's the
definition as you type. It's also a complete FAA database. Type the name of the airline
and the flight. It shows you where the flight is, the gate, the terminal, how long until
it lands. You don't need an app. It's also unit and currency conversion. Again, you don't
have to click one of the results. Just type it into the box, and there's your answer. While
we're talking about text — When you want to highlight — this is just an example
—

When you want to highlight a word, please don't waste your life dragging across it with
the mouse like a newbie. Double click the word. Watch "200" — I go double-click, it neatly
selects just that word. Also, don't delete what you've highlighted. You can just type over
it. This is in every program. Also, you can go double-click, drag, to highlight in
one-word increments as you drag. Much more precise. Again, don't bother deleting. Just
type over it.

Shutter lag is the time between your pressing the shutter button and the moment the camera
actually snaps. It's extremely frustrating on any camera under $1,000.(Camera
click)

So, that's because the camera needs time to calculate the focus and exposure, but if you
pre-focus with a half-press, leave your finger down — no shutter lag! You get it every
time. I've just turned your $50 camera into a $1,000 camera with that trick. And finally,
it often happens that you're giving a talk, and for some reason, the audience is looking
at the slide instead of at you!

So when that happens — this works in Keynote, PowerPoint, it works in every program — all
you do is hit the letter B key, B for blackout, to black out the slide, make everybody
look at you, and then when you're ready to go on, you hit B again, and if you're really on
a roll, you can hit the W key for "whiteout," and you white out the slide, and then you
can hit W again to un-blank it. So I know I went super fast. If you missed anything, I'll
be happy to send you the list of these tips. In the meantime, congratulations. You all get
your California Technology License. Have a great day.
