title: What if a single human right could change the world?
speaker: Kristen Wenz
description: >-
 More than a billion people worldwide, mostly children, do not have a legal
 identity. In many countries, this means they can't get access to vital services
 like health care and education, says legal identity expert Kristen Wenz. She
 discusses why this problem is one of the greatest human rights violations of our
 time -- and shares five strategies to ensure everyone can get registered and
 protected.

So, when I was 14, my family was in the process of adopting my little brothers from
Ethiopia. And one day my mom asked, "What day should we put for their birthday?" "Uh, the
day they were born, obviously?" Ridiculous question. And then my mom said, "Well, Kristen,
neither of your little brothers have a birth certificate, so how do you suggest we find
out when that was?" Mind blown. Now, 20 years later, I'm still working on it, except
instead of trying to solve the mystery of my brothers' missing birth certificates, I try
to solve this problem globally. So what do birth certificates have to do with international
development? To answer that, we have to look back at the original development agenda, the
human rights agenda. So in 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for the first
time, set a shared vision of basic human rights and dignities that apply to all people in
all nations: Article 6, the right to be recognized as a person before the law. Or, a legal
identity.

For children, this is a birth certificate. And despite this being a universal human right,
one billion people today have no record they exist, making it one of the greatest human
rights violations of our time, yet nobody seems to know about it. In the face of world
poverty and hunger, making sure everyone in the world has a legal identity doesn't really
seem important, but in reality it is. See, early in my career, I was working with a social
worker in a slum community in Mumbai, and we were following up on a case with this little
girl who had contracted polio as a baby and was paralyzed from the waist down. When we
arrived at the home, we found her on the floor. Her legs were badly scarred and infected,
she was malnourished, she had never gone to school and she had spent most of her life
confined to this small, dark room. When we left, I asked the social worker what the case
plan was, and she said, "Well first, we have to get her a birth certificate." I was a
little taken aback.

I said, "Well, don't you think we need to get her some social assistance and a safe place
to live and into a school?" She goes, "Exactly, which is why we need to get her a birth
certificate."See, without a legal identity, you are not recognized as a person by the
government. And a person who doesn't officially exist can't access government services,
and the government can only provide services for the number of people they know about.
Hence, people are overlooked, for example, by routine immunization services. People without
a legal identity are both uncounted and unprotected. They're among the poorest members of
society from the most marginalized communities. They're victims of trafficking. Human
traffickers know that it's nearly impossible to find someone if there was never a record
they existed in the first place. They're victims of exploitation, such as child marriage
and child labor. Without a birth certificate, how do you prove a child is still a
child?

They're among the stateless; birth certificates provide proof of who your parents are and
where you were born, the two main factors for acquiring nationality. Of the one billion
people in the world without a legal identity, the vast majority are children who were
never registered at birth. In the least developed nations, the births of over 60 percent
of children have never been recorded. A study across 17 countries in sub-Saharan Africa
found that 80 percent of children did not have a birth certificate. Out of the countries
that have not yet achieved universal birth registration coverage, in 26 countries, a birth
certificate is required to access health care, including vaccines. In 37 countries, it's
required to access social assistance intended to bring people out of poverty. And in 59
countries, a birth certificate is required for a child to be enrolled or complete school.
A birth certificate is also often required for other forms of legal identity, like a
national ID or a passport.

And some form of legal identity in almost every country is required to vote, get a SIM
card or open a bank account. In fact, of the 1.7 billion people in the world who are
unbanked, 20 percent is due to not having a legal identity document. Now, you don't have to
be an expert to see that this, times a billion, is a big problem. So it's not surprising
that evidence shows that improved birth registration coverage goes hand in hand with
improved development outcomes, from poverty alleviation to better health, nutrition,
education, economic improvement and safe and orderly migration. In 2015, world leaders came
together and promised that they would uphold human rights of all people and leave no one
behind in efforts to end poverty, hunger and reduce inequalities. But how are they going
to uphold human rights and how do they know if anyone is being left behind if they do not
know who they are or where they are in the first place? So what can countries do about
this?

Now, there's no one-size-fits-all model, because every country context is unique. There
are five proven interventions that can be applied to any system. Number one, reduce the
distance. Two, remove the cost. Three, simplify the process. Four, remove discrimination.
Five, increase demand. Gender discrimination remains a hidden problem, because
statistically, there's no difference between registration rates of boys and girls. But the
discrimination isn't against the child â€” it's against the mother. Angola was one of 35
countries that required a father's name or to be present in order for the child's birth to
be registered. So in situations where the father is unknown, unwilling or unable to claim
paternity, the mothers are legally prevented from registering the births of their own
children. So to address this, Angola put a policy in place allowing mothers to register
their children as a single parent. In Tanzania, in 2012, only 13 percent of children had a
birth certificate.

So the government came up with a new system. They put registration centers in existing
infrastructure, such as community wards and in health facilities. So they brought the
services closer to the people who needed them. They removed the fee. They simplified the
process and automated it, so the birth certificate could be issued on the spot. To
increase demand, they rolled out a public awareness campaign, letting people know that
there's a new process and why it was important to register the births of their children.
In just a few years in the districts where the new system was put in place, 83 percent of
children now have birth certificates, and they're in the process of rolling this out
nationwide. So what can you do? See, I believe we are all united by our humanity. We live
on the same earth. We breathe the same air. And while none of us chose to be born or the
situation we were born into, we do get to choose how we live.

Change occurs when a moment of awareness or a moment of compassion inspires a person to
act. And through our collective action, we become the most powerful agents of change. And
when the cost of inaction is innocent children are left unprotected, unvaccinated, unable
to go to school, growing up to be adults who are unable to find decent work or vote,
trapped in a cycle of poverty, exclusion and invisibility, it comes down to us to take
this issue out of the darkness and into the light. Because it's not every day you get the
opportunity to change the world, but today, you do. Thanks.
