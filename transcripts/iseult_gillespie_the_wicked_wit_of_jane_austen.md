Whether she’s describing bickering families, quiet declarations of love, or juicy gossip,
Jane Austen’s writing often feels as though it was written just for you. Her dry wit and
cheeky playfulness informs her heroines, whose conversational tone welcomes readers with
a conspiratorial wink. It’s even been said that some readers feel like the author’s
secret confidante, trading letters with their delightfully wicked friend Jane. But this
unique brand of tongue-in-cheek humor is just one of the many feats found in her sly
satires of society, civility, and sweeping romance. Written in the early nineteenth
century, Austen's novels decode the sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural
England. From resentment couched in pleasantries to arguing that masks attraction, her
work explores the bewildering collision of emotions and etiquette. But while romance is a
common thread in her work, Austen dismissed the sentimental style of writing so popular
at the time.

Instead of lofty love stories, her characters act naturally, and often awkwardly. They
trade pragmatic advice, friendly jokes and not-so-friendly barbs about their arrogant
peers. As they grapple with the endless rules of their society, Austen’s characters can
usually find humor in all the hypocrisy, propriety, and small talk. As Mr. Bennet jokes 
to his favorite daughter, “For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors and
laugh at them in our turn?”And though her heroines might ridicule senseless social mores,
Austen fully understood the practical importance of maintaining appearances. At the time
she was writing, a wealthy marriage was a financial necessity for most young women, and
she often explores the tension between the mythical quest for love, and the economic
benefits of making a match. The savvy socialite Mary Crawford sums this up in "Mansfield
Park;" “I would have everybody marry if they can do it properly: I do not like to have
people throw themselves away.”Unsurprisingly, these themes were also present in Austen’s
personal life.

Born in 1775, she lived in the social circles found in her novels. Jane's parents
supported her education, and provided space for her to write and publish her work
anonymously. But writing was hardly lucrative work. And although she had sparks of
chemistry, she never married. Elements of her circumstances can be found in many of her
characters; often intelligent women with witty, pragmatic personalities, and rich inner
lives. These headstrong heroines provide an entertaining anchor for their tumultuous
romantic narratives. Like the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet of "Pride and Prejudice," whose
devotion to her sisters’ love lives blinds her to a clumsy suitor. Or the iron-willed
Anne Elliot of "Persuasion," who chooses to remain unmarried after the disappearance of
her first love. And Elinor Dashwood, who fiercely protects her family at the cost of her
own desires in "Sense and Sensibility." These women all encounter difficult choices about
romantic, filial, and financial stability, and they resolve them without sacrificing
their values– or their sense of humor. Of course, these characters are far from
perfect.

They often think they have all the answers. And by telling the story from their
perspective, Austen tricks the viewer into believing their heroine knows best– only to
pull the rug out from under the protagonist and the reader. In "Emma," the titular
character feels surrounded by dull neighbors, and friends who can’t hope to match her
wit. As her guests prattle on and on about nothing, the reader begins to agree– Emma is
the only exciting character in this quiet neighborhood. Yet despite her swelling ego,
Emma may not be as in control as she thinks – in life or love. And Austen’s intimate use
of perspective makes these revelations doubly surprising, blindsiding both Emma and her
audience. But rather than diminishing her host of heroines, these flaws only confirm “the 
inconsistency of all human characters.” Their complexity has kept Austen prominent on
stage and screen, and made her work easily adaptable for modern sensibilities.

So hopefully, new readers will continue to find a friend in Ms. Austen for many years to
come.
