title: The fundamentals of space-time: Part 2
speaker: Andrew Pontzen and Tom Whyntie
description: >-
 Light always travels at a speed of 299,792,458 meters per second. But if you're
 in motion too, you're going to perceive it as traveling even faster -- which
 isn't possible! In this second installment of a three-part series on space-time,
 CERN scientists Andrew Pontzen and Tom Whyntie use a space-time diagram to
 analyze the sometimes confounding motion of light. [Directed by Giant Animation,
 narrated by Andrew Pontzen and Tom Whyntie].

Light: it's the fastest thing in the universe, but we can still measure its speed if we
slow down the animation, we can analyze light's motion using a space-time diagram, which
takes a flipbook of animation panels, and turns them on their side. In this lesson, we'll
add the single experimental fact that whenever anyone measures just how fast light moves,
they get the same answer: 299,792,458 meters every second, which means that when we draw
light on our space-time diagram, it's world line always has to appear at the same angle.
But we saw previously that speed, or equivalently world line angles, change when we look
at things from other people's perspective. To explore this contradiction, let's see what
happens if I start moving while I stand still and shine the laser at Tom. First, we'll
need to construct the space-time diagram. Yes, that means taking all of the different
panels showing the different moments in time and stacking them up.

From the side, we see the world line of the laser light at its correct fixed angle, just
as before. So far, so good. But that space-time diagram represents Andrew's perspective.
What does it look like to me? In the last lesson, we showed how to get Tom's perspective
moving all the panels along a bit until his world line is completely vertical. But look
carefully at the light world line. The rearrangement of the panels means it's now tilted
over too far. I'd measure light traveling faster than Andrew would. But every experiment
we've ever done, and we've tried very hard, says that everyone measures light to have a
fixed speed. So let's start again. In the 1900s, a clever chap named Albert Einstein
worked out how to see things properly, from Tom's point of view, while still getting the
speed of light right. First, we need to glue together the separate panels into one solid
block. This gives us our space-time, turning space and time into one smooth, continuous
material.

And now, here is the trick. What you do is stretch your block of space-time along the
light world line, then squash it by the same amount, but at right angles to the light
world line, and abracadabra! Tom's world line has gone vertical, so this does represent
the world from his point of view, but most importantly, the light world line has never
changed its angle, and so light will be measured by Tom going at the correct speed. This
superb trick is known as a Lorentz transformation. Yeah, more than a trick. Slice up the
space-time into new panels and you have the physically correct animation. I'm stationary
in the car, everything else is coming past me and the speed of light works out to be that
same fixed value that we know everyone measures. On the other hand, something strange has
happened. The fence posts aren't spaced a meter apart anymore, and my mom will be worried
that I look a bit thin. But that's not fair. Why don't I get to look thin?

I thought physics was supposed to be the same for everyone. Yes, no, it is, and you do.
All that stretching and squashing of space-time has just muddled together what we used to
think of separately as space and time. This particular squashing effect is known as
Lorentz contraction. Okay, but I still don't look thin. No, yes, you do. Now that we know
better about space-time, we should redraw what the scene looked like to me. To you, I
appear Lorentz contracted. Oh but to you, I appear Lorentz contracted. Yes. Uh, well, at
least it's fair. And speaking of fairness, just as space gets muddled with time, time also
gets muddled with space, in an effect known as time dilation. No, at everyday speeds, such
as Tom's car reaches, actually all the effects are much, much smaller than we've
illustrated them. Oh, yet, careful experiments, for instance watching the behavior of tiny
particles whizzing around the Large Hadron Collider confirmed that the effects are
real.

And now that space-time is an experimentally confirmed part of reality, we can get a bit
more ambitious. What if we were to start playing with the material of space-time itself?
We'll find out all about that in the next animation.
