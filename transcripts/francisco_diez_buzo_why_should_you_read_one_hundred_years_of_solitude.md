One day in 1965, while driving to Acapulco for a vacation with his family, Colombian
journalist Gabriel García Márquez abruptly turned his car around, asked his wife to take
care of the family’s finances for the coming months, and returned home. The beginning of a
new book had suddenly come to him: “Many years later, as he faced the firing squad,
Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him
to discover ice.”Over the next eighteen months, those words would blossom into One
Hundred Years of Solitude. A novel that would go on to bring Latin American literature to
the forefront of the global imagination, earning García Márquez the 1982 Nobel Prize for
Literature. What makes One Hundred Years of Solitude so remarkable? The novel chronicles
the fortunes and misfortunes of the Buendía family over seven generations. With its lush,
detailed sentences, large cast of characters, and tangled narrative, One Hundred Years of
Solitude is not an easy book to read.

But it’s a deeply rewarding one, with an epic assortment of intense romances, civil war,
political intrigue, globe-trotting adventurers, and more characters named Aureliano than
you’d think possible. Yet this is no mere historical drama. One Hundred Years of Solitude 
is one of the most famous examples of a literary genre known as magical realism. Here,
supernatural events or abilities are described in a realistic and matter-of-fact tone,
while the real events of human life and history reveal themselves to be full of
fantastical absurdity. Surreal phenomena within the fictional village of Macondo
intertwine seamlessly with events taking place in the real country of Colombia. The
settlement begins in a mythical state of isolation, but is gradually exposed to the
outside world, facing multiple calamities along the way. As years pass, characters grow
old and die, only to return as ghosts, or to be seemingly reincarnated in the next
generation.

When the American fruit company comes to town, so does a romantic mechanic who is always
followed by yellow butterflies. A young woman up and floats away. Although the novel moves
forward through subsequent generations, time moves in an almost cyclical manner. Many
characters have similar names and features to their forebears, whose mistakes they often
repeat. Strange prophecies and visits from mysterious gypsies give way to the skirmishes 
and firing squads of repeated civil wars. An American fruit company opens a plantation
near the village and ends up massacring thousands of striking workers, mirroring the
real-life ‘Banana Massacre’ of 1928. Combined with the novel’s magical realism, this
produces a sense of history as a downward spiral the characters seem powerless to escape.
Beneath the magic is a story about the pattern of Colombian and Latin American history 
from colonial times onward. This is a history that the author experienced
firsthand.

Gabriel García Márquez grew up in a Colombia torn apart by civil conflict between its
Conservative and Liberal political parties. He also lived in an autocratic Mexico and
covered the 1958 Venezuelan coup d’état as a journalist. But perhaps his biggest
influences were his maternal grandparents. Nicolás Ricardo Márquez was a decorated
veteran of the Thousand Days War whose accounts of the rebellion against Colombia's
conservative government led Gabriel García Márquez to a socialist outlook. Meanwhile,
Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes’ omnipresent superstition became the foundation of One
Hundred Years of Solitude’s style. Their small house in Aracataca where the author spent
his childhood formed the main inspiration for Macondo. With One Hundred Years of Solitude,
Gabriel García Márquez found a unique way to capture the unique history of Latin
America. He was able to depict the strange reality of living in a post-colonial society,
forced to relive the tragedies of the past. In spite of all this fatalism, the novel still
holds hope.

At his Nobel Lecture, García Marquez reflected on Latin America’s long history of civil
strife and rampant iniquity. Yet he ended the speech by affirming the possibility of
building a better world, to quote, “where no one will be able to decide for others how
they die, where love will prove true and happiness be possible, and where the races
condemned to one hundred years of solitude will have, at last and forever, a second
chance on earth."
