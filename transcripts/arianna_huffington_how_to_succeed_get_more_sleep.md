title: How to succeed? Get more sleep
speaker: Arianna Huffington
description: >-
 In this short talk, Arianna Huffington shares a small idea that can awaken much
 bigger ones: the power of a good night's sleep. Instead of bragging about our
 sleep deficits, she urges us to shut our eyes and see the big picture: We can
 sleep our way to increased productivity and happiness -- and smarter decision-making.

My big idea is a very, very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at
the moment dormant inside us. And my little idea that will do that is sleep.

This is a room of type A women. This is a room of sleep-deprived women. And I learned the
hard way the value of sleep. Two-and-a-half years ago, I fainted from exhaustion. I hit my
head on my desk. I broke my cheekbone, I got five stitches on my right eye. And I began
the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep. And in the course of that, I studied, I
met with medical doctors, scientists, and I'm here to tell you that the way to a more
productive, more inspired, more joyful life is getting enough sleep.

And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution, this new feminist issue. We
are literally going to sleep our way to the top — literally —

because unfortunately, for men, sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol. I was
recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the
night before. And I felt like saying to him — but I didn't say — I felt like saying, "You
know what? if you had gotten five, this dinner would have been a lot more
interesting."

There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship. Especially here in Washington, if
you try to make a breakfast date, and you say, "How about eight o'clock?" they're likely
to tell you, "Eight o'clock is too late for me, but that's OK, I can get a game of tennis
in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight." And they think that means they
are so incredibly busy and productive, but the truth is, they're not, because we, at the
moment, have had brilliant leaders in business, in finance, in politics, making terrible
decisions. So a high IQ does not mean that you're a good leader, because the essence of
leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic.

And we've had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics. In fact, I have a feeling that
if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters, they might still be
around.

While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24/7, maybe a sister would
have noticed the iceberg, because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or
eight-hour sleep, and have been able to see the big picture. So as we are facing all the
multiple crises in our world at the moment, what is good for us on a personal level,
what's going to bring more joy, gratitude, effectiveness in our lives and be the best for
our own careers, is also what is best for the world. So I urge you to shut your eyes, and
discover the great ideas that lie inside us; to shut your engines and discover the power
of sleep. Thank you.
