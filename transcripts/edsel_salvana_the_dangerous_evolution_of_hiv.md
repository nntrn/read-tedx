title: The dangerous evolution of HIV
speaker: Edsel Salvaña
description: >-
 Think we're winning the battle against HIV? Maybe not, as the next wave of
 drug-resistant viruses arrives. In an eye-opening talk, TED Fellow Edsel Salvana
 describes the aggressive HIV subtype AE that's currently plaguing his home of the
 Philippines -- and warns us about what might become a global epidemic.

The Philippines: an idyllic country with some of the clearest water and bluest skies on
the planet. It is also the epicenter of one of the fastest-growing HIV epidemics in the
world. On the surface, it seems as if we are just a late bloomer. However, the reasons for
our current epidemic are much more complicated and may foreshadow a global resurgence of
HIV.While overall new cases of HIV continue to drop in the world, this trend may be
short-lived when the next wave of more aggressive and resistant viruses arrive. HIV has a
potential to transform itself into a new and different virus every time it infects a cell.
Despite the remarkable progress we've made in reversing the epidemic, the truth is that we
are just a few viral mutations away from disaster. To appreciate the profound way in which
HIV transforms itself every time it reproduces, let's make a genetic comparison. If we
look at the DNA variation among humans of different races from different continents, the
actual DNA difference is only 0.1 percent.

If we look at the genetic difference between humans, great apes, and rhesus macaques, that
number is seven percent. In contrast, the genetic difference between HIV subtypes from
different patients may be as much as 35 percent. Within a person infected with HIV, the
genetic difference between an infecting mother virus and subsequent daughter viruses has
been shown to be as much as five percent. This is the equivalent of a gorilla giving birth
to a chimpanzee, then to an orangutan, then to a baboon, then to any random great ape
within its lifetime. There are nearly 100 subtypes of HIV, with new subtypes being
discovered regularly. HIV in the developed world is almost all of one subtype: subtype B.
Mostly everything we know and do to treat HIV is based on studies on subtype B, even
though it only accounts for 12 percent of the total number of cases of HIV in the world.
But because of the profound genetic difference among different subtypes, some subtypes are
more likely to become drug-resistant or progress to AIDS faster. We discovered that the
explosion of HIV cases in the Philippines is due to a shift from the Western subtype B to
a more aggressive Southeast Asian subtype AE.

We are seeing younger and sicker patients with high rates of drug resistance. Initial
encroachment of this subtype is already occurring in developed countries, including
Australia, Canada and the United States. We may soon see a similar explosion of cases in
these countries. And while we think that HIV is done and that the tide has turned for it,
just like with real tides, it can come right back. In the early 1960s, malaria was on the
ropes. As the number of cases dropped, people and governments stopped paying attention.
The result was a deadly resurgence of drug-resistant malaria. We need to think of HIV not
as a single virus that we think we've figured out, but as a collection of rapidly evolving
and highly unique viruses, each of which can set off the next deadly epidemic. We are
incorporating more powerful and new tools to help us detect the next deadly HIV strain,
and this needs to go hand in hand with urgent research on the behavior and proper
treatment of non-B subtypes.

We need to convince our governments and our funding agencies that HIV is not yet done. Over
35 million people have died of HIV. We are on the verge of an AIDS-free generation. We
need to pay attention. We need to remain vigilant and follow through. Otherwise, millions
more will die. Thank you.
