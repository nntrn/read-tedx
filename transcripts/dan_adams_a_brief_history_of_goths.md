What do fans of atmospheric post-punk music have in common with ancient barbarians? Not
much. So why are both known as goths? Is it a weird coincidence or a deeper connection
stretching across the centuries? The story begins in Ancient Rome. As the Roman Empire
expanded, it faced raids and invasions from the semi-nomadic populations along its
borders. Among the most powerful were a Germanic people known as Goths who were composed
of two tribal groups, the Visigoths and Ostrogoths. While some of the Germanic tribes
remained Rome's enemies, the Empire incorporated others into the imperial army. As the
Roman Empire split in two, these tribal armies played larger roles in its defense and
internal power struggles. In the 5th century, a mercenary revolt lead by a soldier named
Odoacer captured Rome and deposed the Western Emperor. Odoacer and his Ostrogoth
successor Theoderic technically remained under the Eastern Emperor's authority and
maintained Roman traditions.

But the Western Empire would never be united again. Its dominions fragmented into kingdoms
ruled by Goths and other Germanic tribes who assimilated into local cultures, though many
of their names still mark the map. This was the end of the Classical Period and the
beginning of what many call the Dark Ages. Although Roman culture was never fully lost,
its influence declined and new art styles arose focused on religious symbolism and
allegory rather than proportion and realism. This shift extended to architecture with the
construction of the Abbey of Saint Denis in France in 1137. Pointed arches, flying
buttresses, and large windows made the structure more skeletal and ornate. That emphasized
its open, luminous interior rather than the sturdy walls and columns of Classical
buildings. Over the next few centuries, this became a model for Cathedrals throughout
Europe. But fashions change. With the Italian Renaissance's renewed admiration for Ancient
Greece and Rome, the more recent style began to seem crude and inferior in
comparison.

Writing in his 1550 book, "Lives of the Artists," Giorgio Vasari was the first to
describe it as Gothic, a derogatory reference to the Barbarians thought to have destroyed 
Classical civilization. The name stuck, and soon came to describe the Medieval period
overall, with its associations of darkness, superstition, and simplicity. But time marched
on, as did what was considered fashionable. In the 1700s, a period called the
Enlightenment came about, which valued scientific reason above all else. Reacting against
that, Romantic authors like Goethe and Byron sought idealized visions of a past of natural
landscapes and mysterious spiritual forces. Here, the word Gothic was repurposed again to
describe a literary genre that emerged as a darker strain of Romanticism. The term was
first applied by Horace Walpole to his own 1764 novel, "The Castle of Otranto" as a
reference to the plot and general atmosphere.

Many of the novel's elements became genre staples inspiring classics and the countless
movies they spawned. The gothic label belonged to literature and film until the 1970s when
a new musical scene emerged. Taking cues from artists like The Doors and The Velvet
Underground, British post-punk groups, like Joy Division, Bauhaus, and The Cure, combined
gloomy lyrics and punk dissonance with imagery inspired by the Victorian era, classic
horror, and androgynous glam fashion. By the early 1980s, similar bands were consistently
described as Gothic rock by the music press, and the stye's popularity brought it out of
dimly lit clubs to major labels and MTV. And today, despite occasional negative media
attention and stereotypes, Gothic music and fashion continue as a strong underground
phenomenon. They've also branched into sub-genres, such as cybergoth, gothabilly, gothic
metal, and even steampunk.

The history of the word gothic is embedded in thousands of years worth of countercultural
movements, from invading outsiders becoming kings to towering spires replacing solid
columns to artists finding beauty in darkness. Each step has seen a revolution of sorts
and a tendency for civilization to reach into its past to reshape its present.
