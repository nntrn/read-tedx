Antibiotics: behind the scenes, they enable much of modern medicine. We use them to cure
infectious diseases, but also to safely facilitate everything from surgery to
chemotherapy to organ transplants. Without antibiotics, even routine medical procedures 
can lead to life-threatening infections. And we’re at risk of losing them. Antibiotics are
chemicals that prevent the growth of bacteria. Unfortunately, some bacteria have become
resistant to all currently available antibiotics. At the same time, we’ve stopped
discovering new ones. Still, there’s hope that we can get ahead of the problem. But first,
how did we get into this situation? The first widely used antibiotic was penicillin,
discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. In his 1945 Nobel Prize acceptance speech,
Fleming warned that bacterial resistance had the potential to ruin the miracle of
antibiotics. He was right: in the 1940s and 50s, resistant bacteria already began to
appear. From then until the 1980s, pharmaceutical companies countered the problem of
resistance by discovering many new antibiotics.

At first this was a highly successful— and highly profitable— enterprise. Over time, a
couple things changed. Newly discovered antibiotics were often only effective for a
narrow spectrum of infections, whereas the first ones had been broadly applicable. This
isn’t a problem in itself, but it does mean that fewer doses of these drugs could be
sold— making them less profitable. In the early days, antibiotics were heavily
overprescribed, including for viral infections they had no effect on. Scrutiny around
prescriptions increased, which is good, but also lowered sales. At the same time, 
companies began to develop more drugs that are taken over a patient’s lifetime, like blood
pressure and cholesterol medications, and later anti-depressants and anti-anxiety
medications. Because they are taken indefinitely, these drugs more profitable. By the
mid-1980s, no new chemical classes of antibiotics were discovered.

But bacteria continued to acquire resistance and pass it along by sharing genetic
information between individual bacteria and even across species. Now bacteria that are
resistant to many antibiotics are common, and increasingly some strains are resistant to
all our current drugs. So, what can we do about this? We need to control the use of
existing antibiotics, create new ones, combat resistance to new and existing drugs, and
find new ways to fight bacterial infections. The largest consumer of antibiotics is
agriculture, which uses antibiotics not only to treat infections but to promote the
growth of food animals. Using large volumes of antibiotics increases the bacteria’s
exposure to the antibiotics and therefore their opportunity to develop resistance. Many
bacteria that are common in animals, like salmonella, can also infect humans, and
drug-resistant versions can pass to us through the food chain and spread through
international trade and travel networks. In terms of finding new antibiotics, nature
offers the most promising new compounds.

Organisms like other microbes and fungi have evolved over millions of years to live in
competitive environments— meaning they often contain antibiotic compounds to give them a
survival advantage over certain bacteria. We can also package antibiotics with molecules
that inhibit resistance. One way bacteria develop resistance is through proteins of their
own that degrade the drug. By packaging the antibiotic with molecules that block the
degraders, the antibiotic can do its job. Phages, viruses that attack bacteria but don’t
affect humans, are one promising new avenue to combat bacterial infections. Developing
vaccines for common infections, meanwhile, can help prevent disease in the first
place. The biggest challenge to all these approaches is funding, which is woefully
inadequate across the globe. Antibiotics are so unprofitable that many large
pharmaceutical companies have stopped trying to develop them.

Meanwhile, smaller companies that successfully bring new antibiotics to market often
still go bankrupt, like the American start up Achaogen. New therapeutic techniques like
phages and vaccines face the same fundamental problem as traditional antibiotics: if
they’re working well, they’re used just once, which makes it difficult to make money. And
to successfully counteract resistance in the long term, we’ll need to use new
antibiotics sparingly— lowering the profits for their creators even further. One possible
solution is to shift profits away from the volume of antibiotics sold. For example, the
United Kingdom is testing a model where healthcare providers purchase antibiotic
subscriptions. While governments are looking for ways to incentivize antibiotic
development, these programs are still in the early stages. Countries around the world 
will need to do much more— but with enough investment in antibiotic development and
controlled use of our current drugs, we can still get ahead of resistance.
