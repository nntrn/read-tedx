After a savage seafaring skirmish and eight long days of being battered by waves,
Väinämöinen— a powerful bard and sage as old as the world itself— washed up on the shores
 of distant Pohjola. Unlike his home Kalevala, Pohjola was a dark and frozen land, ruled
by Louhi, “the gap-tooth hag of the North." The cunning witch nursed Väinämöinen back to
health but demanded a reward for returning him home. Not content with mere gold or
silver, Louhi wanted what did not yet exist— the Sampo. To be forged from “the tips of
white-swan feathers," “the milk of greatest virtue," “a single grain of barley," and “the
finest wool of lambskins," this artifact was said to be an endless font of wealth. But
Väinämöinen knew that only Seppo Ilmarinen, the Eternal Hammerer who forged the sky-dome
itself, could craft such an object. So he convinced Louhi to send him home and fetch the
smith. Though the journey was far from easy, the bard finally made it back to
Kalevala.

But Ilmarinen refused to go to the gloomy North— a land of witches and man-eaters. But
keeping true to his word, Väinämöinen tricked Ilmarinen into climbing a giant tree,
before summoning a mighty storm to carry the smith all the way to Pohjola. Ilmarinen was
well received in the North. Louhi lavished her guest with extravagant hospitality and
promised him the hand of her beautiful daughter— if he could craft what she wished. When
she finally asked if Ilmarinen was capable of forging the Sampo, the powerful smith
declared he could indeed accomplish the task. But try as he might to bend the forge to
his will, its fires only produced other artifacts— beautiful in appearance but 
ill-mannered in nature. An elegant crossbow that thirsted for blood and a gleaming plow
that ruined cultivated fields among others. Finally, Ilmarinen summoned the winds 
themselves to work the bellows, and in three days time he pulled the Sampo, with its lid
of many colors from the forge’s flames.

On its sides the smith carefully crafted a grain mill, a salt mill, and a money mill.
Louhi was so delighted with the object’s limitless productive power that she ran off to
lock her treasure inside a mountain. But when Ilmarinen tried to claim his prize, the
promised maiden refused to marry him, and the smith had to return home alone. Years passed,
and while Pohjola prospered, Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen were without wives or great
wealth. Bitter about this injustice, the bard proposed a quest to retrieve the Sampo, and
the two sailed north with the help of Lemminkäinen— a beautiful young man with a history 
of starting trouble. Upon arrival, Väinämöinen requested half the Sampo’s profits as
compensation— or they’d take the artifact by force. Outraged at this request, Louhi
summoned her forces to fight the heroes. But as her army readied for war, the bard
played his magic harp, Kantele, entrancing all who heard it and sending Pohjola into a
deep slumber.

Unimpeded, the three men took the Sampo and quietly made their escape. Lemminkäinen was
ecstatic at their success, and demanded that Väinämöinen sing of their triumph. The bard
refused, knowing the dangers of celebrating too early. But after three days of traveling,
 Lemminkäinen’s excitement overwhelmed him, and he recklessly broke out in song. His awful
singing voice woke a nearby crane, whose screeching cries roused the Pohjolan horde. The
army made chase. As their warship closed in, Väinämöinen raised a rock to breach their
hull. Undeterred, Louhi transformed into a giant eagle, carrying her army on her back as
they attacked the heroes’ vessel. She managed to grab the Sampo in her claw, but just as
quickly, it dropped into the sea, shattering into pieces and sinking deep beyond her
talon’s reach. Buried on the ocean floor, the remnants of this powerful device remain in
the realm of Ahti, god of water— where they grind salt for the seas to this very
day.
