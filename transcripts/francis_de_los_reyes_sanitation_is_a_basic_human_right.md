 Warning: This talk might contain much more than you'd ever want to know about the
 way the world poops. But as sanitation activist (and TED Fellow) Francis de los
 Reyes asks — doesn't everyone deserve a safe place to go?

I am an engineering professor, and for the past 14 years I've been teaching crap.

Not that I'm a bad teacher, but I've been studying and teaching about human waste and how
waste is conveyed through these wastewater treatment plants, and how we engineer and
design these treatment plants so that we can protect surface water like rivers. I've based
my scientific career on using leading-edge molecular techniques, DNA- and RNA-based
methods to look at microbial populations in biological reactors, and again to optimize
these systems. And over the years, I have developed an unhealthy obsession with toilets,
and I've been known to sneak into toilets and take my camera phone all over the world. But
along the way, I've learned that it's not just the technical side, but there's also this
thing called the culture of crap. So for example, how many of you are washers and how many
of you are wipers? 

If, well, I guess you know what I mean. If you're a washer, then you use water for anal
cleansing. That's the technical term. And if you're a wiper, then you use toilet paper or,
in some regions of the world where it's not available, newspaper or rags or corncobs. And
this is not just a piece of trivia, but it's really important to understand and solve the
sanitation problem. And it is a big problem: There are 2.5 billion people in the world who
don't have access to adequate sanitation. For them, there's no modern toilet. And there
are 1.1 billion people whose toilets are the streets or river banks or open spaces, and
again, the technical term for that is open defecation, but that is really simply shitting
in the open. And if you're living in fecal material and it's surrounding you, you're going
to get sick. It's going to get into your drinking water, into your food, into your
immediate surroundings.

So the United Nations estimates that every year, there are 1.5 million child deaths
because of inadequate sanitation. That's one preventable death every 20 seconds, 171 every
hour, 4,100 every day. And so, to avoid open defecation, municipalities and cities build
infrastructure, for example, like pit latrines, in peri-urban and rural areas. For
example, in KwaZulu-Natal province in South Africa, they've built tens of thousands of
these pit latrines. But there's a problem when you scale up to tens of thousands, and the
problem is, what happens when the pits are full? This is what happens. People defecate
around the toilet. In schools, children defecate on the floors and then leave a trail
outside the building and start defecating around the building, and these pits have to be
cleaned and manually emptied. And who does the emptying? You've got these workers who have
to sometimes go down into the pits and manually remove the contents. It's a dirty and
dangerous business.

As you can see, there's no protective equipment, no protective clothing. There's one
worker down there. I hope you can see him. He's got a face mask on, but no shirt. And in
some countries, like India, the lower castes are condemned to empty the pits, and they're
further condemned by society. So you ask yourself, how can we solve this and why don't we
just build Western-style flush toilets for these two and a half billion? And the answer
is, it's just not possible. In some of these areas, there's not enough water, there's no
energy, it's going to cost tens of trillions of dollars to lay out the sewer lines and to
build the facilities and to operate and maintain these systems, and if you don't build it
right, you're going to have flush toilets that basically go straight into the river, just
like what's happening in many cities in the developing world. And is this really the
solution? Because essentially, what you're doing is you're using clean water and you're
using it to flush your toilet, convey it to a wastewater treatment plant which then
discharges to a river, and that river, again, is a drinking water source. So we've got to
rethink sanitation, and we've got to reinvent the sanitation infrastructure, and I'm going
to argue that to do this, you have to employ systems thinking.

We have to look at the whole sanitation chain. We start with a human interface, and then
we have to think about how feces are collected and stored, transported, treated and reused
— and not just disposal but reuse. So let's start with the human user interface. I say, it
doesn't matter if you're a washer or a wiper, a sitter or a squatter, the human user
interface should be clean and easy to use, because after all, taking a dump should be
pleasurable. 

And when we open the possibilities to understanding this sanitation chain, then the
back-end technology, the collection to the reuse, should not really matter, and then we
can apply locally adoptable and context-sensitive solutions. So we can open ourselves to
possibilities like, for example, this urine-diverting toilet, and there's two holes in
this toilet. There's the front and the back, and the front collects the urine, and the
back collects the fecal material. And so what you're doing is you're separating the urine,
which has 80 percent of the nitrogen and 50 percent of the phosphorus, and then that can
then be treated and precipitated to form things like struvite, which is a high-value
fertilizer, and then the fecal material can then be disinfected and again converted to
high-value end products. Or, for example, in some of our research, you can reuse the water
by treating it in on-site sanitation systems like planter boxes or constructed
wetlands.

So we can open up all these possibilities if we take away the old paradigm of flush
toilets and treatment plants. So you might be asking, who's going to pay? Well, I'm going
to argue that governments should fund sanitation infrastructure. NGOs and donor
organizations, they can do their best, but it's not going to be enough. Governments should
fund sanitation the same way they fund roads and schools and hospitals and other
infrastructure like bridges, because we know, and the WHO has done this study, that for
every dollar that we invest in sanitation infrastructure, we get something like three to
34 dollars back. Let's go back to the problem of pit emptying. So at North Carolina State
University, we challenged our students to come up with a simple solution, and this is what
they came up with: a simple, modified screw auger that can move the waste up from the pit
and into a collecting drum, and now the pit worker doesn't have to go down into the
pit.

We tested it in South Africa, and it works. We need to make it more robust, and we're
going to do more testing in Malawi and South Africa this coming year. And our idea is to
make this a professionalized pit-emptying service so that we can create a small business
out of it, create profits and jobs, and the hope is that, as we are rethinking sanitation,
we are extending the life of these pits so that we don't have to resort to quick solutions
that don't really make sense. I believe that access to adequate sanitation is a basic human
right. We need to stop the practice of lower castes and lower-status people going down and
being condemned to empty pits. It is our moral, it is our social and our environmental
obligation. Thank you.
