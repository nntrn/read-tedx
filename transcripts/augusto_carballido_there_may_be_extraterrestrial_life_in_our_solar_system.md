title: There may be extraterrestrial life in our solar system

 Deep in our solar system, a new era of exploration is unfolding. Beneath the
 thick ice of Europa; in the vapor plumes on Enceladus; and within the methane
 lakes of Titan, scientists are hunting for extraterrestrial life. These moons are
 'ocean worlds'— they contain liquid oceans, which can support the formation of
 life. Does life exist on ocean worlds? Augusto Carballido explores the possibility.

Deep in our solar system, a new era of space exploration is unfolding. Beneath the thick
ice of Europa, in the vapor plumes on Enceladus, and within the methane lakes of Titan,
astrobiologists are on the hunt for extraterrestrial life. We’ve honed in on these three
moons because each is an ‘ocean world,’ an environment that contains a liquid ocean– and
liquid can support the formation of life. Living organisms have to be able to grow, 
reproduce, and feed themselves, among other things. All of those functions require the 
formation of complex molecules from more basic components. Liquids such as water allow
chemical compounds to remain in suspension instead of sinking under the force of
gravity. This enables them to interact frequently in a 3-dimensional space and, in the
right conditions, go through chemical reactions that lead to the formation of living
matter. That alone isn’t enough; the small but complex biomolecules that we’re familiar
with are sensitive to temperature— too hot or cold, and they won’t mix.

Liquid water has an additional advantage in that it’s relatively temperature-stable,
meaning it can insulate molecules against large shifts in heat. On Earth, these and other
conditions in aquatic environments may have supported the emergence of life billions of
years ago. Tantalizingly, the same could be true in other parts of our solar system, like
these three icy moons. Europa, which is a moon of Jupiter, is probably the most intriguing
ocean world. Beneath a surface layer of ice thicker than Mount Everest, there exists a
liquid ocean as much as 100 kilometers deep. Astrobiologists think this hidden ocean
could harbor life. Thanks to the Galileo probe, we can deduce that its potential salt
content is similar to that of some lakes on Earth. But most of its characteristics will be
a mystery until we can explore it further. Like Jupiter, Saturn also has moons that might
have the right conditions for life.

For instance– Enceladus is a tiny ball of ice that’s small enough to nestle within the
surface area of the Gulf of Mexico. Similarly to Europa, it likely contains an ocean deep
under the ice. But Enceladus also has geysers that frequently vent water vapor and tiny
ice grains into space. Astrobiologists are curious about whether these geysers are
connected to the ocean below. They hope to send a probe to test whether the geysers’
plumes of vapor contain life-enabling material from that hidden sea. Although it’s the best
known substance for nurturing life, water isn’t necessarily the only medium that can
support living things. Take Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, which has a thick nitrogen
atmosphere containing methane and many other organic molecules. Its clouds condense and 
rain onto Titan’s surface, sustaining lakes and seas full of liquid methane. This
compound’s particular chemistry means it’s not as supportive a medium as
water.

But, paired with the high quantities of organic material that also rain down from the
sky, these bodies of liquid methane could possibly support unfamiliar life forms. So what
might indicate that life exists on these or other worlds? If it is out there,
astrobiologists speculate that it would be microscopic, comparable to the bacteria we
have on earth. This would make it difficult to directly observe from a great distance, so
astrobiologists seek clues called biosignatures. Those may be cells, fossils, or mineral 
traces left behind by living things. And finding any biosignatures will be challenging
for many reasons. One of the biggest concerns is to make sure we sterilize our probes
extremely thoroughly. Otherwise we could accidentally contaminate ocean worlds with
Earth’s own bacteria, which could destroy alien life. Titan, Enceladus, and Europa are just
three of possibly many ocean worlds that we could explore.

We already know of several other candidates in our solar system, including Jupiter’s
moons Callisto and Ganymede, Neptune’s Triton, and even Pluto. If there’s this much
potential for life to exist in our own tiny solar system, what unimagined secrets might
the rest of the universe contain?
