Basically, there's a major demographic event going on. And it may be that passing the 50
percent urban point is an economic tipping point. So the world now is a map of
connectivity. It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities.
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West. That's over. The aggregate numbers
are overwhelming. So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying
out. The question is, why? And here's the unromantic truth â€” and the city air makes you
free, they said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to places like Shanghai but most
go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule. And these are not really a people
oppressed by poverty. They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can. They're
the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers. They have home-brewed
infrastructure and vibrant urban life. One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of
Mumbai.

They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps. Education is the
main event that can happen in cities. What's going on in the street in Mumbai? Al Gore
knows. It's basically everything. There's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone
works. One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that. So here's the
first punch line: cities have defused the population bomb. And here's the second punch
line. That's the news from downtown. Here it is in perspective. Stars have shined down on
earth's life for billions of years. Now we're shining right back up. Thank
you.
