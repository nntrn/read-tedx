title: How this disease changes the shape of your cells
speaker: Amber M. Yates
description: >-
 What shape are your cells? Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags? You might not
 spend a lot of time thinking about the bodies of these building blocks, but
 microscopically, small variations can have huge consequences. And while some
 adaptations change these shapes for the better, others can spark debilitating
 complications. Amber M. Yates dives into the science of the malignant sickle-cell
 mutation. [Directed by Axon Animation LLC, narrated by Susan Zimmerman, music by
 Stephen LaRosa].

What shape are your cells? Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags? You probably don’t think
much about the bodies of these building blocks, but at the microscopic level, small 
changes can have huge consequences. And while some adaptations change these shapes for
the better, others can spark a cascade of debilitating complications. This is the story
of sickle-cell disease. Sickle-cell disease affects the red blood cells, which transport
oxygen from the lungs to all the tissues in the body. To perform this vital task, red
blood cells are filled with hemoglobin proteins to carry oxygen molecules. These proteins
float independently inside the red blood cell’s pliable, doughnut-like shape, keeping the
cells flexible enough to accommodate even the tiniest of blood vessels. But in sickle
cell disease, a single genetic mutation alters the structure of hemoglobin. After
releasing oxygen to tissues, these mutated proteins lock together into rigid
rows.

Rods of hemoglobin cause the cell to deform into a long, pointed sickle. These red blood
cells are harder and stickier, and no longer flow smoothly through blood vessels.
Sickled cells snag and pile up– sometimes blocking the vessel completely. This keeps
oxygen from reaching a variety of cells, causing the wide range of symptoms experienced by
people with sickle-cell disease. Starting when they’re less than a year old, patients
suffer from repeated episodes of stabbing pain in oxygen-starved tissues. The location of
the clogged vessel determines the specific symptoms experienced. A blockage in the
spleen, part of the immune system, puts patients at risk for dangerous infections. A
pileup in the lungs can produce fevers and difficulty breathing. A clog near the eye can
cause vision problems and retinal detachment. And if the obstructed vessels supply the
brain the patient could even suffer a stroke. Worse still, sickled red blood cells also
don’t survive very long— just 10 or 20 days, versus a healthy cell’s 4
months.

This short lifespan means that patients live with a constantly depleted supply of red
blood cells; a condition called sickle-cell anemia. Perhaps what’s most surprising about
this malignant mutation is that it originally evolved as a beneficial adaptation.
Researchers have been able to trace the origins of the sickle cell mutation to regions
historically ravaged by a tropical disease called malaria. Spread by a parasite found in
local mosquitoes, malaria uses red blood cells as incubators to spread quickly and
lethally through the bloodstream. However, the same structural changes that turn red blood
cells into roadblocks also make them more resistant to malaria. And if a child inherits a
copy of the mutation from only one parent, there will be just enough abnormal hemoglobin
to make life difficult for the malaria parasite, while most of their red blood cells
retain their normal shape and function.

In regions rife with this parasite, sickle cell mutation offered a serious evolutionary
advantage. But as the adaptation flourished, it became clear that inheriting the mutation
from both parents resulted in sickle-cell anemia. Today, most people with sickle-cell
disease can trace their ancestry to a country where malaria is endemic. And this mutation
still plays a key role in Africa, where more than 90% of malaria infections occur
worldwide. Fortunately, as this “adaptation” thrives, our treatment for sickle cell
continues to improve. For years, hydroxyurea was the only medication available to reduce
the amount of sickling, blunting symptoms and increasing life expectancy. Bone marrow
transplantations offer a curative measure, but these procedures are complicated and
often inaccessible. But promising new medications are intervening in novel ways, like
keeping oxygen bonded to hemoglobin to prevent sickling, or reducing the stickiness of
sickled cells.

And the ability to edit DNA has raised the possibility of enabling stem cells to produce
normal hemoglobin. As these tools become available in the areas most affected by malaria
and sickle cell disease, we can improve the quality of life for more patients with this 
adverse adaptation.
