title: The life cycle of a neutron star
speaker: David Lunney
description: >-
 About once every century, a massive star somewhere in our galaxy runs out of
 fuel. No longer able to produce sufficient energy to maintain its structure, it
 collapses under its own gravitational pressure and explodes in a supernova. The
 death of that star is the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known
 objects in the universe. David Lunney explores what, exactly, a neutron star is.

About once every century, a massive star somewhere in our galaxy runs out of fuel. This
happens after millions of years of heat and pressure have fused the star’s hydrogen into
heavier elements like helium, carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron. No longer able to
produce sufficient energy to maintain its structure, it collapses under its own
gravitational pressure and explodes in a supernova. The star shoots most of its innards
into space, seeding the galaxy with heavy elements. But what this cataclysmic eruption
leaves behind might be even more remarkable: a ball of matter so dense that atomic
electrons collapse from their quantum orbits into the depths of atomic nuclei. The death
of that star is the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known objects in the
universe, and a laboratory for the strange physics of supercondensed matter. But what is a
neutron star? Think of a compact ball inside of which protons and electrons fuse into
neutrons and form a frictionless liquid called a superfluid— surrounded by a
crust.

This material is incredibly dense – the equivalent of the mass of a fully-loaded
container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest in a space of a
sugar cube. Deeper in the crust, the neutron superfluid forms different phases that
physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna to spaghetti-like
shapes. The massive precursors to neutron stars often spin. When they collapse, stars that
are typically millions of kilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are only
about 25 kilometers across. But the original star’s angular momentum is preserved. So for
the same reason that a figure skater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms,
the neutron star spins much more rapidly than its parent. The fastest neutron star on
record rotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface 
whirls through space at more than a fifth of the speed of light.

Neutron stars also have the strongest magnetic field of any known object. This magnetic
concentration forms vortexes that radiate beams from the magnetic poles. Since the poles
aren’t always aligned with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like
lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink when viewed from Earth. We call those pulsars.
The detection of one of these tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell
in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly discovered neutron stars in the first place. An
aging neutron star’s furious rotation slows over a period of billions of years as it
radiates away its energy in the form of electromagnetic and gravity waves. But not all
neutron stars disappear so quietly. For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a
neutron star co-orbits another star. A neutron star can feed on a lighter companion,
gorging on its more loosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing cataclysmically
into a black hole. While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of
those end up as neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other in a
waltz doomed to end as a merger.

When they finally collide, they send gravity waves through space-time like ripples from a
stone thrown into a calm lake. Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this
phenomenon over 100 years ago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when
gravitational-wave observatories LIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision. Other
telescopes picked up a burst of gamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and
radio signals, all from the same impact. That became the most studied event in the
history of astronomy. It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed
 of gravity, bolster important theories in astrophysics, and provide evidence for the
origin of heavy elements like gold and platinum. Neutron stars haven’t given up all their
secrets yet. LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded to detect more collisions. That’ll help us
learn what else the spectacular demise of these dense, pulsating, spinning magnets can
tell us about the universe.
