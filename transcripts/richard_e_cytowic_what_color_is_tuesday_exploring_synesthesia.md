title: What color is Tuesday? Exploring synesthesia
speaker: Richard E. Cytowic
description: >-
 How does one experience synesthesia -- the neurological trait that combines two
 or more senses? Synesthetes may taste the number 9 or attach a color to each day
 of the week. Richard E. Cytowic explains the fascinating world of entangled
 senses and why we may all have just a touch of synesthesia. [Directed by TED-Ed,
 narrated by Richard E. Cytowic].

Imagine a world in which you see numbers and letters as colored even though they're
printed in black, in which music or voices trigger a swirl of moving, colored shapes, in
which words and names fill your mouth with unusual flavors. Jail tastes like cold, hard
bacon while Derek tastes like earwax. Welcome to synesthesia, the neurological phenomenon
that couples two or more senses in 4% of the population. A synesthete might not only hear
my voice, but also see it, taste it, or feel it as a physical touch. Sharing the same root
with anesthesia, meaning no sensation, synesthesia means joined sensation. Having one
type, such as colored hearing, gives you a 50% chance of having a second, third, or fourth
type. One in 90 among us experience graphemes, the written elements of language, like
letters, numerals, and punctuation marks, as saturated with color. Some even have gender
or personality. For Gail, 3 is athletic and sporty, 9 is a vain, elitist
girl.

By contrast, the sound units of language, or phonemes, trigger synestetic tastes. For
James, college tastes like sausage, as does message and similar words with the -age
ending. Synesthesia is a trait, like having blue eyes, rather than a disorder because
there's nothing wrong. In fact, all the extra hooks endow synesthetes with superior
memories. For example, a girl runs into someone she met long ago. "Let's see, she had a
green name. D's are green: Debra, Darby, Dorothy, Denise. Yes! Her name is Denise!" Once
established in childhood, pairings remain fixed for life. Synesthetes inherit a biological
propensity for hyperconnecting brain neurons, but then must be exposed to cultural
artifacts, such as calendars, food names, and alphabets. The amazing thing is that a
single nucleotide change in the sequence of one's DNA alters perception. In this way,
synesthesia provides a path to understanding subjective differences, how two people can
see the same thing differently.

Take Sean, who prefers blue tasting food, such as milk, oranges, and spinach. The gene
heightens normally occurring connections between the taste area in his frontal lobe and
the color area further back. But suppose in someone else that the gene acted in
non-sensory areas. You would then have the ability to link seemingly unrelated things,
which is the definition of metaphor, seeing the similar in the dissimilar. Not
surprisingly, synesthesia is more common in artists who excel at making metaphors, like
novelist Vladimir Nabokov, painter David Hockney, and composers Billy Joel and Lady Gaga.
But why do the rest of us non-synesthetes understand metaphors like "sharp cheese" or
"sweet person"? It so happens that sight, sound, and movement already map to one another
so closely, that even bad ventriloquists convince us that the dummy is talking. Movies,
likewise, can convince us that the sound is coming from the actors' mouths rather than
surrounding speakers.

So, inwardly, we're all synesthetes, outwardly unaware of the perceptual couplings
happening all the time. Cross-talk in the brain is the rule, not the exception. And that
sounds like a sweet deal to me!
