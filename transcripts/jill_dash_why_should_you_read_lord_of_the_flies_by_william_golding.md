William Golding was losing his faith in humanity. Serving aboard a British destroyer in
World War II, the philosophy teacher turned Royal Navy lieutenant was constantly
confronted by the atrocities of his fellow man. And when he returned to England to find
Cold War superpowers threatening one another with nuclear annihilation, he was forced to
interrogate the very roots of human nature. These musings on the inevitability of
violence would inspire his first and most famous novel: "Lord of the Flies."After being
rejected by 21 publishers, the novel was finally published in 1954. It takes its title
from Beelzebub, a demon associated with pride and war— two themes very much at the heart
of Golding’s book. The novel was a bleak satire of a classic island adventure story, a
popular genre where young boys get shipwrecked in exotic locations. The protagonists in
these stories are able to master nature while evading the dangers posed by their new
environments.

The genre also endorsed the problematic colonialist narrative found in many British works
at the time, in which the boys teach the island’s native inhabitants their allegedly
superior British values. Golding’s satire even goes so far as to explicitly use the
setting and character names from R.M. Ballantyne’s "Coral Island"— one of the most beloved
 island adventure novels. But while Ballantyne’s book promised readers "pleasure...
profit... and unbounded amusement,” Golding’s had darker things in store."Lord of the
Flies" opens with the boys already on the island, but snippets of conversation hint at
their terrifying journey— their plane had been shot down in the midst of an unspecified
nuclear war. The boys, ranging in age from 6 to 13, are strangers to each other. All
except for a choir, clad in black uniforms and led by a boy named Jack. Just as in
Ballantyne’s "Coral Island," the boy’s new home appears to be a paradise— with fresh
water, shelter, and abundant food sources.

But even from the novel’s opening pages, a macabre darkness hangs over this seemingly
tranquil situation. The boys’ shadows are compared to “black, bat-like creatures” while
the choir itself first appears as “something dark... fumbling along” the beach. Within
hours of their arrival, the boys are already trading terrifying rumors of a vicious
“beastie” lurking in the woods. From these ominous beginnings, Golding’s narrative reveals 
how quickly cooperation unravels without the presence of an adult authority. Initially,
the survivors try to establish some sense of order. A boy named Ralph blows into a conch
shell to assemble the group, and delegate tasks. But as Jack vies for leadership with
Ralph, the group splinters and the boys submit to their darker urges. The mob of children
soon forgets their plans for rescue, silences the few voices of reason, and blindly
follows Jack to the edge of the island, and the edge of sanity. The novel’s universal
themes of morality, civility, and society have made it a literary classic, satirizing
both conventions of its time and long held beliefs about humanity.

While island adventure stories often support colonialism, "Lord of the Flies" turns this
trope on its head. Rather than cruelly casting native populations as stereotypical
savages, Golding transforms his angelic British schoolboys into savage caricatures. And
as the boys fight their own battle on the island, the far more destructive war that
brought them there continues off the page. Even if the boys were to be rescued from
themselves, what kind of world would they be returning to? With so few references to
anchor the characters in a specific place or period, the novel feels truly timeless— an
examination of human nature at its most bare. And though not all readers may agree with
Golding’s grim view, "Lord of the Flies" is unsettling enough to challenge even the most 
determined optimist.
