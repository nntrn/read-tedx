title: A fascinating time capsule of human feelings toward AI
speaker: Lucy Farey-Jones
description: >-
 How comfortable are you with robots taking over your life? Covering a wide range
 of potential applications -- from the mundane (robot house cleaner) to the
 mischievous (robot sex partner) to the downright macabre (uploading your brain to
 live on after death) -- technology strategist Lucy Farey-Jones shares data-backed
 evidence of how our willingness to accept AI may be radically changing.

I'm here, because I've spent far too many nights lying awake, worrying and wondering who
wins in the end. Is it humans or is it robots? You see, as a technology strategist, my job
involves behavior change: understanding why and how people adopt new technologies. And
that means I'm really frustrated that I know I won't live to see how this all ends up. And
in fact, if the youngest person watching this is 14 and the oldest, a robust 99, then
together, our collective consciousnesses span just 185 years. That is a myopic pinprick of
time when you think of the evolution and the story of life on this planet. Turns out we're
all in the cheap seats and none of us will live to see how it all pans out. So at my
company, we wanted a way around this. We wanted to see if there was a way to cantilever
out, beyond our fixed temporal vantage point, to get a sense of how it all shakes up. And
to do this, we conducted a study amongst 1,200 Americans representative of the US census,
in which we asked a battery of attitudinal questions around robotics and AI and also
captured behavioral ones around technology adoption. We had a big study so that we could
analyze differences in gender and generations, between religious and political beliefs,
even job function and personality trait.

It is a fascinating, time-bound time capsule of our human frailty in this predawn of the
robotic era. And I have five minutes to tell you about it. The first thing you should know
is that we brainstormed a list of scenarios of current and potential AI robotics. They ran
the spectrum from the mundane, so, a robot house cleaner, anyone? Through to the
mischievous, the idea of a robot pet sitter, or maybe a robot lawyer, or maybe a sex
partner. Through to the downright macabre, the idea of being a cyborg, blending human and
robot, or uploading your brain so it could live on after your death. And we plotted
people's comfort levels with these various scenarios. There were actually 31 in the study,
but for ease, I'm going to show you just a few of them here. The first thing you'll notice,
of course, is the sea of red. America is very uncomfortable with this stuff. That's why we
call it the discomfort index, not the comfort index. There were only two things the
majority of America is OK with.

And that's the idea of a robot AI house cleaner and a robot AI package deliverer, so Dyson
and Amazon, you guys should talk. There's an opportunity there. It seems we're ready to
off-load our chores to our robot friends. We're kind of definitely on the fence when it
comes to services, so robot AI lawyer or a financial adviser, maybe. But we're firmly
closed to the idea of robot care, whether it be a nurse, a doctor, child care. So from
this, you'd go, "It's OK, Lucy, you know what? Go back to sleep, stop worrying, the humans
win in the end." But actually not so fast. If you look at my data very closely, you can see
we're more vulnerable than we think. AI has a branding problem. So of those folks who said
that they would absolutely reject the idea of a personal assistant, 45 percent of them
had, in fact, one in their pockets, in terms of a device with Alexa, Google or Siri. One
in five of those who were against the idea of AI matchmaking had of course, you guessed
it, done online dating.

And 80 percent of those of us who refuse the idea of boarding an autonomous plane with a
pilot backup had in fact, just like me to get here to Vancouver, flown commercial. Lest you
think everybody was scared, though, here are the marvelous folk in the middle. These are
the neutrals. These are people for whom you say, "OK, robot friend," and they're like,
"Hm, robot friend. Maybe." Or, "AI pet," and they go, "Never say never." And as any decent
political operative knows, flipping the ambivalent middle can change the game. Another
reason I know we're vulnerable is men â€” I'm sorry, but men, you are twice as likely than
women to believe that getting into an autonomous car is a good idea, that uploading your
brain for posterity is fun, and two and a half times more likely to believe that becoming
a cyborg is cool, and for this, I blame Hollywood.

And this is where I want you to look around the theater and know that one in four men are
OK with the idea of sex with a robot. That goes up to 44 percent of millennial men
compared to just one in 10 women, which I think puts a whole new twist on the complaint of
mechanical sex.

Even more astounding than that though, to be honest, is this behavioral difference. So
here we have people who have a device with a voice assistant in it, so a smart speaker, a
home hub or a smart phone, versus those who don't. And you can see from this graph that
the Trojan horse is already in our living room. And as these devices proliferate and our
collective defenses soften, we all see how it can end. In fact, this may be as good a time
as any to admit I did take my Alexa Dot on vacation with me. Final finding I have time for
is generational. So look at the difference just three generations make. This is the leap
from silent to boomer to millennial. And what's more fascinating than this is if you
extrapolate this out, the same rate of change, just the same pace, not the accelerated one
I actually believe will be the case, the same pace, then it is eight generations away when
we hear every single American thinking the majority of these things here are
normal.

So the year 2222 is an astounding place where everything here is mainstream. And lest you
needed any more convincing, here is the generation's "excitement level with AI." So not
surprisingly, the youngest of us are more excited. But, and possibly the most paradoxical
finding of my career, when I asked these people my 3am question, "Who wins in the end?"
Guess what. The more excited you are about AI and robotics, the more likely you are to say
it's the robots. And I don't think we need a neural net running pattern-recognition
software to see where this is all headed. We are the proverbial frogs in boiling water. So
if the robots at TED2222 are watching this for posterity, could you send a cyborg, dig me
up and tell me if I was right?

Thank you.
