Amber Galloway-Gallego: OK, hi. I'm a sign-language interpreter that specializes in music
interpreting. And you're probably wondering why Deaf people would attend concerts, but
actually, music is so much more than sound simply traveling through the ear. See, Deaf
people experience music, just in a different way. For example, my friend Lisa, she cuts
her hair a certain length, so she feels the vibrations of sound in the music. And music
has psychological effects on us. It invokes feelings of nostalgia, happiness, sadness,
falling in love. It makes you have a feeling of connectedness, and unfortunately, Deaf and
hard-of-hearing people are excluded from these events, because obtaining a sign-language
interpreter is so difficult and so overwhelming that they simply don't buy the tickets or
they just give up, and this is not OK. We have to make everything accessible. So, myself, I
am a sign-language interpreter, so what I have to do is I have to take music and bring it
to life.

In doing that, I become a bridge between the hearing world and the Deaf world, making sure
that I'm representing music and the artistry of what music represents. Now, this is a lot
of work, OK? For a regular set that might be 12 songs, myself and a team, we have to study
over 30 songs or more for one set and hope and pray we have the right setlist. But you know
what? You know what the reward is? Looking down in the audience and seeing Deaf and
hard-of-hearing members, all of those people dancing and jamming out and feeling included
in that music experience. For myself, I'm a part of this cultural and linguistic
community, and we all communicate in different ways. Some of us sign and voice, some of us
just sign, but no one way is superior to the other. But you know what? Those with hearing
loss face daily battles to communication access, and those barriers are put up daily for
them. And music shouldn't be one of them.

So along with Madame Gandhi and myself today, let's break down those barriers.(Applause
and cheers)(Music: "Top Knot Turn Up")

Madame Gandhi: This is a song about getting the work done. Hair up in a bun that's the most
fun. Hearing myself think when I go for a runor maybe I'm practicing the drumsor maybe I'm
writing in the sun,the takeaway point is I'm talking to no one. Protecting my vibes that
are wholesome,trying my best to solve actual problems. If you want to hang with methen you
have to roll up your sleeves and work with me. This ain't no time to come flirt with
me;pipelines and drills are destroying the earth, you see. I cannot stand all the constant
misogyny. Tie my hair back so there ain't nothing stopping me. Top knot turn up. It's a top
knot turn up. Top knot turn up, turn up, turn up —about getting the work done. Top knot turn
up, turn up, turn up. It's a top knot turn up. Top knot turn up, eh.

Tie up and tie up your hairand throw back those curls. So tie up and tie up and tie up your
hairand throw back those curls, uh ...Throw back those curls,throw back and throw back and
throw back those curls, uh ...

(Percussion and beatboxing)I turned off my phone's notifications,so I have more time. No
bubbles to trouble my clear state of mind. One thing to know, I'm not here to please. Hair
tied back, I do it properly. My time is not your propertywhen I'm productive like my
ovaries. Eh, give a grown girl room to breathe, basic rights and her liberty. Free from
insecurity that the world's projecting onto me. Please do not trouble me when I am
focused. The future is female, you already know this. I'm fighting against the corruption on
SCOTUS,upping my top knot since when I first wrote this. Eh ...It's a top knot turn up. Top
knot turn up, turn up, turn up —about getting the work done. Top knot turn up, turn up,
turn up. It's a top knot turn up. Top knot turn up, ay.

Tie up and tie up and tie up your hair,throw back those curls. Tie up and tie up your
hair,throw back those curls, uh ...Throw back those curls,throw back and throw back and
throw back those curls.

Amber G.(Applause and cheers)Top knot turn up.(Music and applause)Madame
Gandhi.

(Applause and cheers)(Music ends)(Applause and cheers)Amber, it's such a pleasure to share
this stage with you, and to make my music accessible to an audience who might be hard of
hearing or Deaf and otherwise might not be able to be included in my music. And it really
wasn't until this collaboration that I had thought of the fact that though I work so much
in diversity and inclusion, that my music may not be reaching as many people as it could
be. I grew up in New York City, playing the drums, listening to Nas, Lauryn Hill, Thievery
Corporation, TV on the Radio, the Spice Girls —And for me, music was truth. Music was my
perspective into somebody else's point of view, into storytelling, into understanding how
the world works. And yet at the same time, I felt like there was such a disconnect between
the way that I understood my own very multidimensional sense of my gender identity and the
very two-dimensional way that women and femmes were often portrayed in the
media.

As I moved through my life, I went on to study mathematics and women's studies at
Georgetown. I was the first-ever data analyst at Interscope Records. I toured the world
playing the drums for M.I.A. And I did my MBA at Harvard, all with the intention of being
able to make a difference in the music industry and move the needle on gender equality
from the business side. But it was only until three years ago, when I ran the London
Marathon bleeding freely on my cycle to combat the global menstrual stigma that women face
every day all around the world, that I realized that I have a message, and that the most
effective way that I can convey my message was through my music. And why music? Because
music caters to the emotions. Music is joyful. Music pulls you in with the beat and the
rhythm and the melodies. The music pulls you in via the community aspect of it. And music
allows you to access somebody else's truth.

In the music I listen to today, sometimes I'm like, wow, I love the rhythm so much, but
the message is so misogynist, it's tough to work out to our run to or do whatever it is
that I'm trying to do. I oftentimes say, "I'm not here trying to turn up to the sound of
my own oppression." You feel me?(Laughter and cheers)So I'm here to build the alternative
instead. In my work, I talk often about the notion that the future is female. That we can
actually look to the femme archetype and derive alternative styles of leadership that
might encourage, instead, collaboration, emotional intelligence and building a world that
is linked and not ranked. And so for anyone watching or listening and experiencing this
talk today, I encourage you to consider the blind spots in your work and what partnerships
or collaborations you can do to be able to make your work have even greater of an
impact. This next song is called "Bad Habits," and it's about being an even better version
of yourself.(Percussion and beatboxing)

I had run out of time,I had done lost my mind,I had run out of time,I had done lost my
mind. I didn't knowwhy. I didn't know. I been so pressed that I don't even knowwhat's
bothering me. All my bad habits have go to, got to goentirely. It's my year to be freefrom
what's bothering me. It's this societythat's killing me. All my bad habits have got to, go
to go. All my bad habits have got to, got to go. All my bad habits have got to, got to
go. Yeah. All my bad habits have got to, got to go. Turn with me.

Ready? Clap with me.(Audience claps)Now listen.

Fela Kuti in the 1970sinspires me. All he wanted was his people to be freefrom the
colony,like Mahatma Gandhi in the 1940s. I've been reading about women's historyin the
1920s,thinking about how I could be so much better. Thinking about all the tears I've
cried. Thinking about how we could be so much better. Thinking about all the tears we've
cried.

Yes. All my bad habits have got to, got to go. All my bad habits have got to, got to go. All
my bad habits have got to, got to go. All my bad habits have got to, got to go. All my bad
habits have got to, got to go. All my bad habits have got to, got to go. All my bad habits
have got to, got to go. All my bad habits have got to, got to go.(Music ends)(Applause and
cheers)Thank you.(Applause and cheers)
