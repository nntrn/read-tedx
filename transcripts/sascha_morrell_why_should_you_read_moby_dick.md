speaker: Sascha Morrell
description: >-
 A mountain separating two lakes. A room papered floor to ceiling with bridal
 satins. The lid of an immense snuffbox. These seemingly unrelated images take us
 on a tour of a sperm whale's head in Herman Melville's "Moby Dick." Though the
 book features pirates, typhoons, high-speed chases, and giant squid, it's
 anything but a conventional seafaring adventure. Sascha Morrell digs into the

A mountain separating two lakes. A room papered floor to ceiling with bridal satins. The
lid of an immense snuffbox. These seemingly unrelated images take us on a tour of a sperm
whale’s head in Herman Melville’s "Moby Dick." On the surface, the book is the story of
Captain Ahab’s hunt for revenge against Moby Dick, the white whale who bit off his leg.
But though the book features pirates, typhoons, high-speed chases, and giant squid, you
shouldn’t expect a conventional seafaring adventure. Instead, it’s a multilayered
exploration of not only the intimate details of life aboard a whaling ship, but also
subjects from across human and natural history, by turns playful and tragic, humorous,
and urgent. The narrator guiding us through these explorations is a common sailor called
Ishmael. Ishmael starts out telling his own story as he prepares to escape the “damp and
drizzly November in [his] soul” by going to sea.

But after he befriends the Pacific Islander Queequeg and joins Ahab’s crew aboard the
Pequod, Ishmael becomes more of an omniscient guide for the reader than a traditional
character. While Ahab obsesses over revenge and first mate Starbuck tries to reason with
him, Ishmael takes us on his own quest for meaning throughout “the whole universe, not
excluding its suburbs.” In his telling, life’s biggest questions loom large, even in the
smallest details. Like his narrator, Melville was a restless and curious spirit, who
gained an unorthodox education working as a sailor on a series of grueling voyages around
the world in his youth. He published "Moby Dick" in 1851, when the United States’ whaling
industry was at its height. Nantucket, where the Pequod sets sail, was the epicenter of
this lucrative and bloody global industry which decimated the world’s whale
populations. Unusually for his time, Melville doesn’t shy away from the ugly side of this
industry, even taking the whale’s perspective at one point, when he speculates on how
terrifying the huge shadows of the ships must be to the creature swimming
below.

The author’s first-hand familiarity with whaling is evident over and over again in
Ishmael’s vivid descriptions. In one chapter, the skin of a whale’s penis becomes
protective clothing for a crewman. Chapters with titles as unpromising as “Cistern and
Buckets” become some of the novel’s most rewarding as Ishmael compares bailing out a
sperm-whale’s head to midwifery, which leads to reflections on Plato. Tangling whale-lines
provoke witty reflections on the “ever-present perils” entangling all mortals. He draws
on diverse branches of knowledge, like zoology, gastronomy, law, economics, mythology, and
teachings from a range of religious and cultural traditions. The book experiments with
writing style as much as subject matter. In one monologue, Ahab challenges Moby Dick in
Shakespearean style: “Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to
the last I grapple with thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit 
my last breath at thee.” One chapter is written as a playscript, where members of the
Pequod’s multi-ethnic crew chime in individually and in chorus.

African and Spanish sailors trade insults while a Tahitian seaman longs for home, Chinese
and Portuguese crewmembers call for a dance, and one young boy prophesies disaster. In
another chapter, Ishmael sings the process of decanting whale oil in epic style, as the
ship pitches and rolls in the midnight sea and the casks rumble like landslides. A book so
wide-ranging has something for everyone. Readers have found religious and political
allegory, existential enquiry, social satire, economic analysis, and representations of
American imperialism, industrial relations and racial conflict. As Ishmael chases meaning 
and Ahab chases the white whale, the book explores the opposing forces of optimism and
uncertainty, curiosity and fear that characterize human existence no matter what it is
we’re chasing. Through "Moby Dick’s" many pages, Melville invites his readers to leap
into the unknown, to join him on the hunt for the “ungraspable phantom of
life.”
