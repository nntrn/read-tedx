Mother Earth: Our end was imminent yet finality relented. Wind, water and fire gently
revived; you and I reconciled, rhythms realigned, the blues gone green. Your care in
conserving in exchange for my fruit and replenishing this picturous restoring of painted
skies, mountains rolling, forest covering — no more warming. The purity and simplicity of
how we used to be. You remember me? All I give to humanity? Housing, land, seas, birds,
beast and all of mankind, exclusively the interface where you and the elements meet and
vibrate harmoniously.(Piano plays)(Violin plays)

My beauty altered, muddied waters, fields stripped bare, interior scarred beyond repair,
our memories eroding. You once obsessed over my frame and how I came to be; my nature, its
polarity — how my sweet winds whisper softly, yet assault seas. You remember me? All I give
to humanity? Housing, land, seas, birds, beast and all of mankind — exclusively the
interface where you and the elements meet and vibrate harmoniously. The unseen traveler
forever passing, carrying life, moving, awning of earth felt and heard, strong and
stirring, blowing. Breathe you in, cleansing wind, gentle and still, quieter. The source
eternally here, ascent and descending: air. Rhythmic flow, fluid and graceful, waves of
serenity, smooth strings of purity, rains replenishing rapidly, rivers of dreams, raging
springs covering earth in abundance, universal solvent dissolving, drink, liquid, life and
power: water. Born when the universe was formed, warmed mankind, gave him light, colored
rays illuminate ember flickers incandescent, powerful and brilliant.

Sacred son of air, father of fury, heat dancing vigorously between perfection and beauty.
Unconfined agility, fast and fancy, sparks of ingenuity rise: fire.(Canku One Star
