title: The chemistry of cookies
speaker: Stephanie Warren
description: >-
 You stick cookie dough into an oven, and magically, you get a plate of warm,
 gooey cookies. Except it's not magic; it's science. Stephanie Warren explains via
 basic chemistry principles how the dough spreads out, at what temperature we can
 kill salmonella, and why that intoxicating smell wafting from your oven indicates
 that the cookies are ready for eating. [Directed by Augenblick Studios, narrated
 by Addison Anderson].

In a time-lapse video, it looks like a monster coming alive. For a moment, it sits there
innocuously. Then, ripples move across its surface. It bulges outwards, bursting with
weird boils. It triples in volume. Its color darkens ominously, and its surface hardens
into an alien topography of peaks and craters. Then, the kitchen timer dings. Your cookie
is ready. What happened inside that oven? Don't let the apron deceive you! Bakers are mad
scientists. When you slide the pan into the oven, you're setting off a series of chemical
reactions that transform one substance, dough, into another, cookies. When the dough
reaches 92 degrees Fahrenheit, the butter inside melts, causing the dough to start
spreading out. Butter is an emulsion, or mixture of two substances that don't want to stay
together, in this case, water and fat, along with some dairy solids that help hold them
together. As the butter melts, its trapped water is released.

And as the cookie gets hotter, the water expands into steam. It pushes against the dough
from the inside, trying to escape through the cookie walls like Ridley Scott's
chest-bursting alien. Your eggs may have been home to squirming salmonella bacteria. An
estimated 142,000 Americans are infected this way each year. Though salmonella can live
for weeks outside a living body and even survive freezing, 136 degrees is too hot for
them. When your dough reaches that temperature, they die off. You'll live to test your
fate with a bite of raw dough you sneak from your next batch. At 144 degrees, changes
begin in the proteins, which come mostly from the eggs in your dough. Eggs are composed of
dozens of different kinds of proteins, each sensitive to a different temperature. In an
egg fresh from the hen, these proteins look like coiled up balls of string. When they're
exposed to heat energy, the protein strings unfold and get tangled up with their
neighbors.

This linked structure makes the runny egg nearly solid, giving substance to squishy dough.
Water boils away at 212 degrees, so like mud baking in the sun, your cookie gets dried out
and it stiffens. Cracks spread across its surface. The steam that was bubbling inside
evaporates, leaving behind airy pockets that make the cookie light and flaky. Helping this
along is your leavening agent, sodium bicarbonate, or baking soda. The sodium bicarbonate
reacts with acids in the dough to create carbon dioxide gas, which makes airy pockets in
your cookie. Now, it's nearly ready for a refreshing dunk in a cool glass of milk. One of
science's tastiest reactions occurs at 310 degrees. This is the temperature for Maillard
reactions. Maillard reactions result when proteins and sugars break down and rearrange
themselves, forming ring-like structures, which reflect light in a way that gives foods
like Thanksgiving turkey and hamburgers their distinctive, rich brown color.

As this reaction occurs, it produces a range of flavor and aroma compounds, which also
react with each other, forming even more complex tastes and smells. Caramelization is the
last reaction to take place inside your cookie. Caramelization is what happens when sugar
molecules break down under high heat, forming the sweet, nutty, and slightly bitter flavor
compounds that define, well, caramel. And, in fact, if your recipe calls for a 350 degree
oven, it'll never happen, since caramelization starts at 356 degrees. If your ideal cookie
is barely browned, like a Northeasterner on a beach vacation, you could have set your oven
to 310 degrees. If you like your cookies to have a nice tan, crank up the heat.
Caramelization continues up to 390 degrees. And here's another trick: you don't need that
kitchen timer; your nose is a sensitive scientific instrument. When you smell the nutty,
toasty aromas of the Maillard reaction and caramelization, your cookies are
ready.

Grab your glass of milk, put your feet up, and reflect that science can be pretty
sweet.
