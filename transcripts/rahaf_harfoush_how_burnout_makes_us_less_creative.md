 is making us less productive, says digital anthropologist Rahaf Harfoush. She
 explains why we need to redesign our workday around creativity -- not just
 efficiency.

A few years ago, my obsession with productivity got so bad that I suffered an episode of
burnout that scared the hell out of me. I'm talking insomnia, weight gain, hair loss — the
works. I was so overworked that my brain literally couldn't come up with another idea.
That indicated to me that my identity was linked with this idea of productivity.[The Way
We Work]Do you feel guilty if you haven't been productive enough during the day? Do you
spend hours reading productivity hacks, trying new frameworks and testing new apps to get
even more done? I've tried them all — task apps, calendar apps, time-management apps,
things that are meant to manage your day. We've been so obsessed with doing more that
we've missed the most important thing. Many of these tools aren't helping. They're making
things worse. OK, let's talk about productivity for a second. Historically, productivity as
we know it today was used during the industrial revolution.

It was a system that measured performance based on consistent output. You clocked into
your shift and were responsible for creating X number of widgets on the assembly line. At
the end of the day, it was pretty easy to see who worked hard and who hadn't. When we
shifted to a knowledge economy, people suddenly had tasks that were much more abstract,
things like writing, problem-solving or strategizing, tasks that weren't easy to measure.
Companies struggled to figure out how to tell who was working and who wasn't, so they just
adopted the old systems as best as they could, leading to things like the dreaded time
sheet where everyone is under pressure to justify how they spend every second of their
day. There's just one problem. These systems don't make a lot of sense for creative work.
We still think of productivity as an endurance sport. You try to churn out as many blog
posts or we cram our day full of meetings. But this model of constant output isn't
conducive to creative thought.

Today, knowledge workers are facing a big challenge. We're expected to be constantly
productive and creative in equal measure. But it's actually almost impossible for our
brains to continuously generate new ideas with no rest. In fact, downtime is a necessity
for our brain to recover and to operate properly. Consider that according to a team of
researchers from the University of Southern California, letting our minds wander is an
essential mental state that helps us develop our identity, process social interactions,
and it even influences our internal moral compass. Our need for a break flies in the face
of our cultural narrative about hustling, in other words, the stories that we as a society
tell each other about what success looks like and what it takes to get there. Stories like
the American Dream, which is one of our most deeply rooted beliefs. This tells us that if
we work hard, we'll be successful. But there's a flip side.

If you aren't successful, it must mean that you're not working hard enough. And if you
don't think you're doing enough, of course you're going to stay late, pull all-nighters
and push yourself hard even when you know better. Productivity has wrapped itself up in our
self-worth, so that it's almost impossible for us to allow ourselves to stop working. The
average US employee only takes half of their allocated paid vacation leave, further
proving that even if we have the option to take a break, we don't. To be clear, I don't
think that productivity or trying to improve our performance is bad. I'm just saying that
the current models we're using to measure our creative work don't make sense. We need
systems that work with our creativity and not against it.[SO HOW DO WE FIX IT?]There is no
quick fix for this problem. And I know, I know, that sucks. No one loves a good framework
or a good acronym better than me. But the truth is everyone has their own narratives that
they have to uncover.

It wasn't until I started digging around my own beliefs around work that I began to
unravel the root of my own work story, finally being able to let go of destructive
behaviors and make positive, long-lasting changes. And the only way to do that is by asking
yourself some hard questions. Does being busy make you feel valuable? Who do you hold up
as an example of success? Where did your ideas of work ethic come from? How much of who
you are is linked to what you do? Your creativity, it has its own rhythms. Our energy
fluctuates daily, weekly, even seasonally. I know that I'm always more energetic at the
beginning of the week than at the end, so I front-load my workweek to account for that
fact. As a proud night owl, I free up my afternoons and evenings for creative work. And I
know I'll get more writing done in the cozy winter months than during the summer. And
that's the secret. Dismantling myths, challenging your old views, identifying your
narratives — this is the real work that we need to be doing.

We aren't machines, and I think it's time that we stopped working like
one.
