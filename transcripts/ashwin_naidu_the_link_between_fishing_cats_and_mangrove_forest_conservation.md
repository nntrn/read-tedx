title: The link between fishing cats and mangrove forest conservation
speaker: Ashwin Naidu
description: >-
 Mangrove forests are crucial to the health of the planet, gobbling up CO2 from
 the atmosphere and providing a home for a diverse array of species. But these
 rich habitats are under continual threat from deforestation and industry. In an
 empowering talk, conservationist and TED Fellow Ashwin Naidu shares how
 community-driven efforts in South and Southeast Asia are working to protect
 mangroves -- all with a little help from the mysterious and endangered fishing
 cat.

(Imitates fishing cat)That's my impersonation of a fishing cat, which actually sounds more
like this.(Prerecorded fishing cat sounds)It's a cat that loves water, loves to fish, and
lives in some of the most unique and valuable ecosystems on earth: the wetlands and
mangrove forests of South and Southeast Asia. Aren't they fishing awesome?

Fishing cats are one of about 40 species of wildcats. Like tigers and lions, only much
smaller. They're probably around twice the size of our average domestic cat. In Indonesia,
people call them "kucing bakau," which literally translates to "the cat of the mangroves."
But I like to call them the tigers of the mangroves. Now, we don't know fishing cats as
well as we do tigers, but what we've learned is that these cats can be a flagship species
to a globally important ecosystem, and a visual bait attached to a strong line for
conservation. Are you hooked yet?

Like many endangered species, fishing cats are threatened by habitat loss, mainly because
of our international demand for farmed fish and shrimp, and the deforestation of nearly
half the historic mangrove cover in South and Southeast Asia. Mangroves, on the other
hand, are much more than just habitat to the fishing cat. They are home to a fantastic
array of species, like jackals, turtles, shorebirds and otters.

Mangroves also prevent soil erosion, and they can be the first line of defense between
storm surges, tsunamis and the millions of people who live next to these forests for their
day-to-day survival. The fact that puts the icing on the cake — or the earth, I should say
— is that mangroves can store upwards of five to ten times more carbon dioxide than
tropical forests. So protecting one acre of mangroves may well be like protecting five or
more acres of tropical forests. Would you like to eliminate you entire life's carbon
footprint? Well, mangroves can offer you one of the best bangs for your conservation
buck. Deforestation, extinction and climate change are all global problems that we can
solve by giving value to our species and ecosystems and by working together with the local
people who live next to them. This is one of three river deltas in coastal South India
where communities came together to change the face and potentially, the fate of this
planet.

In less than a decade, with international support, the state forest departments and the
local communities worked together to restore over 20,000 acres of unproductive fish and
shrimp farms back into mangroves. About five years ago, guess who we discovered in these
restored mangroves? When we shared images of these fishing cats with local people, we were
able to build pride among them about a globally revered endangered species and ecosystem
in their backyards. We were also able to build trust with some people to help them lead
alternative livelihoods. Meet Santosh, a 19-year-old boy who not only became a conservation
professional after working with us for just over a year but also went on to involve many
local fishermen in helping study and protect fishing cats. Meet Moshi, a tribal poacher,
who not only stopped hunting and became our most prized conservationist, but also used his
traditional knowledge to educate his entire community to stop hunting fishing cats, otters
and the many other threatened species that live in the mangroves in his backyard. Fish and
shrimp farmers, like Venkat, are now willing to work with us conservationists to test the
sustainable harvest of ecosystem services like crabs, and possibly even honey, from
mangroves.

Incentives that could get them to protect and plant mangroves where they have been lost. A
win-win-win for fishing cats, local people and the global community. These stories show us
that we can all be part of a future where fishing cats and the lost mangrove forests are
protected and restored by fishermen themselves, creating carbon sinks that can help offset
our ecological footprints. So while the fishing cat may be small, I hope that we've been
able to help make it a big deal. One that we can all invest in to help sustain our lives
on earth a little longer. Or as our friend here would say ...(Prerecorded fishing cat
sounds)Thank you.
