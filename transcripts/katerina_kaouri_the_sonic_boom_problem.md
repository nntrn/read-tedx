title: The sonic boom problem
speaker: Katerina Kaouri
description: >-
 Objects that fly faster than the speed of sound (like really fast planes) create
 a shock wave accompanied by a thunder-like noise: the sonic boom. These epic
 sounds can cause distress to people and animals and even damage nearby buildings.
 Katerina Kaouri details how scientists use math to predict sonic booms' paths in
 the atmosphere, where they will land, and how loud they will be. [Directed by
 Anton Bogaty, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Michael Dow].

Humans have been fascinated with speed for ages. The history of human progress is one of
ever-increasing velocity, and one of the most important achievements in this historical
race was the breaking of the sound barrier. Not long after the first successful airplane
flights, pilots were eager to push their planes to go faster and faster. But as they did
so, increased turbulence and large forces on the plane prevented them from accelerating
further. Some tried to circumvent the problem through risky dives, often with tragic
results. Finally, in 1947, design improvements, such as a movable horizontal stabilizer,
the all-moving tail, allowed an American military pilot named Chuck Yeager to fly the Bell
X-1 aircraft at 1127 km/h, becoming the first person to break the sound barrier and travel
faster than the speed of sound. The Bell X-1 was the first of many supersonic aircraft to
follow, with later designs reaching speeds over Mach 3.

Aircraft traveling at supersonic speed create a shock wave with a thunder-like noise known
as a sonic boom, which can cause distress to people and animals below or even damage
buildings. For this reason, scientists around the world have been looking at sonic booms,
trying to predict their path in the atmosphere, where they will land, and how loud they
will be. To better understand how scientists study sonic booms, let's start with some
basics of sound. Imagine throwing a small stone in a still pond. What do you see? The
stone causes waves to travel in the water at the same speed in every direction. These
circles that keep growing in radius are called wave fronts. Similarly, even though we
cannot see it, a stationary sound source, like a home stereo, creates sound waves
traveling outward. The speed of the waves depends on factors like the altitude and
temperature of the air they move through. At sea level, sound travels at about 1225
km/h.

But instead of circles on a two-dimensional surface, the wave fronts are now concentric
spheres, with the sound traveling along rays perpendicular to these waves. Now imagine a
moving sound source, such as a train whistle. As the source keeps moving in a certain
direction, the successive waves in front of it will become bunched closer together. This
greater wave frequency is the cause of the famous Doppler effect, where approaching
objects sound higher pitched. But as long as the source is moving slower than the sound
waves themselves, they will remain nested within each other. It's when an object goes
supersonic, moving faster than the sound it makes, that the picture changes dramatically.
As it overtakes sound waves it has emitted, while generating new ones from its current
position, the waves are forced together, forming a Mach cone. No sound is heard as it
approaches an observer because the object is traveling faster than the sound it
produces.

Only after the object has passed will the observer hear the sonic boom. Where the Mach
cone meets the ground, it forms a hyperbola, leaving a trail known as the boom carpet as
it travels forward. This makes it possible to determine the area affected by a sonic boom.
What about figuring out how strong a sonic boom will be? This involves solving the famous
Navier-Stokes equations to find the variation of pressure in the air due to the supersonic
aircraft flying through it. This results in the pressure signature known as the N-wave.
What does this shape mean? Well, the sonic boom occurs when there is a sudden change in
pressure, and the N-wave involves two booms: one for the initial pressure rise at the
aircraft's nose, and another for when the tail passes, and the pressure suddenly returns
to normal. This causes a double boom, but it is usually heard as a single boom by human
ears. In practice, computer models using these principles can often predict the location
and intensity of sonic booms for given atmospheric conditions and flight trajectories, and
there is ongoing research to mitigate their effects.

In the meantime, supersonic flight over land remains prohibited. So, are sonic booms a
recent creation? Not exactly. While we try to find ways to silence them, a few other
animals have been using sonic booms to their advantage. The gigantic Diplodocus may have
been capable of cracking its tail faster than sound, at over 1200 km/h, possibly to deter
predators. Some types of shrimp can also create a similar shock wave underwater, stunning
or even killing pray at a distance with just a snap of their oversized claw. So while we
humans have made great progress in our relentless pursuit of speed, it turns out that
nature was there first.
