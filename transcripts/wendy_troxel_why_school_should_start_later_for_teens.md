title: Why school should start later for teens
speaker: Wendy Troxel
description: >-
 Teens don't get enough sleep, and it's not because of Snapchat, social lives or
 hormones -- it's because of public policy, says Wendy Troxel. Drawing from her
 experience as a sleep researcher, clinician and mother of a teenager, Troxel
 discusses how early school start times deprive adolescents of sleep during the
 time of their lives when they need it most.

It's six o'clock in the morning, pitch black outside. My 14-year-old son is fast asleep in
his bed, sleeping the reckless, deep sleep of a teenager. I flip on the light and
physically shake the poor boy awake, because I know that, like ripping off a Band-Aid,
it's better to get it over with quickly.

I have a friend who yells "Fire!" just to rouse her sleeping teen. And another who got so
fed up that she had to dump cold water on her son's head just to get him out of bed. Sound
brutal ... but perhaps familiar? Every morning I ask myself, "How can I — knowing what I
know and doing what I do for a living — be doing this to my own son?" You see, I'm a sleep
researcher.

So I know far too much about sleep and the consequences of sleep loss. I know that I'm
depriving my son of the sleep he desperately needs as a rapidly growing teenager. I also
know that by waking him up hours before his natural biological clock tells him he's ready,
I'm literally robbing him of his dreams — the type of sleep most associated with learning,
memory consolidation and emotional processing. But it's not just my kid that's being
deprived of sleep. Sleep deprivation among American teenagers is an epidemic. Only about
one in 10 gets the eight to 10 hours of sleep per night recommended by sleep scientists
and pediatricians. Now, if you're thinking to yourself, "Phew, we're doing good, my kid's
getting eight hours," remember, eight hours is the minimum recommendation. You're barely
passing. Eight hours is kind of like getting a C on your report card. There are many
factors contributing to this epidemic, but a major factor preventing teens from getting
the sleep they need is actually a matter of public policy.

Not hormones, social lives or Snapchat. Across the country, many schools are starting
around 7:30am or earlier, despite the fact that major medical organizations recommend that
middle and high school start no earlier than 8:30am. These early start policies have a
direct effect on how much — or really how little sleep American teenagers are
getting. They're also pitting teenagers and their parents in a fundamentally unwinnable
fight against their own bodies. Around the time of puberty, teenagers experience a delay
in their biological clock, which determines when we feel most awake and when we feel most
sleepy. This is driven in part by a shift in the release of the hormone melatonin.
Teenagers' bodies wait to start releasing melatonin until around 11pm, which is two hours
later than what we see in adults or younger children. This means that waking a teenager up
at 6am is the biological equivalent of waking an adult up at 4am.

On the unfortunate days when I have to wake up at 4am, I'm a zombie. Functionally useless.
I can't think straight, I'm irritable, and I probably shouldn't be driving a car. But this
is how many American teenagers feel every single school day. In fact, many of the, shall
we say, unpleasant characteristics that we chalk up to being a teenager — moodiness,
irritability, laziness, depression — could be a product of chronic sleep deprivation. For
many teens battling chronic sleep loss, their go-to strategy to compensate is consuming
large quantities of caffeine in the form of venti frappuccinos, or energy drinks and
shots. So essentially, we've got an entire population of tired but wired youth. Advocates
of sleep-friendly start times know that adolescence is a period of dramatic brain
development, particularly in the parts of the brain that are responsible for those higher
order thinking processes, including reasoning, problem-solving and good
judgment.

In other words, the very type of brain activity that's responsible for reining in those
impulsive and often risky behaviors that are so characteristic of adolescence and that are
so terrifying to us parents of teenagers. They know that like the rest of us, when
teenagers don't get the sleep they need, their brains, their bodies and behaviors suffer
with both immediate and lasting effects. They can't concentrate, their attention plummets
and many will even show behavioral signs that mimic ADHD.But the consequences of teen
sleep loss go well beyond the classroom, sadly contributing to many of the mental health
problems that skyrocket during adolescence, including substance use, depression and
suicide. In our work with teens from LA Unified School District, we found that teens with
sleep problems were 55 percent more likely to have used alcohol in the past month. In
another study with over 30,000 high school students, they found that for each hour of lost
sleep, there was a 38 percent increase in feeling sad or hopeless, and a 58 percent
increase in teen suicide attempts.

And if that's not enough, teens who skip out on sleep are at increased risk for a host of
physical health problems that plague our country, including obesity, heart disease and
diabetes. Then there's the risk of putting a sleep-deprived teen, with a newly minted
driver's license, behind the wheel. Studies have shown that getting five hours or less of
sleep per night is the equivalent of driving with a blood alcohol content above the legal
limit. Advocates of sleep-friendly start times, and researchers in this area, have produced
tremendous science showing the tremendous benefits of later start times. The findings are
unequivocal, and as a sleep scientist, I rarely get to speak with that kind of certainty.
Teens from districts with later start times get more sleep. To the naysayers who may think
that if schools start later, teens will just stay up later, the truth is, their bedtimes
stay the same, but their wake-up times get extended, resulting in more
sleep.

They're more likely to show up for school; school absences dropped by 25 percent in one
district. And they're less likely to drop out. Not surprisingly, they do better
academically. So this has real implications for reducing the achievement gap. Standardized
test scores in math and reading go up by two to three percentage points. That's as
powerful as reducing class sizes by one-third fewer students, or replacing a so-so teacher
in the classroom with a truly outstanding one. Their mental and physical health improves,
and even their families are happier. I mean, who wouldn't enjoy a little more pleasantness
from our teens, and a little less crankiness? Even their communities are safer because car
crash rates go down — a 70 percent reduction in one district. Given these tremendous
benefits, you might think, well, this is a no-brainer, right? So why have we as a society
failed to heed this call?

Often the argument against later start times goes something like this: "Why should we
delay start times for teenagers? We need to toughen them up so they're ready for the real
world!" But that's like saying to the parent of a two-year-old, "Don't let Johnny nap, or
he won't be ready for kindergarten."

Delaying start times also presents many logistical challenges. Not just for students and
their families, but for communities as a whole. Updating bus routes, increased
transportation costs, impact on sports, care before or after school. These are the same
concerns that come up in district after district, time and again around the country as
school start times are debated. And they're legitimate concerns, but these are problems we
have to work through. They are not valid excuses for failing to do the right thing for our
children, which is to start middle and high schools no earlier than 8:30am. And in
districts around the country, big and small, who have made this change, they found that
these fears are often unfounded and far outweighed by the tremendous benefits for student
health and performance, and our collective public safety. So tomorrow morning, when
coincidentally we get to set our clocks back by an hour and you get that delicious extra
hour of sleep, and the day seems a little longer, and a little more full of hope, think
about the tremendous power of sleep.

And think about what a gift it would be for our children to be able to wake up naturally,
in harmony with their own biology. Thank you, and pleasant dreams.
