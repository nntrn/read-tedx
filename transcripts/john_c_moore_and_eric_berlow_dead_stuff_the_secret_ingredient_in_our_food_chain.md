title: Dead stuff: The secret ingredient in our food chain
speaker: John C. Moore and Eric Berlow
description: >-
 When you picture the lowest levels of the food chain, you might imagine
 herbivores happily munching on lush, living green plants. But this idyllic image
 leaves out a huge (and slightly less appetizing) source of nourishment: dead
 stuff. John C. Moore details the "brown food chain," explaining how such unlikely
 delicacies as pond scum and animal poop contribute enormous amounts of energy to
 our ecosystems. [Directed by TED-Ed, narrated by George Zaidan].

If someone called you scum, you'd probably be offended, but scientifically, they might not
be far off. Have you ever thought about where your food comes from? You might say it comes
from plants, animals, or even fungi, but you'd probably rather not think about the rotting
organisms and poop that feed those plants, animals, and fungi. So really, you and most of
the matter in your body are just two or three degrees of separation from things like pond
scum. All species in an ecosystem, from the creatures in a coral reef to the fish in a
lake to the lions on the savannah, are directly or indirectly nourished by dead stuff.
Most of the organic matter in our bodies, if we trace it back far enough, comes from CO2
and water through photosynthesis. Plants use the energy from sunlight to transform carbon
dioxide and water from the environment into glucose and oxygen. That glucose is then
transformed into more complex organic molecules to form leaves, stems, roots, fruit, and
so on.

The energy stored in these organic molecules supports the food chains with which we're
familiar. You've probably seen illustrations like this or this. These green food chains
start with living plants at their base. But in real-life terrestrial ecosystems, less than
10% of plant matter is eaten while it's still alive. What about the other 90? Well, just
look at the ground on an autumn day. Living plants shed dead body parts: fallen leaves,
broken branches, and even underground roots. Many plants are lucky enough to go their
whole lives without being eaten, eventually dying and leaving remains. All of these
uneaten, undigested, and dead plant parts, that 90% of terrestrial plant matter? That
becomes detritus, the base of what we call the brown food chain, which looks more like
this. What happens to plants also happens to all other organisms up the food chain: some
are eaten alive, but most are eaten only when they're dead and rotting.

And all along this food chain, living things shed organic matter and expel digestive waste
before dying and leaving their remains to decay. All that death sounds grim, right? But
it's not. All detritus is ultimately consumed by microbes and other scavengers, so it
actually forms the base of the brown food chain that supports many other organisms,
including us. Scientists are learning that this detritus is an unexpectedly huge energy
source, fueling most natural ecosystems. But the interactions within an ecosystem are even
more complex than that. What a food chain really represents is a single pathway of energy
flow. And within any ecosystem, many of these flows are linked together to form a rich
network of interactions, or food web, with dead matter supporting that network at every
step. The resulting food web is so connected that almost every species is no more than two
degrees from detritus, even us humans.

You probably don't eat rotting things, poop, or pond scum directly, but your food sources
probably do. Many animals we eat either feed directly on detritus themselves, like pork,
poultry, mushrooms, shellfish, or catfish and other bottom feeders, or they are fed animal
by-products. So, if you're thinking nature is full of waste, you're right. But one
organism's garbage is another's gold, and all that rotting dead stuff ultimately provides
the energy that nourishes us and most of life on Earth, as it passes through the food web.
Now that's some food for thought.
