Lord Shiva— primordial destroyer of evil, slayer of demons, protector, and omniscient
observer of the universe— was testing his wife’s patience. Historically, the union between
 Shiva and Parvati was a glorious one. They maintained the equilibrium between thought
and action on which the well-being of the world depended. Without Parvati as the agent of
energy, growth, and transformation on Earth, Shiva would become a detached observer, and
the world would remain static. But together, the two formed a divine union known as
Ardhanarishvara–– a sacred combination which brought fertility and connection to all
living things. For these reasons, Parvati was worshipped far and wide as the mother of the
natural world–– and the essential counterpart to Shiva’s powers of raw creation. She
oversaw humanity’s material comforts; and ensured that the Earth’s inhabitants were bonded
to each other physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Yet a rift had grown between these
two formidable forces.

While Parvati sustained daily life with care and control, Shiva had begun to belittle 
his wife’s essential work— and insisted on quarreling about their roles in the universe.
He believed that Brahma, the Creator of the world, had conceived the material plane 
purely for his own fancy. And therefore, all material things were merely distractions
called māyā— nothing but a cosmic illusion. For millennia Parvati had merely smiled
knowingly as Shiva dismissed the things she nurtured. But upon His latest rebuke, she
knew she had to prove the importance of her work once and for all. She took flight from
the world, withdrawing her half of the cosmic energy that kept the Earth turning. At her
disappearance, a sudden, terrifying and all-encompassing scarcity enveloped the world in
eerie silence. Without Parvati, the land became dry and barren. Rivers shrank and crops
shriveled in the fields. Hunger descended on humanity.

Parents struggled to console their starving children while their own stomachs rumbled.
With nothing to eat, people no longer gathered over heaped bowls of rice, but withdrew and
shrank from the darkening world. To His shock and awe, Shiva also felt the profound
emptiness left by his wife’s absence. Despite His supreme power, He too realized that He
was not immune to the need for sustenance, and His yearning felt bottomless and
unbearable. As Shiva despaired over the desolate Earth, He came to realize that the
material world could not be so easily dismissed. At her husband’s epiphany, the
compassionate Parvati could no longer stand by and watch her devotees wasting away. To
walk among them and restore their health, she took the form of a new avatar, carrying a
golden bowl of porridge and armed with a jewel-encrusted ladle. As word of this hopeful
figure spread, she was worshipped as Annapurna, the Goddess of food. With the arrival of
Annapurna, the world blossomed anew.

People rejoiced at fertility and food, and communed together to give thanks. Some believe
that Annapurna first appeared in the sacred city of Kashi, or the Place of Freedom, on
the banks of the Ganges— where she opened a kitchen to fill the bellies of the people
until they could eat no more. But it was not only mere mortals who were served at her
feast. Humbled at the scenes of earthly pleasure blooming all around him, Lord Shiva
himself approached the goddess with an empty bowl and begged for food and forgiveness. For
this reason, the supreme deity is sometimes portrayed as a poor beggar at the mercy of
Annapurna; holding her golden bowl in her left hand, while the right forms the abhaya
mudra–– a gesture of safety and assurance. With these symbols, this powerful avatar makes
it clear that the material world is anything but an illusion. Rather, it is a cycle of
life that must be sustained— from the feeding of open mouths and rumbling bellies, to
the equilibrium of the Earth.
