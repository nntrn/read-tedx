title: Google's driverless car
speaker: Sebastian Thrun
description: >-
 Sebastian Thrun helped build Google's amazing driverless car, powered by a very
 personal quest to save lives and reduce traffic accidents. Jawdropping video
 shows the DARPA Challenge-winning car motoring through busy city traffic with no
 one behind the wheel, and dramatic test drive footage from TED2011 demonstrates
 how fast the thing can really go.

As a boy, I loved cars. When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident. Like
this. And then I decided I'd dedicate my life to saving one million people every year. Now
I haven't succeeded, so this is just a progress report, but I'm here to tell you a little
bit about self-driving cars. I saw the concept first in the DARPA Grand Challenges where
the U.S. government issued a prize to build a self-driving car that could navigate a
desert. And even though a hundred teams were there, these cars went nowhere. So we decided
at Stanford to build a different self-driving car. We built the hardware and the software.
We made it learn from us, and we set it free in the desert. And the unimaginable happened:
it became the first car to ever return from a DARPA Grand Challenge, winning Stanford 2
million dollars. Yet I still hadn't saved a single life. Since, our work has focused on
building driving cars that can drive anywhere by themselves — any street in
California.

We've driven 140,000 miles. Our cars have sensors by which they magically can see
everything around them and make decisions about every aspect of driving. It's the perfect
driving mechanism. We've driven in cities, like in San Francisco here. We've driven from
San Francisco to Los Angeles on Highway 1.We've encountered joggers, busy highways, toll
booths, and this is without a person in the loop; the car just drives itself. In fact,
while we drove 140,000 miles, people didn't even notice. Mountain roads, day and night,
and even crooked Lombard Street in San Francisco. 

Sometimes our cars get so crazy, they even do little stunts.

Man: Oh, my God. What? Second Man: It's driving itself. Sebastian Thrun: Now I can't get my
friend Harold back to life, but I can do something for all the people who died. Do you
know that driving accidents are the number one cause of death for young people? And do you
realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error, and can
therefore be prevented by machines? Do you realize that we could change the capacity of
highways by a factor of two or three if we didn't rely on human precision on staying in
the lane — improve body position and therefore drive a little bit closer together on a
little bit narrower lanes, and do away with all traffic jams on highways? Do you realize
that you, TED users, spend an average of 52 minutes per day in traffic, wasting your time
on your daily commute? You could regain this time. This is four billion hours wasted in
this country alone.

And it's 2.4 billion gallons of gasoline wasted. Now I think there's a vision here, a new
technology, and I'm really looking forward to a time when generations after us look back
at us and say how ridiculous it was that humans were driving cars. Thank
you.
