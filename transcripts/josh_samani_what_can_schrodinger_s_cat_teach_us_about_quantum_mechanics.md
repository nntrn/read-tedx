title: What can Schrödinger's cat teach us about quantum mechanics?
speaker: Josh Samani
description: >-
 The classical physics that we encounter in our everyday, macroscopic world is
 very different from the quantum physics that governs systems on a much smaller
 scale (like atoms). One great example of quantum physics' weirdness can be shown
 in the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. Josh Samani walks us through this
 experiment in quantum entanglement. [Directed by Dan Pinto, narrated by Addison
 Anderson].

Consider throwing a ball straight into the air. Can you predict the motion of the ball
after it leaves your hand? Sure, that's easy. The ball will move upward until it gets to
some highest point, then it will come back down and land in your hand again. Of course,
that's what happens, and you know this because you have witnessed events like this
countless times. You've been observing the physics of everyday phenomena your entire life.
But suppose we explore a question about the physics of atoms, like what does the motion of
an electron around the nucleus of a hydrogen atom look like? Could we answer that
question based on our experience with everyday physics? Definietly not. Why? Because the
physics that governs the behavior of systems at such small scales is much different than
the physics of the macroscopic objects you see around you all the time. The everyday world
you know and love behaves according to the laws of classical mechanics.

But systems on the scale of atoms behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics. This
quantum world turns out to be a very strange place. An illustration of quantum strangeness
is given by a famous thought experiment: Schrödinger's cat. A physicist, who doesn't
particularly like cats, puts a cat in a box, along with a bomb that has a 50% chance of
blowing up after the lid is closed. Until we reopen the lid, there is no way of knowing
whether the bomb exploded or not, and thus, no way of knowing if the cat is alive or dead.
In quantum physics, we could say that before our observation the cat was in a
superposition state. It was neither alive nor dead but rather in a mixture of both
possibilities, with a 50% chance for each. The same sort of thing happens to physical
systems at quantum scales, like an electron orbiting in a hydrogen atom. The electron
isn't really orbiting at all. It's sort of everywhere in space, all at once, with more of
a probability of being at some places than others, and it's only after we measure its
position that we can pinpoint where it is at that moment.

A lot like how we didn't know whether the cat was alive or dead until we opened the box.
This brings us to the strange and beautiful phenomenon of quantum entanglement. Suppose
that instead of one cat in a box, we have two cats in two different boxes. If we repeat
the Schrödinger's cat experiment with this pair of cats, the outcome of the experiment can
be one of four possibilities. Either both cats will be alive, or both will be dead, or one
will be alive and the other dead, or vice versa. The system of both cats is again in a
superposition state, with each outcome having a 25% chance rather than 50%. But here's the
cool thing: quantum mechanics tells us it's possible to erase the both cats alive and both
cats dead outcomes from the superposition state. In other words, there can be a two cat
system, such that the outcome will always be one cat alive and the other cat dead. The
technical term for this is that the states of the cats are entangled.

But there's something truly mindblowing about quantum entanglement. If you prepare the
system of two cats in boxes in this entangled state, then move the boxes to opposite ends
of the universe, the outcome of the experiment will still always be the same. One cat will
always come out alive, and the other cat will always end up dead, even though which
particular cat lives or dies is completely undetermined before we measure the outcome. How
is this possible? How is it that the states of cats on opposite sides of the universe can
be entangled in this way? They're too far away to communicate with each other in time, so
how do the two bombs always conspire such that one blows up and the other doesn't? You
might be thinking, "This is just some theoretical mumbo jumbo. This sort of thing can't
happen in the real world." But it turns out that quantum entanglement has been confirmed
in real world lab experiments.

Two subatomic particles entangled in a superposition state, where if one spins one way
then the other must spin the other way, will do just that, even when there's no way for
information to pass from one particle to the other indicating which way to spin to obey
the rules of entanglement. It's not surprising then that entanglement is at the core of
quantum information science, a growing field studying how to use the laws of the strange
quantum world in our macroscopic world, like in quantum cryptography, so spies can send
secure messages to each other, or quantum computing, for cracking secret codes. Everyday
physics may start to look a bit more like the strange quantum world. Quantum teleportation
 may even progress so far, that one day your cat will escape to a safer galaxy, where
there are no physicists and no boxes.
