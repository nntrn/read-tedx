title: How I learned to communicate my inner life with Asperger's
speaker: Alix Generous
description: >-
 Alix Generous is a young woman with a million and one ideas -- she's done
 award-winning science, helped develop new technology and tells a darn good joke
 (you'll see). She has Asperger's, a form of autistic spectrum disorder that can
 impair the basic social skills required for communication, and she's worked hard
 for years to learn how to share her thoughts with the world. In this funny,
 personal talk, she shares her story -- and her vision for tools to help more
 people communicate their big ideas.

Today, I want to talk to you about dreams. I have been a lucid dreamer my whole life, and
it's cooler than in the movies. 

Beyond flying, breathing fire, and making hot men spontaneously appear ...

I can do things like read and write music. Fun fact is that I wrote my personal statement
to college in a dream. And I did accepted. So, yeah. I am a very visual thinker. I think in
pictures, not words. To me, words are more like instincts and language. There are many
people like me; Nikola Tesla, for example, who could visualize, design, test, and
troubleshoot everything — all of his inventions — in his mind, accurately. Language is kind
of exclusive to our species, anyway. I am a bit more primitive, like a beta version of
Google Translate. 

My brain has the ability to hyper-focus on things that interest me. For example, once I
had an affair with calculus that lasted longer than some celebrity marriages.

There are some other unusual things about me. You may have noticed that I don't have much
inflection in my voice. That's why people often confuse me with a GPS.

This can make basic communication a challenge, unless you need directions.

Thank you. 

A few years ago, when I started doing presentations, I went to get head shots done for the
first time. The photographer told me to look flirty. 

And I had no idea what she was talking about. 

She said, "Do that thing, you know, with your eyes, when you're flirting with guys.""What
thing?" I asked."You know, squint."And so I tried, really. It looked something like this.

I looked like I was searching for Waldo. 

There's a reason for this, as there is a reason that Waldo is hiding. 

I have Asperger's, a high-functioning form of autism that impairs the basic social skills
one is expected to display. It's made life difficult in many ways, and growing up, I
struggled to fit in socially. My friends would tell jokes, but I didn't understand them.
My personal heroes were George Carlin and Stephen Colbert — and they taught me humor. My
personality switched from being shy and awkward to being defiant and cursing out a storm.
Needless to say, I did not have many friends. I was also hypersensitive to texture. The
feel of water on my skin was like pins and needles, and so for years, I refused to shower.
I can assure you that my hygiene routine is up to standards now, though.

I had to do a lot to get here, and my parents — things kind of got out of control when I
was sexually assaulted by a peer, and on top of everything, it made a difficult situation
worse. And I had to travel 2,000 miles across the country to get treatment, but within
days of them prescribing a new medication, my life turned into an episode of the Walking
Dead. I became paranoid, and began to hallucinate that rotting corpses were coming towards
me. My family finally rescued me, but by that time, I had lost 19 pounds in those three
weeks, as well as developing severe anemia, and was on the verge of suicide. I transferred
to a new treatment center that understood my aversions, my trauma, and my social anxiety,
and they knew how to treat it, and I got the help I finally needed. And after 18 months of
hard work, I went on to do incredible things. One of the things with Asperger's is that
oftentimes, these people have a very complex inner life, and I know for myself, I have a
very colorful personality, rich ideas, and just a lot going on in my mind.

But there's a gap between where that stands, and how I communicate it with the rest of the
world. And this can make basic communication a challenge. Not many places would hire me,
due to my lack of social skills, which is why I applied to Waffle House.

Waffle House is an exceptional 24-hour diner — 

thank you — where you can order your hash browns the many ways that someone would dispose
of a human corpse ... 

Sliced, diced, peppered, chunked, topped, capped, and covered. 

As social norms would have it, you should only go to Waffle House at an ungodly hour in
the night. 

So one time, at 2 am, I was chatting with a waitress, and I asked her, "What's the most
ridiculous thing that's happened to you on the job?" And she told me that one time, a man
walked in completely naked. 

I said, "Great! Sign me up for the graveyard shift!" 

Needless to say, Waffle House did not hire me. So in terms of having Asperger's, it can be
viewed as a disadvantage, and sometimes it is a real pain in the butt, but it's also the
opposite. It's a gift, and it allows me to think innovatively. At 19, I won a research
competition for my research on coral reefs, and I ended up speaking at the UN Convention
of Biological Diversity, presenting this research. 

Thank you. 

And at 22, I'm getting ready to graduate college, and I am a co-founder of a biotech
company called AutismSees. 

Thank you. 

But consider what I had to do to get here: 25 therapists, 11 misdiagnoses, and years of
pain and trauma. I spent a lot of time thinking if there's a better way, and I think there
is: autism-assistive technology. This technology could play an integral role in helping
people with autistic spectrum disorder, or ASD.The app Podium, released by my company,
AutismSees, has the ability to independently assess and help develop communication skills.
In addition to this, it tracks eye contact through camera and simulates a public-speaking
and job-interview experience. And so maybe one day, Waffle House will hire me, after
practicing on it some more. 

And one of the great things is that I've used Podium to help me prepare for today, and
it's been a great help. But it's more than that. There's more that can be done. For people
with ASD — it has been speculated that many innovative scientists, researchers, artists,
and engineers have it; like, for example, Emily Dickinson, Jane Austen, Isaac Newton, and
Bill Gates are some examples. But the problem that's encountered is that these brilliant
ideas often can't be shared if there are communication roadblocks. And so, many people
with autism are being overlooked every day, and they're being taken advantage of. So my
dream for people with autism is to change that, to remove the roadblocks that prevent them
from succeeding. One of the reasons I love lucid dreaming is because it allows me to be
free, without judgment of social and physical consequences. When I'm flying over scenes
that I create in my mind, I am at peace. I am free from judgment, and so I can do whatever
I want, you know?

I'm making out with Brad Pitt, and Angelina is totally cool with it. 

But the goal of autism-assistive technology is bigger than that, and more important. My
goal is to shift people's perspective of autism and people with higher-functioning
Asperger's because there is a lot they can do. I mean, look at Temple Grandin, for
example. And by doing so, we allow people to share their talents with this world and move
this world forward. In addition, we give them the courage to pursue their dreams in the
real world, in real time. Thank you.

Thank you.
