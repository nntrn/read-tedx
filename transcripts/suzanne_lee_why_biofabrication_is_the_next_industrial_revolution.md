title: Why "biofabrication" is the next industrial revolution
speaker: Suzanne Lee
description: >-
 What if we could "grow" clothes from microbes, furniture from living organisms
 and buildings with exteriors like tree bark? TED Fellow Suzanne Lee shares
 exciting developments from the field of biofabrication and shows how it could
 help us replace major sources of waste, like plastic and cement, with sustainable
 and eco-friendly alternatives.

I started life as a fashion designer, working closely with textile designers and fabric
suppliers. But today, I can no longer see or talk to my new collaborators, because they're
in the soil beneath our feet, on the shelves of our supermarkets and in the beer I'm going
to drink when I finish this talk. I'm talking about microbes and designing with
life. Fifteen years ago, I completely changed both what I worked with and how I worked
after a revelatory collaboration with a biologist. Our project gave me a different
perspective on life, introducing a whole new world of possibility around how we can design
and make things. I discovered a radical manufacturing proposition: biofabrication.
Literally, fabricating with biology. What does that mean? Well, instead of processing
plants, animals or oil to make consumer materials, we might grow materials directly with
living organisms. In what many are terming "the Fourth Industrial Revolution," we're
thinking about the new factories as being living cells.

Bacteria, algae, fungi, yeast: our latest design tools include those of biotechnology. My
own journey in biofabrication started with a project called "Biocouture." The provocation
was that instead of growing a plant, like cotton, in a field over several months, we could
use microbes to grow a similar cellulose material in a lab in a few days. Using a certain
species of bacteria in a nutrient-rich liquid, we fermented threads of cellulose that
self-organized into a sheet of fabric. I dried the fabric I had grown and cut and sewed it
into a range of garments, shoes and bags. In other words, in one lab we grew materials and
turned them into a range of products in a matter of days. And this is in contrast to
currents methods of fabric production, where a plant is grown, just the cotton part is
harvested, processed into a yarn, woven into a fabric and then potentially shipped across
oceans before being cut and sewn into a garment.

All of that can take months. So these prototypes indicated a field offering significant
resource efficiencies. From reducing the water, energy and chemistry needed in the
production of a material, through to generating zero waste, we grew fabrics to finished
form — if you like, "biological additive manufacture."Through biofabrication, I had
replaced many intensive man-made steps with one biological step. And as I engaged with
this living system, it transformed my design thinking. Here was biology, with no
intervention from me other than designing initial conditions for growth, efficiently
producing a useful, sustainable material. So now I can't help but see all materials through
the lens of biofabrication. In fact, there's a growing global community of innovators
rethinking materials with biology. Multiple companies are now growing mushroom materials,
but not literally mushrooms — using mycelium, which is the root system of fungi, to bind
together agricultural byproducts.

It's a process that's been described as "nature's glue." A common way to do this is to
take a 3-D mold, fill it with a waste crop like corn stalks or hemp, add water, wait a few
days for the mycelium to grow throughout, remove the mold, and you're left with a grown
3-D form. Incredibly, we can grow all kinds of structures using living organisms, from
foams that can replace plastics in footwear, to leather-like materials without animals.
Furniture, flooring — all are currently being prototyped. Fungi are able to grow materials
that are naturally fire retardant, without any chemicals. They're naturally hydrophobic,
meaning they won't absorb water. They have higher melt temperatures than plastics.
Polystyrene can take thousands of years to degrade. Mushroom packaging materials can be
naturally composted in your back garden in as little as 30 days. Living organisms are
transforming waste into cost-competitive, performance-matching materials that can start to
replace plastics and other CO2-emitting materials. And once we start growing materials with
living organisms, it starts to make previous methods of manufacture seem
illogical.

Take the humble house brick. The cement industry generates around eight percent of global
CO2 emissions. That's more than all the planes and ships each year. The cement process
requires materials to be fired in a kiln at over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Compare this to
bioMASON. They use a soil microbe to transform loose aggregates, like sand or crushed
stone, into a biofabricated, or biocement, brick. Their process happens at room
temperature, in just a couple of days. Think: hydroponics for bricks. An irrigation system
feeds nutrient-rich water to trays of bricks that have been inoculated with bacteria. The
bacteria produce crystals that form around each grain of sand, locking together all the
loose particles to form a solid brick. We can now grow construction materials in the
elegant way nature does, just like a coral reef. And these biofabricated bricks are nearly
three times stronger than a concrete block.

And in stark contrast to traditional cement production, they store more carbon than they
make. So if we could replace the 1.2 trillion fired bricks that are made each year with
biofabricated bricks, we could reduce CO2 emissions by 800 million tons every
year.

Beyond growing materials with living organisms, we're even starting to design products
that encourage their growth. And this comes from the realization that the very thing we've
been trying to marginalize — life — might actually be our greatest collaborator. To that
end, we've been exploring all the ways that we can grow healthy microbes in our own
ecosystems. A great example of this is architects who are imagining the skin of a building
to function like the bark of a tree. But not as a cosmetic green layer. They're designing
architectural barks as hosts for evolving ecologies. These surface structures are designed
to invite life in. And if we applied the same energy we currently do suppressing forms of
life towards cultivating life, we'd turn the negative image of the urban jungle into one
that literally embodies a thriving, living ecosystem. By actively encouraging surface
interactions with healthy microbes, we could improve passive climate control, stormwater
management and even reduce CO2 emissions by lowering the energy used to heat or cool our
buildings. We're just beginning to realize the potential of nature-based
technologies.

I'm excited that we're starting to design and biofabricate a new material world. It's one
that moves away from the exploitation of nonrenewable resources to working with the
original, renewable life. Instead of designing out life, we're designing with it and for
it. Packaging, fashion, footwear, furniture, construction — biofabricated products can be
grown close to centers of demand, with local resources, less land, energy, and even
harnessing industrial waste streams. It used to be that the tools of biotechnology were the
preserve of powerful, multinational chemical and biotech companies. In the last century,
we expected material innovation to come from the likes of DuPont, Dow, BASF. But this
21st-century material revolution is being led by start-ups with small teams and limited
capital. And by the way, not all their founders have science degrees. They include
artists, architects and designers.

Over a billion dollars has already been invested in start-ups biofabricating consumer
products. I don't think we have a choice but to biofabricate our future. From the jacket
you're wearing to the chair you're sitting in to the home you live in, your designed
material world shouldn't compromise your health or that of our planet. If materials can't
be recycled or naturally composted at home, we should reject them. I'm committed to making
this future a reality by shining a light on all the amazing work being done today and by
facilitating more interactions between designers, scientists, investors and brands.
Because we need a material revolution, and we need it now. Thank you.
