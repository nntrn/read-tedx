description: >-
 In 1928, scientist Alexander Fleming returned to his lab and found something
 unexpected: a colony of mold growing on a Petri dish he'd forgotten to place in
 his incubator. And around this colony of mold was a zone completely and
 surprisingly clear of bacteria. What was this mysterious phenomenon? Allison
 Ramsey and Mary Staicu detail the discovery of penicillin and how it transformed
 medicine. [Directed by WOW-HOW Studio, narrated by Susan Zimmerman].

London, 1928: a group of mold spores surf a breeze through a lab. They drift onto a petri
dish, and when they land, they germinate a medical revolution. This lab belongs to
Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist investigating the properties of infectious
bacteria. At this time, Fleming is away on vacation. When he returns, he finds a colony
of mold growing on a petri dish he’d forgotten to place in his incubator. And around this
colony of mold is a zone completely and unexpectedly clear of bacteria. In studying this
mysterious phenomenon, Fleming came to realize that the mold was secreting some kind of
compound that was killing the bacteria. The mold was a species in the Penicillium genus,
so Fleming dubbed the antibacterial compound “penicillin.”What Fleming stumbled upon was
a microbial defense system. The penicillium mold constantly produces penicillin in order
to defend itself from threats, such as nearby bacterial colonies that might consume its
resources.

Penicillin destroys many types of bacteria by disrupting synthesis of their cell walls.
These walls get their strength from a thick, protective mesh of sugars and amino acids,
that are constantly being broken down and rebuilt. Penicillin binds to one of the
compounds that weaves this mesh together and prevents the wall from being reconstructed
at a critical phase. Meanwhile, penicillin stimulates the release of highly reactive
molecules that cause additional damage. Eventually, the cell’s structure breaks down
completely. This two-pronged attack is lethal to a wide range of bacteria, whether in
petri-dishes, our bodies, or elsewhere. It’s not, however, harmful to our own cells,
because those don’t have cell walls. For a decade or so after Fleming’s discovery,
penicillin remained a laboratory curiosity. But during World War II, researchers figured
out how to isolate the active compound and grow the mold in larger quantities.

They then went on to win the Nobel Prize for their work. Teams at Oxford and several
American drug companies continued development, and within a few years it was
commercially available. Penicillin and similar compounds quickly transformed the
treatment of infections. For the time being, they remain some of the most important, 
life-saving antibiotics used in medicine. However, the more we use any antibiotic, the
more bacteria evolve resistance to it. In the case of penicillin, some bacteria produce
compounds that can break down the key structure that interferes with cell wall synthesis.
As antibiotic use has increased, more and more bacteria have evolved this defense, making
these antibiotics ineffective against a growing number of bacterial infections. This
means it’s essential that doctors not overprescribe the drug. Meanwhile, 5 to 15% of
patients in developed countries self-identify as allergic to penicillin, making it the
most commonly reported drug allergy.

However, the vast majority— over 90%— of people who think they’re allergic to penicillin
actually are not. Why the misperception? Many patients acquire the allergy label as
children, when a rash appears after they’re treated for an infection with penicillin or
closely related drugs. The rash is often blamed on penicillin, while the more likely
culprit is the original infection, or a reaction between the infection and the
antibiotic. However, genuine penicillin allergies, where our immune systems mistake
penicillin for an attacker, do occur rarely and can be very dangerous. So if you think
you’re allergic but don’t know for sure, your best bet is to visit an allergist. They’ll
complete an evaluation that’ll confirm whether or not you have the allergy. Even if you do
have a penicillin allergy, your immune cells that react to the drug may lose their
ability to recognize it. In fact, about 80% of people who are allergic to penicillin
outgrow their allergy within ten years.

This is great news for people who currently identify as allergic to penicillin; the drug
may one day save their lives, as it has done for so many others.
