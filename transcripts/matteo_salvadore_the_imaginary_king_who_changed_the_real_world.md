In 1165, copies of a strange letter began to circulate throughout Western Europe. It
spoke of a fantastical realm, containing the Tower of Babel and the Fountain of Youth—
all ruled over by the letter’s mysterious author: Prester John. Today, we know that this
extraordinary king never existed. But the legend of this mythical kingdom and its
powerful ruler would impact the decisions of European leaders for the next 400 years.
Prester John’s myth would propel the age of exploration, inspire intercontinental
diplomacy, and indirectly begin a civil war. When Prester John’s letter appeared, Europe
was embroiled in the Crusades. In this series of religious wars, Europeans campaigned to
seize what they regarded as the Christian Holy Land. The Church vilified any faith 
outside of Christianity, including that of the Jewish and Muslim communities populating
the region. Crusaders were eager to find Christian kingdoms to serve as allies in their
war.

And they were particularly interested in rumors of a powerful Christian king who had
defeated an enormous Muslim army in the Far East. In fact, it was a Mongol horde including
converted Christian tribes that had routed the army. But news of this victory traveled
unreliably. Merchants and emissaries filled gaps in the story with epic poems and
Biblical fragments. By the time the story reached Europe, the Mongol horde had been
replaced with a great Christian army, commanded by a king who shared the Crusader’s
vision of marching on Jerusalem. And when a letter allegedly written by this so-called
“Prester John” appeared, European rulers were thrilled. While the letter’s actual author 
remains unknown, its stereotypes about the East and alignment with European goals
indicate it was a Western forgery. But despite the letter’s obvious origins as European
propaganda, the appeal of Prester John’s myth was too great for the Crusaders to
ignore.

Before long, European mapmakers were guessing the location of his mythical kingdom. In the
13th and 14th centuries, European missionaries went East, along the newly revived Silk
Road. They weren’t searching for the letter’s author, who would have been over a century
old; but rather, for his descendants. The title of Prester John was briefly identified
with several Central Asian rulers, but it soon became clear that the Mongols were largely
non-Christian. And as their Empire began to decline, Europeans began pursuing alternate
routes to the Far East, and new clues to Prester John’s location. At the same time these
explorers went south, Ethiopian pilgrims began traveling north. In Rome, these visitors 
quickly attracted the interest of European scholars and cartographers. Since Ethiopia had
been converted to Christianity in the 4th century, the stories of their African homeland 
fit perfectly into Prester John’s legend.

Portuguese explorers scoured Africa for the kingdom, until a mix of confusion and
diplomacy finally turned myth into reality. The Ethiopians graciously received their
European guests, who were eager to do business with the ruler they believed to be Prester
John. Though the Ethiopians were initially confused by the Portuguese’s unusual name for
their Emperor, they were savvy enough to recognize the diplomatic capital it afforded
them. The Ethiopian diplomats played the part of Prester John’s subjects, and the
Portuguese triumphantly announced an alliance with the fabled sovereign— over 350 years
after the European letter had begun the search. But this long-awaited partnership was
quickly tested. A decade later, the Sultanate of Adal, a regional power supported by the
Ottoman Empire, invaded Ethiopia. The Portuguese sent troops that helped Ethiopians win
this conflict. But by this time, it was clear that Ethiopia was not the powerful ally
Europe had hoped.

Worse still, the increasingly intolerant Roman Catholic Church now deemed the Ethiopian
sect of Christianity heretical. Their subsequent attempts to convert the people they
once revered as ideal Christians would eventually spark a civil war, and in the 1630s, 
Ethiopia cut ties with Europe. Over the next two centuries, the legend of Prester John 
slowly faded into oblivion— ending the reign of a king who made history despite having
never existed.
