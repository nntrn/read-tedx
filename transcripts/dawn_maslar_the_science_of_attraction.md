title: The science of attraction
speaker: Dawn Maslar
description: >-
 Romantic chemistry is all about warm, gooey feelings that gush from the deepest
 depths of the heart...right? Not quite. Actually, the real boss behind attraction
 is your brain, which runs through a very quick, very complex series of calculations
 when assessing a potential partner. Dawn Maslar explores how our five senses
 contribute to this mating game, citing some pretty wild studies along the way.
 [Directed by TOGETHER, narrated by Addison Anderson].

We like to think of romantic feelings as spontaneous and indescribable things that come
from the heart. But it's actually your brain running a complex series of calculations
within a matter of seconds that's responsible for determining attraction. Doesn't sound
quite as poetic, does it? But just because the calculations are happening in your brain
doesn't mean those warm, fuzzy feelings are all in your head. In fact, all five of your
senses play a role, each able to vote for, or veto, a budding attraction. The eyes are the
first components in attraction. Many visual beauty standards vary between cultures and
eras, and signs of youth, fertility and good health, such as long lustrous hair, or
smooth, scar-free skin, are almost always in demand because they're associated with
reproductive fitness. And when the eyes spot something they like, our instinct is to move
closer so the other senses can investigate. The nose's contribution to romance is more
than noticing perfume or cologne.

It's able to pick up on natural chemical signals known as pheromones. These not only
convey important physical or genetic information about their source but are able to
activate a physiological or behavioral response in the recipient. In one study, a group of
women at different points in their ovulation cycles wore the same T-shirts for three
nights. After male volunteers were randomly assigned to smell either one of the worn
shirts, or a new unworn one, saliva samples showed an increase in testosterone in those
who had smelled a shirt worn by an ovulating woman. Such a testosterone boost may give a
man the nudge to pursue a woman he might not have otherwise noticed. A woman's nose is
particularly attuned to MHC molecules, which are used to fight disease. In this case,
opposites attract. When a study asked women to smell T-shirts that had been worn by
different men, they preferred the odors of those whose MHC molecules differed from theirs.
This makes sense.

Genes that result in a greater variety of immunities may give offspring a major survival
advantage. Our ears also determine attraction. Men prefer females with high-pitched,
breathy voices, and wide formant spacing, correlated with smaller body size. While women
prefer low-pitched voices with a narrow formant spacing that suggest a larger body size.
And not surprisingly, touch turns out to be crucial for romance. In this experiment, not
realizing the study had begun, participants were asked to briefly hold the coffee, either
hot or iced. Later, the participants read a story about a hypothetical person, and were
asked to rate their personality. Those who had held the hot cup of coffee perceived the
person in the story as happier, more social, more generous and better-natured than those
who had held the cup of iced coffee, who rated the person as cold, stoic, and
unaffectionate. If a potential mate has managed to pass all these tests, there's still one
more: the infamous first kiss, a rich and complex exchange of tactile and chemical cues,
such as the smell of one's breath, and the taste of their mouth.

This magical moment is so critical that a majority of men and women have reported losing
their attraction to someone after a bad first kiss. Once attraction is confirmed, your
bloodstream is flooded with norepinephrine, activating your fight or flight system. Your
heart beats faster, your pupils dilate, and your body releases glucose for additional
energy, not because you're in danger but because your body is telling you that something
important is happening. To help you focus, norepinephrine creates a sort of tunnel vision,
blocking out surrounding distractions, possibly even warping your sense of time, and
enhancing your memory. This might explain why people never forget their first kiss. The
idea of so much of our attraction being influenced by chemicals and evolutionary biology
may seem cold and scientific rather than romantic, but the next time you see someone you
like, try to appreciate how your entire body is playing matchmaker to decide if that
beautiful stranger is right for you.
