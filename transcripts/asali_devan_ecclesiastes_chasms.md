There are some chasms so deep and so wide, we find it hard to imagine how we'll ever make
it to the other side. That space between who we are and who we want to be, the gaps
between our high ideals and our base realities. The distance between what we say and what
we really mean. The raging river that flows between what actually happened and our
convenient memories. The lies we tell ourselves are lakes, overflowing their banks,
flooding our speech with waters, caustic and rank. The only bridge is the truth, passing
through me and you, as we look one another eye to eye. But so often, that look is filled
with our hesitations, and we can't help but glance to the side. See, we've long ago let go
of the language with which we describe our softer parts. We learn early that those with
softer hearts suffer. So we allow lean emotion to reign, never noticing that only strain
has been the fruit of our restraints. We haven't escaped pain. And our battle scars are
far from faint.

Yet and still, despite our desire and willingness to heal, we often find ourselves
fighting hard in the paint, holding onto false images of everything we ain't. So while our
dream coincide, our fears collide. And we want to know one another, but think we can't. The
gulf between empathy and equity is as unfathomable as the fissures that line our
collective integrity. And we spend eternal eternities trying to translate that into
virtue. Perhaps you have met one or two of the virtuous on your path. They are only very
few, and I know that I have, from time to time, mistaken pretenders for real, yet still
make room for the possibility that it's I who's been pretending. Please, bear with me, I'm
still mending, but I'm no longer bending to the will of my injuries, nor my injurers. I
much prefer to stretch my arms like Nüt until I become the sky. I'd rather stretch my
tongue with truth, our bridge to cross when we look one another in the eye. But the tongue,
like the heart, gets tired.

The weak make it hard for the strong to stay inspired, like the lost prevent the found
from escaping the mire, and the degraded stop the enlightened from taking us higher. But no
matter what you hear from the mouths of these liars, we are one people with one destiny
and the common enemy, that's why it really stresses me to see our hearts so tattered, our
minds so scattered, our egos so easily flattered. We're enslaved, yet think of our
shackles as gifts. Rather than resist our masters, we let them widen our rifts, like
mindless, material junkies, we seek that which lowers, not lifts. But somewhere in our
midst, there's been a paradigm shift. Justice is getting restless in its chains. Our youth
find it useless to separate their souls from their brains, their truth is ingrained, their
integrity insustained. Let me call your attention to those who serve as examples. Those who
daily give their all, but their reserves are still ample.

Those who battle friend and foe, yet their hope is never trampled, they make music, never
sample, and the world's ugly could never cancel the fullness and the sweetness of their
composition. Nor the unadulterated truth of their mission. It's time we shut our mouths and
listen. Close our eyes and pray for the humility and the guidance to follow them to the
way. Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you all so much, you have no idea how fulfilling and energizing that is. For the
past three years, I've had the privilege of codesigning with my neighbors a space in New
Orleans known as Under the Bridge. In 1966, Interstate 10 landed on the Tremé
neighborhood, displacing 326 black-owned businesses, over 300 live oak trees, effectively
destroying the region's most successful black commercial district, disrupting
intergenerational wealth and truly unraveling the fabric of the nation's oldest African
American neighborhood. Today, after 45 years of community advocacy, after 500 hours of
community engagement and 80 hours of community design, we are so excited that in 2018,
after capturing the voices of thousands of residents and the support of our local, federal
and philanthropic partners, as the city celebrates 300 years of transforming the world, we
will get to transform 19 blocks under the Interstate into community space, into
black-owned businesses, in the form of the Claiborne Corridor Cultural Innovation
District.

We will be bridging time, we will bridge memory, we will bridge disparity and injustice,
and we can't wait to see you all on the other side. Thank you.
