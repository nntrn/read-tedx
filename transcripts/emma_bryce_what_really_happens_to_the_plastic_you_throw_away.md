title: What really happens to the plastic you throw away?
speaker: Emma Bryce
description: >-
 We've all been told that we should recycle plastic bottles and containers. But
 what actually happens to the plastic if we just throw it away? Emma Bryce traces
 the life cycles of three different plastic bottles, shedding light on the dangers
 these disposables present to our world. [Directed by Sharon Colman, narrated by
 Addison Anderson, music by Peter Gosling].

This is the story of three plastic bottles, empty and discarded. Their journeys are about
to diverge with outcomes that impact nothing less than the fate of the planet. But they
weren't always this way. To understand where these bottles end up, we must first explore
their origins. The heroes of our story were conceived in this oil refinery. The plastic in
their bodies was formed by chemically bonding oil and gas molecules together to make
monomers. In turn, these monomers were bonded into long polymer chains to make plastic in
the form of millions of pellets. Those were melted at manufacturing plants and reformed in
molds to create the resilient material that makes up the triplets' bodies. Machines filled
the bottles with sweet bubbily liquid and they were then wrapped, shipped, bought, opened,
consumed and unceremoniously discarded. And now here they lie, poised at the edge of the
unknown. Bottle one, like hundreds of millions of tons of his plastic brethren, ends up in
a landfill.

This huge dump expands each day as more trash comes in and continues to take up space. As
plastics sit there being compressed amongst layers of other junk, rainwater flows through
the waste and absorbs the water-soluble compounds it contains, and some of those are
highly toxic. Together, they create a harmful stew called leachate, which can move into
groundwater, soil and streams, poisoning ecosystems and harming wildlife. It can take
bottle one an agonizing 1,000 years to decompose. Bottle two's journey is stranger but,
unfortunately, no happier. He floats on a trickle that reaches a stream, a stream that
flows into a river, and a river that reaches the ocean. After months lost at sea, he's
slowly drawn into a massive vortex, where trash accumulates, a place known as the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch. Here the ocean's currents have trapped millions of pieces of
plastic debris. This is one of five plastic-filled gyres in the world's
seas.

Places where the pollutants turn the water into a cloudy plastic soup. Some animals, like
seabirds, get entangled in the mess. They, and others, mistake the brightly colored
plastic bits for food. Plastic makes them feel full when they're not, so they starve to
death and pass the toxins from the plastic up the food chain. For example, it's eaten by
lanternfish, the lanternfish are eaten by squid, the squid are eaten by tuna, and the tuna
are eaten by us. And most plastics don't biodegrade, which means they're destined to break
down into smaller and smaller pieces called micro plastics, which might rotate in the sea
eternally. But bottle three is spared the cruel purgatories of his brothers. A truck brings
him to a plant where he and his companions are squeezed flat and compressed into a block.
Okay, this sounds pretty bad, too, but hang in there. It gets better. The blocks are
shredded into tiny pieces, which are washed and melted, so they become the raw materials
that can be used again.

As if by magic, bottle three is now ready to be reborn as something completely new. For
this bit of plastic with such humble origins, suddenly the sky is the limit.
