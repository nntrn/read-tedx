You’re on an airplane when you feel a sudden jolt. Outside your window nothing seems to
be happening, yet the plane continues to rattle you and your fellow passengers as it
passes through turbulent air in the atmosphere. Although it may not comfort you to hear
it, this phenomenon is one of the prevailing mysteries of physics. After more than a
century of studying turbulence, we’ve only come up with a few answers for how it works
and affects the world around us. And yet, turbulence is ubiquitous, springing up in
virtually any system that has moving fluids. That includes the airflow in your
respiratory tract. The blood moving through your arteries. And the coffee in your cup, as
you stir it. Clouds are governed by turbulence, as are waves crashing along the shore and
the gusts of plasma in our sun. Understanding precisely how this phenomenon works would
have a bearing on so many aspects of our lives. Here’s what we do know.

Liquids and gases usually have two types of motion: a laminar flow, which is stable and
smooth; and a turbulent flow, which is composed of seemingly unorganized swirls. Imagine
an incense stick. The laminar flow of unruffled smoke at the base is steady and easy to
predict. Closer to the top, however, the smoke accelerates, becomes unstable, and the
pattern of movement changes to something chaotic. That’s turbulence in action, and
turbulent flows have certain characteristics in common. Firstly, turbulence is always
chaotic. That’s different from being random. Rather, this means that turbulence is very
sensitive to disruptions. A little nudge one way or the other will eventually turn into 
completely different results. That makes it nearly impossible to predict what will
happen, even with a lot of information about the current state of a system. Another
important characteristic of turbulence is the different scales of motion that these
flows display.

Turbulent flows have many differently-sized whirls called eddies, which are like vortices
of different sizes and shapes. All those differently-sized eddies interact with each
other, breaking up to become smaller and smaller until all that movement is transformed
into heat, in a process called the “energy cascade."So that’s how we recognize turbulence–
but why does it happen? In every flowing liquid or gas there are two opposing forces:
inertia and viscosity. Inertia is the tendency of fluids to keep moving, which causes
instability. Viscosity works against disruption, making the flow laminar instead. In thick
fluids such as honey, viscosity almost always wins. Less viscous substances like water or
air are more prone to inertia, which creates instabilities that develop into
turbulence. We measure where a flow falls on that spectrum with something called the
Reynolds number, which is the ratio between a flow’s inertia and its viscosity.

The higher the Reynolds number, the more likely it is that turbulence will occur. Honey
being poured into a cup, for example, has a Reynolds number of about 1. The same set up
with water has a Reynolds number that’s closer to 10,000.The Reynolds number is useful
for understanding simple scenarios, but it’s ineffective in many situations. For example,
the motion of the atmosphere is significantly influenced by factors including gravity and
the earth’s rotation. Or take relatively simple things like the drag on buildings and
cars. We can model those thanks to many experiments and empirical evidence. But
physicists want to be able to predict them through physical laws and equations as well as
we can model the orbits of planets or electromagnetic fields. Most scientists think that
getting there will rely on statistics and increased computing power. Extremely high-speed
computer simulations of turbulent flows could help us identify patterns that could lead
to a theory that organizes and unifies predictions across different situations.

Other scientists think that the phenomenon is so complex that such a full-fledged theory 
isn’t ever going to be possible. Hopefully we’ll reach a breakthrough, because a true
understanding of turbulence could have huge positive impacts. That would include more 
efficient wind farms; the ability to better prepare for catastrophic weather events; or
even the power to manipulate hurricanes away. And, of course, smoother rides for
millions of airline passengers.
