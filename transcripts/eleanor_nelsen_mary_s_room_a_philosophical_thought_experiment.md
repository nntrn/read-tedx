title: Mary's Room: A philosophical thought experiment
speaker: Eleanor Nelsen
description: >-
 Imagine a neuroscientist who has only ever seen black and white things, but she
 is an expert in color vision and knows everything about its physics and biology.
 If, one day, she sees color, does she learn anything new? Is there anything about
 perceiving color that wasn't captured in her knowledge? Eleanor Nelsen explains
 what this thought experiment can teach us about experience. [Directed by Maxime
 Dupuy, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Martin Pinon].

Imagine a brilliant neuroscientist named Mary. Mary lives in a black and white room, she
only reads black and white books, and her screens only display black and white. But even
though she has never seen color, Mary is an expert in color vision and knows everything
ever discovered about its physics and biology. She knows how different wavelengths of
light stimulate three types of cone cells in the retina, and she knows how electrical
signals travel down the optic nerve into the brain. There, they create patterns of
neural activity that correspond to the millions of colors most humans can distinguish. Now
imagine that one day, Mary's black and white screen malfunctions and an apple appears in
color. For the first time, she can experience something that she's known about for years.
Does she learn anything new? Is there anything about perceiving color that wasn't captured
in all her knowledge? Philosopher Frank Jackson proposed this thought experiment, called
Mary's room, in 1982.

He argued that if Mary already knew all the physical facts about color vision, and
experiencing color still teaches her something new, then mental states, like color
perception, can't be completely described by physical facts. The Mary's room thought
experiment describes what philosophers call the knowledge argument, that there are
non-physical properties and knowledge which can only be discovered through conscious
experience. The knowledge argument contradicts the theory of physicalism, which says that
everything, including mental states, has a physical explanation. To most people hearing
Mary's story, it seems intuitively obvious that actually seeing color will be totally
different than learning about it. Therefore, there must be some quality of color vision
that transcends its physical description. The knowledge argument isn't just about color
vision. Mary's room uses color vision to represent conscious experience.

If physical science can't entirely explain color vision, then maybe it can't entirely
explain other conscious experiences either. For instance, we could know every physical
detail about the structure and function of someone else's brain, but still not understand
what it feels like to be that person. These ineffable experiences have properties called
qualia, subjective qualities that you can't accurately describe or measure. Qualia are
unique to the person experiencing them, like having an itch, being in love, or feeling
bored. Physical facts can't completely explain mental states like this. Philosophers
interested in artificial intelligence have used the knowledge argument to theorize that
recreating a physical state won't necessarily recreate a corresponding mental state. In
other words, building a computer which mimicked the function of every single neuron of
the human brain won't necessarily create a conscious computerized brain.

Not all philosophers agree that the Mary's room experiment is useful. Some argue that her
extensive knowledge of color vision would have allowed her to create the same mental state
produced by actually seeing the color. The screen malfunction wouldn't show her anything
new. Others say that her knowledge was never complete in the first place because it was
based only on those physical facts that can be conveyed in words. Years after he proposed
it, Jackson actually reversed his own stance on his thought experiment. He decided that
even Mary's experience of seeing red still does correspond to a measurable physical event
in the brain, not unknowable qualia beyond physical explanation. But there still isn't a
definitive answer to the question of whether Mary would learn anything new when she sees
the apple. Could it be that there are fundamental limits to what we can know about
something we can't experience?

And would this mean there are certain aspects of the universe that lie permanently beyond
our comprehension? Or will science and philosophy allow us to overcome our mind's
limitations?
