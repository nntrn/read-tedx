So, a funny thing happened on my way to becoming a brilliant, world-class
neuropsychologist: I had a baby. And that's not to say I ever went on to become a
brilliant, world-class neuropsychologist. Sorry, TED. But I did go on to be a reasonably
astute, arguably world-class worrier. One of my girlfriends in graduate school, Marie,
said, "Kim, I figured it out. It's not that you're more neurotic than everyone else; it's
just that you're more honest about how neurotic you are."So in the spirit of full
disclosure, I brought some pictures to share. Awwww.

I'll just say: July.

Zip!

For safety.

Water wings — an inch of water. And then, finally, all suited up for the 90-minute drive
to Copper Mountain. So you can get kind of a feel for this. So my baby, Vander, is eight
years old now. And, despite being cursed with my athletic inability, he plays soccer. He's
interested in playing football. He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle. So why would I
worry? Because this is what I do. This is what I teach. It's what I study. It's what I
treat. And I know that kids get concussed every year. In fact, more than four million
people sustain a concussion every year, and these data are just among kids under 14 who
were seen in emergency rooms. And so when kids sustain a concussion, we talk about them
getting dinged or getting their bell rung, but what is it that we're really talking about?
Let's take a look.[Concussive Force]"Starsky and Hutch"? Arguably, yes. So, a car
accident. Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier: 35 Gs.

A heavyweight boxer punches you straight in the face: 58 Gs.

In case you missed it, we'll look again. So look to the right-hand side of the
screen.

What would you say? How many Gs? Close. Seventy-two? Would it be crazy to know: 103 Gs?
The average concussive impact is 95 Gs. Now, when the kid on the right doesn't get up, we
know they've had a concussion. But how about the kid on the left, or the athlete that
leaves the field of play? How do we know if he or she has sustained a concussion? How do
we know that legislation that would require they be pulled from play, cleared for return
to play, applies to them? The definition of concussion doesn't actually require a loss of
consciousness. It requires only a change in consciousness, and that can be any one or a
number of symptoms, including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy, hearing a ringing in your ear,
being more impulsive or hostile than usual. So given all of that and given how darn
neurotic I am, how do I get any sleep at all? Because I know our brains are resilient.
They're designed to recover from an injury.

If — God forbid — any of us left here tonight and sustained a concussion, most of us would
go on to fully recover inside of a couple hours to a couple of weeks. But kids are more
vulnerable to brain injury. In fact, high-school athletes are three times more likely to
sustain catastrophic injuries relative even to their college-age peers, and it takes them
longer to return to a symptom-free baseline. After that first injury, their risk for
second injury is exponentially greater. From there, their risk for a third injury, greater
still, and so on. And here's the really alarming part: We don't fully understand the
long-term impact of multiple injuries. You guys may be familiar with this research that's
coming out of the NFL. In a nutshell, this research suggests that, among retired NFL
players with three or more career concussions, the incidence of early-onset dementing
disease is much greater than it is for the general population. So you've all seen that —
New York Times, you've seen it.

What you may not be familiar with is that this research was spearheaded by NFL wives who
said, "Isn't it weird that my 46-year-old husband is forever losing his keys?" "Isn't it
weird that my 47-year-old husband is forever losing the car?" "Isn't it weird that my
48-year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car, from the driveway?" I may
have forgotten to mention that my son is an only child. So it's going to be really
important that he be able to drive me around someday.

So, how do we guarantee the safety of our kids? How can we 100 percent guarantee the
safety of our kids? Let me tell you what I've come up with.

If only. My little boy's right there, and he's like, "She's not kidding. She's totally not
kidding." So in all seriousness: Should my kid play football? Should your kid play
football? I don't know. But I do know there are three things you can do. The first: study
up. You have to be familiar with the issues we're talking about today. There are some
great resources out there. The CDC has a program, HEADS UP. It's at CDC.gov. HEADS UP is
specific to concussion in kids. The second is a resource I'm personally really proud of.
We've just rolled this out in the last couple months — CO Kids With Brain Injury. This is
a great resource for student athletes, teachers, parents, professionals, athletic and
coaching staff. It's a great place to start if you have questions. The second thing is:
speak up. Just two weeks ago, a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas that would have
required athletes, kids under 18, to wear a helmet when they're riding their bike, died in
committee.

It died, in large part, because it lacked constituent buy-in; it lacked stakeholder
traction. Now, I'm not here to tell you what kind of legislation you should or shouldn't
support, but I am going to tell you that, if it matters to you, your legislators need to
know that. Speak up also with coaching staff. Ask about what kind of protective equipment
is available. What's the budget for protective equipment? How old it is? Maybe offer to
spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear. Which brings us to: suit up. Wear a helmet. The
only way to prevent a bad outcome is to prevent that first injury from happening.
Recently, one of my graduate students, Tom, said, "Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmet
on the way to class." And Tom knows that that little bit of foam in a bike helmet can
reduce the g-force of impact by half. Now, I thought it was because I have this totally
compelling helmet crusade, this epiphany of Tom's.

As it turns out, it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet is a good way to protect a $100,000
graduate education.

So ... Should Vander play football? I can't say no, but I can guarantee that every time he
leaves the house, that kid's wearing a helmet — like, to the car, or at school. So whether
athlete, scholar, overprotected kid, neurotic mom, or otherwise, here's my baby, Vander,
reminding you to mind your matter. Thank you.
