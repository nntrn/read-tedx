 Chemist Lee Cronin is working on a 3D printer that, instead of objects, is able
 to print molecules. An exciting potential long-term application: printing your
 own medicine using chemical inks.

Organic chemists make molecules, very complicated molecules, by chopping up a big molecule
into small molecules and reverse engineering. And as a chemist, one of the things I wanted
to ask my research group a couple of years ago is, could we make a really cool universal
chemistry set? In essence, could we "app" chemistry? Now what would this mean, and how
would we do it? Well to start to do this, we took a 3D printer and we started to print our
beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the
other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware. And so by printing the
vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time, we may start to access this universal
toolkit of chemistry. Now what could this mean? Well if we can embed biological and
chemical networks like a search engine, so if you have a cell that's ill that you need to
cure or bacteria that you want to kill, if you have this embedded in your device at the
same time, and you do the chemistry, you may be able to make drugs in a new way. So how are
we doing this in the lab?

Well it requires software, it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks. And so the
really cool bit is, the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put
out with the printer, and you download the blueprint, the organic chemistry for that
molecule and you make it in the device. And so you can make your molecule in the printer
using this software. So what could this mean? Well, ultimately, it could mean that you
could print your own medicine. And this is what we're doing in the lab at the moment. But
to take baby steps to get there, first of all we want to look at drug design and
production, or drug discovery and manufacturing. Because if we can manufacture it after
we've discovered it, we could deploy it anywhere. You don't need to go to the chemist
anymore. We can print drugs at point of need. We can download new diagnostics. Say a new
super bug has emerged. You put it in your search engine, and you create the drug to treat
the threat.

So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly. But perhaps for me the core bit going
into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells, with your genes and your
environment, and you print your own personal medicine. And if that doesn't seem fanciful
enough, where do you think we're going to go? Well, you're going to have your own personal
matter fabricator. Beam me up, Scotty.
