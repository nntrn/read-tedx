You and nine other individuals have been captured by super intelligent alien overlords.
The aliens think humans look quite tasty, but their civilization forbids eating highly
logical and cooperative beings. Unfortunately, they're not sure whether you qualify, so
they decide to give you all a test. Through its universal translator, the alien guarding
you tells you the following: You will be placed in a single-file line facing forward in
size order so that each of you can see everyone lined up ahead of you. You will not be
able to look behind you or step out of line. Each of you will have either a black or a
white hat on your head assigned randomly, and I won't tell you how many of each color
there are. When I say to begin, each of you must guess the color of your hat starting with
the person in the back and moving up the line. And don't even try saying words other than
black or white or signaling some other way, like intonation or volume; you'll all be eaten
immediately.

If at least nine of you guess correctly, you'll all be spared. You have five minutes to
discuss and come up with a plan, and then I'll line you up, assign your hats, and we'll
begin. Can you think of a strategy guaranteed to save everyone? Pause the video now to
figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The key is that the
person at the back of the line who can see everyone else's hats can use the words "black"
or "white" to communicate some coded information. So what meaning can be assigned to
those words that will allow everyone else to deduce their hat colors? It can't be the
total number of black or white hats. There are more than two possible values, but what
does have two possible values is that number's parity, that is whether it's odd or even.
So the solution is to agree that whoever goes first will, for example, say "black" if he
sees an odd number of black hats and "white" if he sees an even number of black
hats.

Let's see how it would play out if the hats were distributed like this. The tallest
captive sees three black hats in front of him, so he says "black," telling everyone else
he sees an odd number of black hats. He gets his own hat color wrong, but that's okay
since you're collectively allowed to have one wrong answer. Prisoner two also sees an odd
number of black hats, so she knows hers is white, and answers correctly. Prisoner three
sees an even number of black hats, so he knows that his must be one of the black hats
the first two prisoners saw. Prisoner four hears that and knows that she should be looking
for an even number of black hats since one was behind her. But she only sees one, so she
deduces that her hat is also black. Prisoners five through nine are each looking for an
odd number of black hats, which they see, so they figure out that their hats are white.
Now it all comes down to you at the front of the line.

If the ninth prisoner saw an odd number of black hats, that can only mean one thing.
You'll find that this strategy works for any possible arrangement of the hats. The first
prisoner has a 50% chance of giving a wrong answer about his own hat, but the parity
information he conveys allows everyone else to guess theirs with absolute certainty. Each
begins by expecting to see an odd or even number of hats of the specified color. If what
they count doesn't match, that means their own hat is that color. And everytime this
happens, the next person in line will switch the parity they expect to see. So that's it,
you're free to go. It looks like these aliens will have to go hungry, or find some less
logical organisms to abduct.
