title: What happened when I open-sourced my brain cancer
speaker: Salvatore Iaconesi
description: >-
 When artist Salvatore Iaconesi was diagnosed with brain cancer, he refused to be
 a passive patient -- which, he points out, means "one who waits." So he hacked
 his brain scans, posted them online, and invited a global community to pitch in
 on a "cure." This sometimes meant medical advice, and it sometimes meant art,
 music, emotional support -- from more than half a million people.

This back here was my brain cancer. Isn't it nice? 

The key phrase is "was," phew. 

Having brain cancer was really, as you can imagine, shocking news for me. I knew nothing
about cancer. In Western cultures, when you have cancer, it's as if you disappear in a
way. Your life as a complex human being is replaced by medical data: Your images, your
exams, your lab values, a list of medicines. And everyone changes as well. You suddenly
become a disease on legs. Doctors start speaking a language which you don't understand.
They start pointing their fingers at your body and your images. People start changing as
well because they start dealing with the disease, instead of with the human being. They
say, "What did the doctor say?" before even saying, "Hello."And in the meanwhile, you're
left with questions to which nobody gives an answer. These are the "Can I?" questions: Can
I work while I have cancer? Can I study? Can I make love? Can I be creative? And you
wonder, "What have I done to deserve this?" You wonder, "Can I change something about my
lifestyle?" You wonder, "Can I do something?

Are there any other options?"And, obviously, doctors are the good guys in all these
scenarios, because they are very professional and dedicated to curing you. But they also
are very used to having to deal with patients, so I'd say that they sometimes lose the
idea that this is torture for you and that you become, literally, a patient — "patient"
means "the one who waits." 

Things are changing, but classically, they tend to not engage you in any way to learn
about your condition, to get your friends and family engaged, or showing you ways in which
you can change your lifestyle to minimize the risks of what you're going through. But
instead, you're forced there to wait in the hands of a series of very professional
strangers. While I was in the hospital, I asked for a printed-out picture of my cancer and
I spoke with it. It was really hard to obtain, because it's not common practice to ask for
a picture of your own cancer. I talked to it and I said, "Okay, cancer, you're not all
there is to me. There's more to me. A cure, whichever it is, will have to deal with the
whole of me." And so, the next day, I left the hospital against medical advice. I was
determined to change my relationship with the cancer and I was determined to learn more
about my cancer before doing anything as drastic as a surgery. I'm an artist, I use several
forms of open-source technologies and open information in my practice.

So my best bet was to get it all out there, get the information out there, and use it so
that it could be accessed by anyone. So I created a website, which is called La Cura, on
which I put my medical data, online. I actually had to hack it and that's a thing which we
can talk about in another speech. 

I chose this word, La Cura — La Cura in Italian means "the cure" — because in many
different cultures, the word "cure" can mean many different things. In our Western
cultures, it means eradicating or reversing a disease, but in different cultures, for
example, a culture from Asia, from the Mediterranean, from Latin countries, from Africa,
it can mean many more things. Of course, I was interested in the opinions of doctors and
healthcare providers, but I was also interested in the cure of the artist, of the poet, of
the designer, of, who knows, the musicians. I was interested in the social cure, I was
interested in the psychological cure, I was interested in the spiritual cure, I was
interested in the emotional cure, I was interested in any form of cure. And, it worked. The
La Cura website went viral. I received lots of media attention from Italy and from abroad
and I quickly received more than 500,000 contacts — emails, social networking — most of
them were a suggestion on how to cure my cancer, but more of them were about how to cure
myself as a full individual.

For example, many thousands of videos, images, pictures, art performances were produced
for La Cura. For example, here we see Francesca Fini in her performance. Or, as artist
Patrick Lichty has done: He produced a 3D sculpture of my tumor and put it on sale on
Thingiverse. Now you can have my cancer, too! 

Which is a nice thing, if you think about it, we can share our cancer. And this was going
on — scientists, the traditional medicine experts, several researchers, doctors — all
connected with me to give advice. With all this information and support, I was able to
form a team of several neurosurgeons, traditional doctors, oncologists, and several
hundred volunteers with whom I was able to discuss the information I was receiving, which
is very important. And together, we were able to form a strategy for my own cure in many
languages, according to many cultures. And the current strategy spans the whole world and
thousands of years of human history, which is quite remarkable for me. [Surgery]The
follow-up MRIs showed, luckily, little to no growth of the cancer. So I was able to take
my time and choose. I chose the doctor I wanted to work with, I chose the hospital I
wanted to stay in, and in the meanwhile, I was supported by thousands of people, none of
whom felt pity for me.

Everyone felt like they could take an active role in helping me to get well, and this was
the most important part of La Cura. What are the outcomes? I'm fine, as you can see, pretty
fine. 

I had excellent news after the surgery — I have — I had a very low-grade glioma, which is
a "good" kind of cancer which doesn't grow a lot. I have completely changed my life and my
lifestyle. Everything I did was thoughtfully designed to get me engaged. Up until the very
last few minutes of the surgery, which was very intense, a matrix of electrodes was
implanted in my brain from this side, to be able to build a functional map of what the
brain controls. And right before the operation, we were able to discuss the functional map
of my brain with the doctor, to understand which risks I was running into and if there
were any I wanted to avoid. Obviously, there were. [Open]And this openness was really the
fundamental part of La Cura. Thousands of people shared their stories, their experiences.
Doctors got to talk with people they don't usually consult when they think about cancer.
I'm a self-founding, continuous state of translation among many different languages, in
which science meets emotion and conventional research meets traditional
research.

[Society]The most important thing of La Cura was to feel like a part of a really engaged
and connected society whose wellness really depends on the wellness of all of its
components. This global performance is my open-source cure for cancer. And from what I
feel, it's a cure for me, but for us all. Thank you.
