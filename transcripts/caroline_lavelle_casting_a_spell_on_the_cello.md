title: Casting a spell on the cello
speaker: Caroline Lavelle
description: >-
 Caroline Lavelle plays the cello like a sorceress casting a spell, occasionally
 hiding behind her wild mane of blond hair as she sings of pastoral themes. She
 performs "Farther than the Sun," backed by Thomas Dolby on keyboards.

Thank you very much. Now, I've got a story for you. When I arrived off the plane, after a
very long journey from the West of England, my computer, my beloved laptop, had gone mad,
and had — oh! — a bit like that! — and the display on it — anyway, the whole thing had
burst. And I went to the IT guys here and a gentleman mended my computer, and then he
said, "What are you doing here?" and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of
singing," and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well." And I said, "Do you
really?" Anyway, so you're in for a treat, because he's fantastic, and his name's
Mark.

I am also joined by my partner in crime, Thomas Dolby.

This song is called "Farther than the Sun."

♫ Strung in the wind I called you ♫♫ but you did not hear ... ♫♫ And you're a plant that
needs poor soil ♫♫ and I have treated you too well ♫♫ to give up flowers ... ♫♫ Oh, I have
been too rich for you ... ♫♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫♫ Farther than I'd have you be
♫♫ And I go north, I get so cold ♫♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫
You are not worthy ... ♫♫ With your calculating eyes ♫♫ spinning figures ♫♫ you cannot see
me ♫♫ You cannot see me ... ♫♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫♫ I'll believe it ♫♫ You are
not worthy ♫♫ The sea, it freezes over ... ♫♫ to trap the light ♫♫ And I'm in love with
being in love ♫♫ and you were never quite the one ♫♫ In Gerda's eyes ♫♫ Fragments of what
you've become ♫♫ And all the moths that fly at night ♫♫ believe electric light is bright
♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ With your calculating eyes ♫♫ Spinning
figures ♫♫ You cannot see me, no ♫♫ And if I tell myself enough ♫♫ I'll believe it ♫♫ You
are not worthy ♫♫ Farther than the sun from me ♫♫ Farther than I'd have you be ♫♫ And I go
north, I get so cold ♫♫ My heart is lava under stone ♫♫ You are not worthy ♫♫ You are not
worthy ♫♫ With your calculating eyes ♫♫ Spinning figures ♫♫ You cannot see me, no
...

♫♫ And if I tell myself enough, I'll believe it ♫

Thank you very much.
