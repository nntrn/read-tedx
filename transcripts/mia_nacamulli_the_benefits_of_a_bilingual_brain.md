title: The benefits of a bilingual brain
speaker: Mia Nacamulli
description: >-
 It's obvious that knowing more than one language can make certain things easier —
 like traveling or watching movies without subtitles. But are there other
 advantages to having a bilingual (or multilingual) brain? Mia Nacamulli details
 the three types of bilingual brains and shows how knowing more than one language
 keeps your brain healthy, complex and actively engaged. [Directed by TED-Ed,
 narrated by Pen-Pen Chen].

¿Hablas español? Parlez-vous français? 你会说中文吗？ If you answered, "sí," "oui," or "会" and
you're watching this in English, chances are you belong to the world's bilingual and
multilingual majority. And besides having an easier time traveling or watching movies
without subtitles, knowing two or more languages means that your brain may actually look
and work differently than those of your monolingual friends. So what does it really mean
to know a language? Language ability is typically measured in two active parts, speaking
and writing, and two passive parts, listening and reading. While a balanced bilingual has
near equal abilities across the board in two languages, most bilinguals around the world
know and use their languages in varying proportions. And depending on their situation and
how they acquired each language, they can be classified into three general types. For
example, let's take Gabriella, whose family immigrates to the US from Peru when she's
two-years old.

As a compound bilingual, Gabriella develops two linguistic codes simultaneously, with a
single set of concepts, learning both English and Spanish as she begins to process the
world around her. Her teenage brother, on the other hand, might be a coordinate bilingual,
working with two sets of concepts, learning English in school, while continuing to speak
Spanish at home and with friends. Finally, Gabriella's parents are likely to be
subordinate bilinguals who learn a secondary language by filtering it through their
primary language. Because all types of bilingual people can become fully proficient in a
language regardless of accent or pronunciation, the difference may not be apparent to a
casual observer. But recent advances in brain imaging technology have given
neurolinguists a glimpse into how specific aspects of language learning affect the
bilingual brain. It's well known that the brain's left hemisphere is more dominant and
analytical in logical processes, while the right hemisphere is more active in emotional
and social ones, though this is a matter of degree, not an absolute split.

The fact that language involves both types of functions while lateralization develops
gradually with age, has lead to the critical period hypothesis. According to this theory,
children learn languages more easily because the plasticity of their developing brains
lets them use both hemispheres in language acquisition, while in most adults, language is
lateralized to one hemisphere, usually the left. If this is true, learning a language in
childhood may give you a more holistic grasp of its social and emotional contexts.
Conversely, recent research showed that people who learned a second language in adulthood
exhibit less emotional bias and a more rational approach when confronting problems in the
second language than in their native one. But regardless of when you acquire additional
languages, being multilingual gives your brain some remarkable advantages. Some of these
are even visible, such as higher density of the grey matter that contains most of your
brain's neurons and synapses, and more activity in certain regions when engaging a second
language.

The heightened workout a bilingual brain receives throughout its life can also help delay
the onset of diseases, like Alzheimer's and dementia by as much as five years. The idea of
major cognitive benefits to bilingualism may seem intuitive now, but it would have
surprised earlier experts. Before the 1960s, bilingualism was considered a handicap that
slowed a child's development by forcing them to spend too much energy distinguishing
between languages, a view based largely on flawed studies. And while a more recent study
did show that reaction times and errors increase for some bilingual students in
cross-language tests, it also showed that the effort and attention needed to switch
between languages triggered more activity in, and potentially strengthened, the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This is the part of the brain that plays a large role in
executive function, problem solving, switching between tasks, and focusing while filtering
out irrelevant information.

So, while bilingualism may not necessarily make you smarter, it does make your brain more
healthy, complex and actively engaged, and even if you didn't have the good fortune of
learning a second language as a child, it's never too late to do yourself a favor and
make the linguistic leap from, "Hello," to, "Hola," "Bonjour" or "你好’s" because when it
comes to our brains a little exercise can go a long way.
