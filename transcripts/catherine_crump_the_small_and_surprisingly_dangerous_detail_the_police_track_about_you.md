title: The small and surprisingly dangerous detail the police track about you
speaker: Catherine Crump
description: >-
 A very unsexy-sounding piece of technology could mean that the police know where
 you go, with whom, and when: the automatic license plate reader. These cameras
 are innocuously placed all across small-town America to catch known criminals,
 but as lawyer and TED Fellow Catherine Crump shows, the data they collect in
 aggregate could have disastrous consequences for everyone the world over.

The shocking police crackdown on protestors in Ferguson, Missouri, in the wake of the
police shooting of Michael Brown, underscored the extent to which advanced military
weapons and equipment, designed for the battlefield, are making their way to small-town
police departments across the United States. Although much tougher to observe, this same
thing is happening with surveillance equipment. NSA-style mass surveillance is enabling
local police departments to gather vast quantities of sensitive information about each
and every one of us in a way that was never previously possible. Location information can 
be very sensitive. If you drive your car around the United States, it can reveal if you go
 to a therapist, attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, if you go to church or if you
don't go to church. And when that information about you is combined with the same
information about everyone else, the government can gain a detailed portrait of how
private citizens interact. This information used to be private.

Thanks to modern technology, the government knows far too much about what happens behind
closed doors. And local police departments make decisions about who they think you are
based on this information. One of the key technologies driving mass location tracking is
the innocuous-sounding Automatic License Plate Reader. If you haven't seen one, it's
probably because you didn't know what to look for â€” they're everywhere. Mounted on roads
or on police cars, Automatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car
and convert the license plate into machine-readable text so that they can be checked
against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing. But more than that,
increasingly, local police departments are keeping records not just of people wanted for
wrongdoing, but of every plate that passes them by, resulting in the collection of mass
quantities of data about where Americans have gone.

Did you know this was happening? When Mike Katz-Lacabe asked his local police department
for information about the plate reader data they had on him, this is what they got: in
addition to the date, time and location, the police department had photographs that
captured where he was going and often who he was with. The second photo from the top is a
picture of Mike and his two daughters getting out of their car in their own driveway. The
government has hundreds of photos like this about Mike going about his daily life. And if
you drive a car in the United States, I would bet money that they have photographs like
this of you going about your daily life. Mike hasn't done anything wrong. Why is it okay
that the government is keeping all of this information? The reason it's happening is
because, as the cost of storing this data has plummeted, the police departments simply
hang on to it, just in case it could be useful someday.

The issue is not just that one police department is gathering this information in
isolation or even that multiple police departments are doing it. At the same time, the
federal government is collecting all of these individual pots of data, and pooling them
together into one vast database with hundreds of millions of hits, showing where
Americans have traveled. This document from the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration,
which is one of the agencies primarily interested in this, is one of several that reveal 
the existence of this database. Meanwhile, in New York City, the NYPD has driven police
cars equipped with license plate readers past mosques in order to figure out who is
attending. The uses and abuses of this technology aren't limited to the United States. In
the U.K., the police department put 80-year-old John Kat on a plate reader watch list
after he had attended dozens of lawful political demonstrations where he liked to sit on a
bench and sketch the attendees. License plate readers aren't the only mass location
tracking technology available to law enforcement agents today.

Through a technique known as a cell tower dump, law enforcement agents can uncover who was
using one or more cell towers at a particular time, a technique which has been known to
reveal the location of tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people. Also,
using a device known as a StingRay, law enforcement agents can send tracking signals
inside people's houses to identify the cell phones located there. And if they don't know
which house to target, they've been known to drive this technology around through whole
neighborhoods. Just as the police in Ferguson possess high-tech military weapons and
equipment, so too do police departments across the United States possess high-tech
surveillance gear. Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it's not there. The question
is, what should we do about this? I think this poses a serious civil liberties threat.
History has shown that once the police have massive quantities of data, tracking the
movements of innocent people, it gets abused, maybe for blackmail, maybe for political
advantage, or maybe for simple voyeurism. Fortunately, there are steps we can
take.

Local police departments can be governed by the city councils, which can pass laws
requiring the police to dispose of the data about innocent people while allowing the
legitimate uses of the technology to go forward. Thank you.
