title: The city of walls: Constantinople
speaker: Lars Brownworth
description: >-
 The world owes much of its cultural legacy to Constantinople's walls. When
 Constantinople was under siege by neighboring enemies, the Roman city's elaborate
 system of moats, outer walls, and inner walls stood tall. Surviving numerous fire
 attacks, the walls were eventually brought down by more modern tools of warfare,
 but, thankfully, classical culture survived. [Directed by Henrik Axlund & Petri
 Ruikka, narrated by Lars Brownworth].

The most important walls in western history aren't even in the West. They surround the
modern city of Istanbul, Constantinople as the Romans called it. And for a thousand years,
the fate of Europe depended on them. Constantinople was designed to be the center of the
world. When the frontiers of the Roman Empire began to crumble in the 4th Century, the
capital was moved to the cultured, wealthy, and still stable East. There, at the
crossroads between Europe and Asia, the hub of the major trade routes of the ancient
world, the Emperor Constantine built his city. This was the city of libraries and
universities, 20 times the size of London or Paris at the time. It contained the priceless
knowledge of the classical world which was fading in the West. To protect this masterpiece
from its many enemies, Constantine's successors built the finest defensive fortifications
ever made. The first line of protection was a moat 60 feet wide and 22 feet deep,
stretching all four miles from coast to coast.

Pipes from inside the city could fill it at the first sight of the enemy, and a short wall
protected archers who could fire at the soaked soldiers trying to swim across. Those who
were lucky enough to clear the moat had to contend with an unceasing barrage from the 27
foot outer wall above. Arrows, spears, or far worse, Greek fire — an ancient form of
napalm that would ignite on contact and couldn't be extinguished by water — would rain
down on them. Squads of Roman defenders would carry portable flame throwers, spraying
anyone trying to climb out of the moat. The terrified victims would leap back, only to
find that they still burned underwater. At times, the Romans would also mount siphons onto
the ramparts, and launch clay pots full of Greek fire from catapults at an invading army.
The front lines would turn into an inferno, making it appear as if the earth itself was on
fire. If, by some miracle, the outer wall was compromised, attackers would be faced with
the final defense: the great inner wall.

These walls were wide enough to have four men ride side by side, allowing troops to be
rushed wherever they were needed. Attilla the Hun, destroyer of civilizations, who named
himself the Scourge of God, took one look at them and turned around. The Avars battled the
walls uselessly til their catapults ran out of rocks. The Turks tried to tunnel under
them, but found the foundations too solid. The Arabs tried to starve the city into
submission, but ran out of food themselves and had to resort to cannibalism. It took the
guns of the modern world to finally bring them down. In 1453, the Turks brought their
super weapon: a monster cannon that could fire a 15 hundred pound stone ball over a mile.
Together with more than a hundred smaller guns, they kept up a steady bombardment day and
night. A section of the old walls collapsed, but even in their death throes they proved
formidable. The rubble absorbed the shock of the cannonballs better than the solid
wall.

It took a month and a half of continuous blasting to finally open a breach. The last Roman
Emperor, Constantine the 11th, drew his sword and jumped into the gap to stop the
onrushing horde, disappearing into legend. The city was taken, and the Roman Empire
finally disappeared. But those broken walls had one last gift. As the survivors fled the
doomed city, they brought with them their precious books and their ancient traditions.
They traveled west to Italy, reintroduced the Greek language and learning to western
Europe, and ignited the Renaissance. Thanks to Constantinople's walls, that pile of brick
and marble that guarded them for so long, we still have our classical past.
