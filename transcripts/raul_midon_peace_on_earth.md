♫ Picture yourself in a world where there's no one else, ♫♫ nobody anywhere. ♫♫ A moment
ago, there were voices and faces to look upon, ♫♫ you can't see them anywhere. ♫♫ Nothing
more to say ♫♫ and no one left to say it to, anyway. ♫♫ Oh, listen to what I say. ♫♫
Everybody can be somebody ♫♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫♫ Everybody can
be somebody. ♫♫ Everybody is free to make a difference in this world. ♫♫ Now picture a
world where the people all feel their worth. ♫♫ Children are everywhere. ♫♫ Now there is a
reason for everyone's time on Earth. ♫♫ Wondering why you should care, yeah. ♫♫ Nothing
more to say ♫♫ and only love can see us through, anyway. ♫♫ Oh, listen what I say, yeah.
♫♫ Everybody can be somebody ♫♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫♫ Everybody
can be somebody. ♫♫ Everybody is free to make a difference. ♫♫ You don't have to be a big
celebrity ♫♫ to feel the power, the power in your soul, no.

♫♫ You don't have to be a big star on MTV ♫♫ to realize that in your eyes is a view that
only you can see. ♫♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫♫ Everybody is free to make a difference
in this world. ♫♫ You can make a little difference in this world. ♫♫ I can make a little
difference in this world. ♫♫ She can make a little difference in this world. ♫♫ He can
make a little difference in this world. ♫♫ You can, I can, she can, he can, ♫♫ we can make
a little bit of difference in this world. ♫♫ Everybody gonna make a little ♫♫ little
difference, yeah. ♫♫ Talking 'bout everybody gonna make a little difference. ♫♫ Everybody
gonna make a little difference in this world, ♫♫ oh yeah. ♫

Thank you so much.

This is a song that came about because I think it's difficult to be in the world and not
be aware of what's going on, and the wars and so forth. This song kind of came out of all
of that. And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record, which I still stand by, but
this has got something else in it. It's called "Peace on Earth."♫ There is no hope. ♫♫
There is no future. ♫♫ No faith in God to save the day. ♫♫ There is no reason, no
understanding ♫♫ no sacred place to hide away. ♫♫ There is no earnest conversation. ♫♫ No
words of wisdom from the wise. ♫♫ There is no reconciliation ♫♫ and no collective
compromise. ♫♫ Peace on Earth, ♫♫ that's what we want. ♫♫ Peace on Earth, ♫♫ that's what
we all say. ♫♫ Peace on Earth. ♫♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫♫
He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫♫ and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫♫
There is no darkness, no sunshine. ♫♫ There is no great society. ♫♫ There is no freedom
without conviction.

♫♫ There is no freedom to be free. ♫♫ There is no heaven, no fire and brimstone. ♫♫ There
is no brotherhood of man. ♫♫ There is no country, no one religion. ♫♫ There is no
universal plan. ♫♫ Peace on Earth, ♫♫ that's what we want. ♫♫ Peace on Earth, ♫♫ that's
what we all say. ♫♫ Peace on Earth. ♫♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫♫ lurks the ghost of
war. ♫♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫♫ and more, and more, and more, and
more, and more. ♫♫ The answer is ♫♫ mutual-assured destruction, ♫♫ a balance of power, ♫♫
a weapon for everyone. ♫♫ Mutual-assured destruction ♫♫ bringing peace to everyone.
♫(Trumpet sounds)(Trumpet sounds)♫ Peace on Earth, ♫♫ that's what we want. ♫♫ Peace on
Earth, ♫♫ that's what we all say. ♫♫ Peace on Earth. ♫♫ There in the hallway, ♫♫ peace on
Earth. ♫♫ Peace on Earth. ♫♫ Peace on Earth. ♫
