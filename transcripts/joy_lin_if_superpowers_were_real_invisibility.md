speaker: Joy Lin

 What if invisibility wasn't just the stuff of epic comic book stories? Is it
 scientifically possible to be invisible? In this series Joy Lin tackles six
 superpowers and reveals just how scientifically realistic they can be to us mere
 mortals. [Directed by Cognitive Media, narrated by James Arnold Taylor].

Wouldn't it be great if we could be invisible? Ha, right? I mean, we could spy on people
without being noticed and do whatever we want without being held responsible. Now,
magicians have figured out how to utilize full-sized mirrors to bend light in order to
create disappearing illusions. Scientists have created metamaterials to guide rays of
light around tiny, two-dimensional objects. Cameras can also film what is behind you and
project the image so you appear invisible from the front. However, none of these options
can make an object as large as a person appear invisible for all angles and distances
while its moving. But if you are truly invisible, as in from within, here are a few
problems you may not have thought about before. To move around undetected by other people,
you would have to be totally naked. Even if it's freezing outside! You can't carry
anything, including your wallet and keys, otherwise people would just see your wallet and
keys floating around.

Drivers and people on the street can't see you either, therefore they can and will run
into you at some point. Oh, and you better not wear any perfume or make any noise
breathing, otherwise they'll know you're there. And, just because you start off invisible,
doesn't mean you'll stay that way. What if someone accidentally spills scolding hot coffee
on you? And what if it rains? But if you think only liquid can make you visible, you're
wrong. Dust consists of dead skin cells from humans, soil particles, and fibers from
clothes made from cotton and other materials. Dust sticks to the moisture on our skin when
we sweat and the tiny hairs on our skin when we are dry. So, even if you are invisible,
dust would still land on every part of you. We usually don't notice the dust on our skin
because we can't see a thin layer of dust on top of our skin color. But, if you're
invisible, people would see a human-shaped blob of dust walking around with extremely
dirty soles.

Gross! What do you think the world looks like if you are invisible? Well, the answer is
nothing. The reason you can't see in the dark is because there is no light. To see an
apple, light has to hit the apple and return it to your eyes. Then, the retinas in your
eyes catch the light reflection for your brain to interpret into the image of an apple. If
you're invisible, then, by definition, light would travel through you or around you
instead of bouncing off you for people to see. But that means that retinas in your eyes
are not catching the light, either. Therefore, your brain has nothing to interpret into an
image. Can you see your reflection without a mirror to stop the light? No. So, when you
can't be seen by others, you also cannot see. Ouch! Now, have you given any thought as of
whether the invisibility is permanent? If it is, how can you receive medical treatment
from a doctor if you're injured?

The doctor wouldn't know where to apply ointments or bandages because they cannot access
your injury. For that matter, you can't see it either. I mean, what if you have an illness
or an infection? How can the doctor diagnose you without being able to see the color
change or inflammation? And what if everyone is permanently invisible? Well, think about
how boring the world would be without seeing people on the streets, on TV, or at home on
your computer like right now. It's lonely being invisible. Now, which superpower physics
lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and content, super speed, flight, super
strength, immortality, and invisibility.
