title: Robots that "show emotion"
speaker: David Hanson
description: >-
 David Hanson's robot faces look and act like yours: They recognize and respond to
 emotion, and make expressions of their own. Here, an "emotional" live demo of the
 Einstein robot offers a peek at a future where robots truly mimic humans.

I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character. And by that, I mean that I
develop robots that are characters, but also robots that will eventually come to empathize
with you. So we're starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these
conversational character robots that can see faces, make eye contact with you, make a full
range of facial expressions, understand speech and begin to model how you're feeling and
who you are, and build a relationship with you. I developed a series of technologies that
allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved, on
lower power, which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids. So, it's a full
range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face, running on
very small batteries, extremely lightweight. The materials that allowed the
battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber, and it actually
has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen.

One is hierarchical pores, and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the
material. There he's starting to walk. This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science
and Technology. I built the head. They built the body. So the goal here is to achieve
sentience in machines, and not just sentience, but empathy. We're working with the Machine
Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego. They have this really remarkable facial
expression technology that recognizes facial expressions, what facial expressions you're
making. It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation. We're emulating
all the major facial expressions, and then controlling it with the software that we call
the Character Engine. And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in
that. In fact, right now â€” plug it from here, and then plug it in here, and now let's see
if it gets my facial expressions. Okay. So I'm smiling.

Now I'm frowning. And this is really heavily backlit. Okay, here we go. Oh, it's so sad.
Okay, so you smile, frowning. So his perception of your emotional states is very important
for machines to effectively become empathetic. Machines are becoming devastatingly capable
of things like killing. Right? Those machines have no place for empathy. And there is
billions of dollars being spent on that. Character robotics could plant the seed for
robots that actually have empathy. So, if they achieve human level intelligence or, quite
possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence, this could be the seeds of hope for
our future. So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting
my Ph. D. And then I started Hanson Robotics, which has been developing these things for
mass manufacturing. This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of
years ago. And it sees multiple people in a scene, remembers where individual people are,
and looks from person to person, remembering people. So, we're involving two
things.

One, the perception of people, and two, the natural interface, the natural form of the
interface, so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot. You start to
believe that it's alive and aware. So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this
stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer
Philip K. Dick, who wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" which
was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner." In these stories, robots often think that
they're human, and they sort of come to life. So we put his writings, letters, his
interviews, correspondences, into a huge database of thousands of pages, and then used
some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.
And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things that just sounded like they
really understood you. And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing,
which is a little character that's a spokesbot for friendly artificial intelligence,
friendly machine intelligence.

And we're getting this mass-manufactured. We specked it out to actually be doable with a
very, very low-cost bill of materials, so that it can become a childhood companion for
kids. Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years. As artificial
intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence. Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. That's
incredible.
