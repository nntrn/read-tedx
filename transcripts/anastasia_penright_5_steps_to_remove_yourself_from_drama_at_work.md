Alright. I have a close, tight-knit circle of friends. We're all in different cities and
we're all in different areas, from local news to city government to law, financial
services ... And despite those different areas, we seem to share similar stories of
workplace drama. Now, I define workplace drama as an annoyance that adds additional stress
to the job. So again, it's when people get on your nerves, not the job itself. So as we're
going through these stories, I'm realizing there has to be a better way for us to coexist
with our coworkers without this much drama. So I created a few steps that have been
working for me, and I'm happy to share them with you guys today. Step 1: rewind and
reflect, also known as, "What did I do?" I want you guys to all replay your most recent
workplace drama situation in your head like a movie. Ignore all of the emotion and just
focus on you. But for now, let's just think about this hypothetical: say you're on a group
project, you each have your own individual assignments and then you all divide up the
work.

But then someone becomes unresponsive — not answering calls, they go ghost. Then you or
someone else has to now pick up that additional slack. So in a brief, small, very tiny
lapse in judgment, you vent to the nearby coworker. Then all of a sudden, your ghost comes
back, and they surprisingly know everything you just said.

Now, what did I do in this situation? I vented to someone who was not my confidant. Why
would I do that? Sometimes we create this unspoken bond with people that only exists in
our heads. They don't owe me their discretion. I just assumed it was there. So we're not
going to go down a rabbit hole, trying to figure out why they did that. It doesn't matter.
They did it. But the goal in this step is self-reflection. We need to focus on what did we
do so we can avoid it in the future. Step 2: come back to reality, also known as, "It needs
to stop."

So you guys ever think about problems before you get to work? Oh — it's just
me?

Well, I'm guilty of it. I think about all of these situations in my head, and then I get
mad just thinking about it. So I'm telling myself, "No, you're just being prepared,
Stacy."

"You are just making sure that you can handle whatever they're about to throw at you." But
you're not. What you're really doing is setting yourself up and creating this anxiety in
your head that doesn't exist. Then we also have to be careful about listening to other
people's made-up scenarios. Here's what I mean. Let's say you're in the break room, and
you're talking to some coworkers. Then, all of a sudden, another coworker comes in. Now,
they seem to just be in deep thought — not overly cheerful, but they're not rude. They
come in, they walk out. Then the coworkers over here begin to diagnose what they feel is
wrong with that person. They're saying things like, "Oh, they're just mad they didn't get
the job." Or they're saying, "Oh, no, no, no — during this season, they're just always
upset." And you're sitting here like, yep, that must be it. You're listening to this as if
this is facts. Meanwhile, this coworker can be in deep thought about literally
anything.

They could have just opened a pack of Starburst, got four yellows back-to-back, and
they're just trying to figure out what happened.

But you're over here listening. And you're listening to their made-up scenario that now
can impact how you choose to interact with that person throughout the day. Whether we're
creating fake stories in our head or listening to other people's made-up stories, it needs
to stop. The goal in this step: stop stressing over things that haven't happened. Alright.
Step 3: vent and release. It's good to have a vent buddy. This is your coach, your
cheerleader, your therapist, whatever you need them to be in the moment. This is not like
that person in Step 1 that just happened to be in earshot. You have an established
relationship with your vent buddy. Now, here's another scenario. You're getting ready to
tell a customer or a client something that they just don't want to hear. So, as you're in
the middle of this spiel, up comes another coworker, and they interrupt you and then says
the exact same thing you were saying. You can't make a scene in front of a
customer.

So you just have to sit back, "Mm-hmm," and just listen as they do this. And you're
burning up inside. So what do we do? We go to our vent buddy. We talk about it. We get
mad. And that's the time for that. Get mad. Get angry. Curse, scream, do whatever you need
to do to get it out. Now here's the hard part: you then have to switch that tone to
positivity. I truly believe in positive and negative energy, and it has a way of
controlling our moods throughout the day. You've got to think of things like, "OK, where
do I go from here? What can I do differently?" And then, if you're the vent buddy, it's
your responsibility to lead your friend back to the positive. Now, the other hard part: you
have to then apply those learnings to the situation. You can't carry that resentment
around. If you do, that one-off situation now becomes a pattern. Pattern behavior is
harder to ignore than a one-off situation.

The goal in this step is, "Let's turn our vent session into a productive
conversation."Step 4: learn a new language, also known as, "We need to talk." Guys, I
personally don't like to pick up the phone at work. I just don't. I feel like whatever you
need to say to me can be an instant message or an email. That is my work
language.

The only problem with that, you can't hear tone through an email. I read emails the same
way I speak, so I'm pretty sure I've misinterpreted some tones before, unless I know you.
So here's an example. I'm going to show you guys an email, and I want you to read it, and
then I'm going to read it out loud. Alright, that was fast enough, you should have read
it.

"Stacy, Thank you for reading out about my group. At this time, we will not need any
additional support. Going forward, if I feel we need help, I'll ask, you won't have to
reach out. Per my last email (attached below), I've outlined what I do, and what you do,
so we can avoid this in the future. As always, thank you for your partnership!!"Guys
...

That's how you read it?

Guys, there are certain words in there that if you hear or if you see in an email, it is
safe to assume they typed it with their middle fingers.

I didn't know it then. I know it now.

I think I messed up some people's emails. They're correcting them.

With all of that said, you have to know when it is time to pick up the phone. You have to
know when it is time to have a face-to-face. And these face-to-face conversations are not
easy. They are difficult, but they are necessary. The goal is to try to understand the
other person's perspective. So you'll start the conversation with things like, "OK, you
got upset when I ..." Or you'll say things like, "OK, you already had the situation
handled, and then I ..." So that way, you can see exactly where they're coming from. Also,
don't try to make people like you. We all have our own upbringings. We all have our
experiences. And we all have our own communication styles. As the new generations are
entering the workforce, we're also adapting to it. Meetings are now emails. Emails are now
texts. Off-sites are now Skype. So as we're adjusting to that, we need to at least try to
understand what type of style of communication they use.

The goal in that step is to really understand their work language and accept the fact that
it may be different than yours. Step 5: recognize and protect, also known as, "We need to
take a walk." So here's my last scenario from one of my teacher friends. You're about to
have a meeting with a parent, and prior to it, you and a coworker, you kind of discuss it,
and the coworker tells you, "It's alright, I got your back. I'm going to agree with your
recommendations." So you're kind of side-eyeing them because they've burned you before,
but you've had the "we need to talk," so you're like, "We're in sync now, I'm going to
trust them." You go through the meeting, the parent disagrees with you, and like
clockwork, the coworker agrees with the parent in front of you, making you look
ridiculous. Again, we can't make a scene in front of people, right? So you've got to hold
it in. And then, after the meeting, that same coworker has all the audacity, comes up to
you and says, "Crazy meeting, right?"

Yeah. They're testing you now. It's a test. 

So that's the perfect time to just go off, right? This is a repeat offender.

You walked away, and they came back with it. But we're trying to avoid workplace drama, not
take a cannonball leap into it, so we have to walk away. You lead that conversation by
taking the first available exit. You're not doing this for them. You're doing this for
you. You have to protect your energy. Don't try to figure out why they would do this, and
no more coming-to-Jesus conversations. It is what it is, they did what they did, and given
the opportunity, they'd probably do it again. But you now know that. You now recognize
that. So that way, you can act accordingly. We typically try to set expectations — our
expectations — on other people, and then get disappointed when they don't follow through.
We have to learn to accept people where they are and adjust ourselves to handle those
situations. The goal in this step is to recognize when it is time to professionally walk
away from someone. Guys, I realize these steps may come off as saying, "Take the high
road." And people always say it.

"Just take the high road." And they describe it as some elegant path of righteousness
filled with rainbows and unicorns. It's not that. It's embarrassing. It's humiliating. It
leaves this knot of resentment in the pit of your stomach. And as you're traveling down
this amazing high road, you see billboards of things you shoulda said and things you
shoulda did. You go over there and you look at the easy road, and they're chillin', not
worried about a thing. But I have to admit, the more I travel down this road, it does get a
little easier. Petty situations, they don't bother me as much. I learn little nuggets here
and there. And as I continue down this path, there seem to be more opportunities waiting
for me. I have like-minded people who want to connect with me, projects that people want
me on, leaders reaching out because they heard about me through someone else. And the best
part? The need to even look at the easy road is no longer there. Guys, we're not going to
change the way adults act in the workplace.

We are not. And for that reason, there will always be workplace drama. But if we stick to
these steps and put in the work that comes with it, we can learn to avoid it. Guys, thank
you for being my vent buddies.

And thank you so much for your time.
