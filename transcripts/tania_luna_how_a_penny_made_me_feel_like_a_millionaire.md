title: How a penny made me feel like a millionaire
speaker: Tania Luna
description: >-
 As a young child, Tania Luna left her home in post-Chernobyl Ukraine to take
 asylum in the US. And one day, on the floor of the New York homeless shelter
 where she and her family lived, she found a penny. She has never again felt so
 rich. A meditation on the bittersweet joys of childhood -- and how to hold them
 in mind.

I'm five years old, and I am very proud. My father has just built the best outhouse in our
little village in Ukraine. Inside, it's a smelly, gaping hole in the ground, but outside,
it's pearly white formica and it literally gleams in the sun. This makes me feel so proud,
so important, that I appoint myself the leader of my little group of friends and I devise
missions for us. So we prowl from house to house looking for flies captured in spider webs
and we set them free. Four years earlier, when I was one, after the Chernobyl accident,
the rain came down black, and my sister's hair fell out in clumps, and I spent nine months
in the hospital. There were no visitors allowed, so my mother bribed a hospital worker.
She acquired a nurse's uniform, and she snuck in every night to sit by my side. Five years
later, an unexpected silver lining. Thanks to Chernobyl, we get asylum in the U.S. I am
six years old, and I don't cry when we leave home and we come to America, because I expect
it to be a place filled with rare and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate and
Bazooka bubble gum, Bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside, Bazooka
that we'd get once a year in Ukraine and we'd have to chew one piece for an entire
week.

So the first day we get to New York, my grandmother and I find a penny in the floor of the
homeless shelter that my family's staying in. Only, we don't know that it's a homeless
shelter. We think that it's a hotel, a hotel with lots of rats. So we find this penny kind
of fossilized in the floor, and we think that a very wealthy man must have left it there
because regular people don't just lose money. And I hold this penny in the palm of my
hand, and it's sticky and rusty, but it feels like I'm holding a fortune. I decide that
I'm going to get my very own piece of Bazooka bubble gum. And in that moment, I feel like
a millionaire. About a year later, I get to feel that way again when we find a bag full of
stuffed animals in the trash, and suddenly I have more toys than I've ever had in my whole
life. And again, I get that feeling when we get a knock on the door of our apartment in
Brooklyn, and my sister and I find a deliveryman with a box of pizza that we didn't
order.

So we take the pizza, our very first pizza, and we devour slice after slice as the
deliveryman stands there and stares at us from the doorway. And he tells us to pay, but we
don't speak English. My mother comes out, and he asks her for money, but she doesn't have
enough. She walks 50 blocks to and from work every day just to avoid spending money on bus
fare. Then our neighbor pops her head in, and she turns red with rage when she realizes
that those immigrants from downstairs have somehow gotten their hands on her pizza.
Everyone's upset. But the pizza is delicious. It doesn't hit me until years later just how
little we had. On our 10 year anniversary of being in the U.S., we decided to celebrate by
reserving a room at the hotel that we first stayed in when we got to the U.S. The man at
the front desk laughs, and he says, "You can't reserve a room here. This is a homeless
shelter." And we were shocked. My husband Brian was also homeless as a
kid.

His family lost everything, and at age 11, he had to live in motels with his dad, motels
that would round up all of their food and keep it hostage until they were able to pay the
bill. And one time, when he finally got his box of Frosted Flakes back, it was crawling
with roaches. But he did have one thing. He had this shoebox that he carried with him
everywhere containing nine comic books, two G.I. Joes painted to look like Spider-Man and
five Gobots. And this was his treasure. This was his own assembly of heroes that kept him
from drugs and gangs and from giving up on his dreams. I'm going to tell you about one
more formerly homeless member of our family. This is Scarlett. Once upon a time, Scarlet
was used as bait in dog fights. She was tied up and thrown into the ring for other dogs to
attack so they'd get more aggressive before the fight. And now, these days, she eats
organic food and she sleeps on an orthopedic bed with her name on it, but when we pour
water for her in her bowl, she still looks up and she wags her tail in
gratitude.

Sometimes Brian and I walk through the park with Scarlett, and she rolls through the
grass, and we just look at her and then we look at each other and we feel gratitude. We
forget about all of our new middle-class frustrations and disappointments, and we feel
like millionaires. Thank you.
