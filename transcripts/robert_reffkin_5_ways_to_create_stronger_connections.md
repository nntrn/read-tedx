So when was the last time that you wrote a handwritten note? It's probably been a
while.[The Way We Work]Technology has changed the way we communicate. We send emails, not
letters, text messages, not phone calls. We order delivery instead of cooking dinners in
our kitchen. All in the name of efficiency. But here's the point. Technology has made it
easier to communicate. But it hasn't made it easier to connect with other human
beings. I've found that the secret to connecting in the high-tech, fast-paced world that we
live in, is doing a few small things the old-fashioned way. Write a letter. I've written
thousands of handwritten notes. Thanking people for advice, thanking them for an
interview. It just puts that extra effort to show someone that you really care and that
you're willing to go above and beyond. Some advice for writing a thank-you letter is to
really make it clear to the person that you're writing to the impact that they have had on
your life. Talk about something specific.

Like "Thank you for the advice that you gave me. It's because of the advice you gave me,
that I am now doing x." People are looking to make a difference. And so if you can show
someone that they've really had an impact on the life that you're living, the life you're
pursuing, it could have a huge impact. Pick up the phone and dial. We've hired thousands of
employees. And I've personally called every single one of them to welcome them to the
Compass family. I'm able to set the tone of really what I want the company to be. Where,
you know, people go above and beyond to make people feel welcomed and to give people a
sense of belonging. And sometimes I call people on their last day of work. When people
leave, sometimes they're more transparent than they ever were when they were still at the
company. And so it's a great opportunity to get feedback that is very hard to get
otherwise. Ask interesting and meaningful questions when you get outside of the
office.

When I'm traveling the country, every night I'll have dinner with people in the company.
And I like to ask questions like "What's your underlying motivation? What's something
that's happened this week that meant a lot to you?" And when you go around the table, and
people really open up and are able to engage, it sets a different tone. When people come
back to the office, they can see each other and they know each other in a deeper
way. Answer questions with honesty. You know how it feels when you go into an elevator and
someone says, "How was your weekend?" It could've been the best weekend ever, you could've
met the love of your life, and you would say, "Good, how was yours?" If you want to
connect with people, then you have to open up. I'm not always that good at it, and I
imagine most people aren't. But that's why being open stands out so much, because most
people aren't. Turn the video on. I would always recommend a videoconference over a phone
call.

Because that's when you can see the real personality come out. When you're on video,
you're forced to be present. It's almost a forcing mechanism to be in the moment. Nobody
succeeds alone. The more you can take time to develop genuine, authentic relationships,
the more you're going to be able to realize your dreams. You're going to be able to take
big risks and know that there's a network of people to cheer you on and to support your
efforts.
