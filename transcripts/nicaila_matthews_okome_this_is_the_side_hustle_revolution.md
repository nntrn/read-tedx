title: This is the side hustle revolution
speaker: Nicaila Matthews Okome
description: >-
 Past generations found a company to work for and then stayed there for decades.
 But today, we rarely stay in the same job (let alone on the same career path) and
 we don't rely on a single income stream. The tools and resources are out there
 for us to do our own thing, and more of us are going with the entrepreneurial
 spirit -- even if it's on the side of a traditional job. Podcaster and marketer
 Nicaila Matthews Okome helps survey the scene.

I can't think of anyone who just has one interest in life, and that's all they want to do
for the rest of their life.[The Way We Work]Around 15 percent of American workers don't
have traditional full-time jobs. They're half-time, part-time, contract workers or temps.
The term "side hustle" just seems to fit with this ethos where people are putting together
a few different things to make a living. The word "side hustle" has its roots in popular
African American newspapers. In the 1920s, these papers used the word "hustle" to refer to
some kind of scam. By the 1950s, they were using "side hustle" to refer to legitimate
work, too. A side hustle is a little different than a second job. A second job is about
necessity. While a side hustle can certainly bring in extra income, it's a little more
aspirational. Side hustle captures a certain kind of scrappy, entrepreneurial spirit. I've
interviewed more than 100 women of color on Side Hustle Pro who started successful side
hustles.

Nailah Ellis-Brown started Ellis Island Tea out of her trunk. Arsha Jones started her
famous Capital City Co Mambo Sauce with one product and a PayPal link. All these women are
running side hustles. What exactly does this tell us? First, that people are seeing
opportunity within their communities. The goal here isn't necessarily to be the next
Coca-Cola or Google. Scale is great, but there's also beauty in a successful business
that's built for a specific audience. Second, people are increasingly interested in being
their own boss. Being your own boss takes discipline. Self-made millionaires tend to have
one big trait in common: they make decisions, hold themselves accountable and push through
in the face of challenges. A side hustle is a great way to try out being your own boss and
see if you have those skills before fully stepping out on your own. Third, people are
multipassionate. I want to stress that not every side hustle is started because someone
hates their job.

Many are started simply because people are interested in lots of different things. Lisa
Price, who started a hair and beauty company, Carol's Daughter, was working in television
production when she started side-hustling. She says she actually loved her job. It was the
fact that she came home every day feeling good that led her to start experimenting with
making fragrances and hair oils in her kitchen. We're always being taught that we're
supposed to know what we want to do when we grow up. But when you're multipassionate, you
want to dip and dabble in those different things. It doesn't mean that you're not
committed to your job, it just means that you have other outlets that bring you joy. And
that brings me to the final thing the side hustle revolution shows us: people want to make
a bet on themselves. Side hustles are appealing because it's easier to take that chance
when you have some kind of income coming in.

Even if a side hustle doesn't take off, it's still an investment in yourself. Forty-one
percent of millennials who have a side hustle say they've shared this information with
their employers. They're not worried about their managers reacting negatively. They
recognize all the learning and growth that comes with running a side hustle. Everyone is
looking to feel fulfilled. Thirty-eight percent of baby boomers feel some kind of regret
about their career. No one wants that. The truth is that there are many different ways to
find happiness through what we do. Side hustles are about embracing that hope that we can
be the ones making the decisions in how we spend our work lives.
