title: How octopuses battle each other
speaker: Greg Gage
description: >-
 Them's fighting words if you're an octopus, in that more than one octopus in a
 space often means a rumble. Our intrepid neuroscientists analyze aggression by
 observing the fighting behavior of two-spotted octopuses or, if you prefer,
 octopodes.

Greg Gage: The octopus is a rather strange-looking animal that exhibits amazingly complex
behaviors. They have the most impressive nervous system in the entire invertebrate world.
They have about a half a billion neurons that are distributed throughout their body, such
that two-thirds of the neurons are actually in its legs. Now mix this in with camouflaging
cells, jet propulsion and a razor-sharp beak, and you have all the makings of a formidable
predator. And then throw in the fact that the octopus is a solitary creature, and
suddenly, we have ourselves a real cephalopod fight.

[DIY Neuroscience]We know that almost all animals fight — for food, for territory, for
mates. The octopus is no different, and knowing their fighting behavior could help us
better understand these fascinating creatures and how they interact. My friend Ilya has
been observing the classic fighting behavior between California two-spot octopuses. Ilya
Chugunov: Most people think that it's "octopi," but that's actually incorrect. The correct
plurals are either "octopuses" or "octopodes" if you want to be very Greek about it. GG: So
how do you do your experiment? IC: First, I like to set up the chamber just so it's ready,
so I get a jug of water, I aerate it by shaking the jug. It seems that if the water is
well-aerated, they're a lot more active. This gives the octopuses some room to breathe. I
get the first octopus — Here, buddy. Here, pal. Put it in, set up my GoPro, put the second
octopus in, cover it up and leave it alone.(Bell ringing)Rule 1: There's always an
aggressor. There's always one octopus on defense, one on offense.

Usually the one that's taking up more space, that's more boastful, definitely the
aggressor, most likely the winner of the fight. The loser's pretty obvious. They get
pushed around, they curl up, hide in a corner. A lot of the time, when there's initial
contact, if one of them is too much on the defensive side, the second one will sort of
poke at it, grab at its tentacle and see, "Hey, do you want to fight me, do you want to
turn around? Do you want to start a wrestling match?" So it'll just poke and run away.
Come back, poke and run away.(Bell ringing)Rule 2: Avoid eye contact. When the octopuses
come towards each other to begin the fight, they don't actually face each other. They
approach sideways. The defensive octopus tries to face away from the attacker until it's
the critical moment it knows there's no way to avoid a fight. GG: Really, the one who's
waiting to the last moment is the defensive octopus.(Bell ringing)Rule 3: Flash your
colors.

The aggressor in a fight will quickly and sharply flash bright black on his arms when he's
about to initiate a fight.(Bell ringing)GG: Ooh, and already —IC: We're seeing some
action. Looks like they've spotted each other. GG: Right. So now he's going to come — He's
approaching, but not directly at him. IC: Yeah, they're like almost completely
antiparallel. GG: And then right there —IC: Yeah. They contact, and then their arms clash
together.(String music)GG: So we've taken the first steps in understanding fighting in the
octopus. And you might be asking yourself: Why does this even matter? Well, these types of
curiosity-based research questions can often lead to some unexpected insights and
discoveries. We've learned a lot about ourselves from studying marine animals. Squid have
taught us about how our neurons communicate, and the horseshoe crab has taught us about
how our eyes work. So it's not too far of a stretch to say that some of these behaviors
that we're seeing in the California two-spot octopus are similar to ours.
