In 1972, Thomas Sankara was swept into a revolution for a country not his own. Hailing
from the West African nation of Burkina Faso— then known as Upper Volta— the 22-year-old
soldier had travelled to Madagascar to study at their military academy. But upon
arriving, he found a nation in conflict. Local revolutionaries sought to wrest control
of Madagascar from France’s lingering colonial rule. These protestors inspired Sankara to
read works by socialist leaders like Karl Marx and seek wisdom from military strategy.
When he returned to Upper Volta in 1973, Sankara was determined to free his country from
its colonial legacy. Born in 1949, Sankara was raised in a relatively privileged household
as the third of ten children. His parents wanted him to be a priest, but like many of his
peers, Sankara saw the military as the perfect institution to rid Upper Volta of
corruption. After returning from Madagascar, he became famous for his charisma and
transparent oratorial style— but he was less popular with the reigning government. Led by
President Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo, this administration came to power in the 3rd
consecutive coup d’état in Upper Volta’s recent history.

The administration’s policies were a far cry from the sweeping changes Sankara proposed,
but, by 1981, Sankara’s popularity won out, earning him a role in Ouédraogo’s
government. Nicknamed “Africa’s Che Guevara," Sankara rapidly rose through the ranks, and
within two years, he was appointed Prime Minister. In his new role, he delivered
rallying speeches to impoverished communities, women, and young people. He even tried to
persuade other governments to form alliances based on their shared colonial legacy. But
Ouédraogo and his advisors felt threatened by Sankara’s new position. They thought his
communist beliefs would harm alliances with capitalist countries, and just months after
becoming Prime Minister, Ouédraogo’s administration forced Sankara from the job and
placed him on house arrest. Little did the President know this act would fuel Upper Volta’s
 4th coup d’état in 17 years.

Civilian protests ensued around the capital, and the government ground to a halt while
Sankara tried to negotiate a peaceful transition. During this time, Blaise Compaoré,
Sankara’s friend and fellow former soldier, foiled another coup that included an attempt
on Sankara’s life. Eventually, Ouédraogo resigned without further violence, and on August
4, 1983, Thomas Sankara became the new President of Upper Volta. Finally in charge, 
Sankara launched an ambitious program for social and economic change. As one of his first
agenda items, he renamed the country from its French colonial title "Upper Volta" to
"Burkina Faso," which translates to “Land of Upright Men." Over the next four years he
established a nation-wide literacy campaign, ordered the planting of over 10 million
trees, and composed a new national anthem— all while cutting down inflated government
employee salaries. But perhaps the most unique element of Sankara’s revolution was his
dedication to gender equality.

He cultivated a movement for women’s liberation, outlawing forced marriages, polygamy
and genital mutilation. He was the first African leader to appoint women to key political
positions and actively recruit them to the military. However, Sankara’s socialist policies 
were met with much resistance. Many students and elites believed his economic plans would
alienate Burkina Faso from its capitalist peers. His crackdown on the misuse of public
funds turned government officials against him as well. After four years, what began as
an empowering revolution had isolated many influential Burkinabes. But Sankara was not
ready to yield his power. He executed increasingly authoritarian actions, including
banning trade unions and the free press. Eventually, his autocratic tendencies turned
even his closest friends against him. On October 15, 1987, Sankara was conducting a
meeting when a group of assailants swarmed his headquarters.

Sankara was assassinated in the attack, and many believe the raid was ordered by his
friend Blaise Compaoré.Though his legacy is complicated, many of Sankara’s policies have
proven themselves to be ahead of their time. In the past decade, Burkinabe youth have
celebrated Sankara’s political philosophy, and nearby countries like Ghana have even 
adopted Sankara’s economic models. On March 2, 2019 a statue of Sankara was erected in
Burkina Faso’s capital, establishing his place as an icon of revolution for his country
and throughout the world.
