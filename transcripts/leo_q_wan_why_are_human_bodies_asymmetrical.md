title: Why are human bodies asymmetrical?
speaker: Leo Q. Wan
description: >-
 Symmetry is everywhere in nature. And we usually associate it with beauty: a
 perfectly shaped leaf or a butterfly with intricate patterns mirrored on each
 wing. But it turns out that asymmetry is pretty important, too â€” and more common
 than you might think. Leo Q. Wan takes us into the human body to show how
 biological asymmetry can be quite beautiful. [Directed by Echo Bridge Pictures,
 narrated by Addison Anderson].

Symmetry is everywhere in nature, and we usually associate it with beauty: a perfectly
shaped leaf, or a butterfly with intricate patterns mirrored on each wing. But it turns
out that asymmetry is pretty important, too, and more common than you might think, from
crabs with one giant pincer claw to snail species whose shells' always coil in the same
direction. Some species of beans only climb up their trellises clockwise, others, only
counterclockwise, and even though the human body looks pretty symmetrical on the outside,
it's a different story on the inside. Most of your vital organs are arranged
asymmetrically. The heart, stomach, spleen, and pancreas lie towards the left. The
gallbladder and most of your liver are on the right. Even your lungs are different. The
left one has two lobes, and the right one has three. The two sides of your brain look
similar, but function differently. Making sure this asymmetry is distributed the right way
is critical.

If all your internal organs are flipped, a condition called situs inversus, it's often
harmless. But incomplete reversals can be fatal, especially if the heart is involved. But
where does this asymmetry come from, since a brand-new embryo looks identical on the right
and left. One theory focuses on a small pit on the embryo called a node. The node is
lined with tiny hairs called cilia, while tilt away from the head and whirl around
rapidly, all in the same direction. This synchronized rotation pushes fluid from the right
side of the embryo to the left. On the node's left-hand rim, other cilia sense this fluid
flow and activate specific genes on the embryo's left side. These genes direct the cells
to make certain proteins, and in just a few hours, the right and left sides of the embryo
are chemically different. Even though they still look the same, these chemical differences
are eventually translated into asymmetric organs. Asymmetry shows up in the heart
first.

It begins as a straight tube along the center of the embryo, but when the embryo is
around three weeks old, the tube starts to bend into a c-shape and rotate towards the
right side of the body. It grows different structures on each side, eventually turning
into the familiar asymmetric heart. Meanwhile, the other major organs emerge from a
central tube and grow towards their ultimate positions. But some organisms, like pigs,
don't have those embryonic cilia and still have asymmetric internal organs. Could all
cells be intrinsically asymmetric? Probably. Bacterial colonies grow lacy branches that
all curl in the same direction, and human cells cultured inside a ring-shaped boundary
tend to line up like the ridges on a cruller. If we zoom in even more, we see that many 
of cells' basic building blocks, like nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars, are inherently
asymmetric. Proteins have complex asymmetric shapes, and those proteins control which way
cells migrate and which way embryonic cilia twirl.

These biomolecules have a property called chirality, which means that a molecule and its
mirror image aren't identical. Like your right and left hands, they look the same, but
trying to put your right in your left glove proves they're not. This asymmetry at the
molecular level is reflected in asymmetric cells, asymmetric embryos, and finally
asymmetric organisms. So while symmetry may be beautiful, asymmetry holds an allure of its
own, found in its graceful whirls, its organized complexity, and its striking
imperfections.
