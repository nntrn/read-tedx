I started my journey 30 years ago. And I worked in mines. And I realized that this was a
world unseen. And I wanted, through color and large format cameras and very large prints,
to make a body of work that somehow became symbols of our use of the landscape, how we use
the land. And to me this was a key component that somehow, through this medium of
photography, which allows us to contemplate these landscapes, that I thought photography
was perfectly suited to doing this type of work. And after 17 years of photographing large
industrial landscapes, it occurred to me that oil is underpinning the scale and speed.
Because that is what has changed, is the speed at which we're taking all our resources.
And so then I went out to develop a whole series on the landscape of oil. And what I want
to do is to kind of map an arc that there is extraction, where we're taking it from the
ground, refinement.

And that's one chapter. The other chapter that I wanted to look at was how we use it — our
cities, our cars, our motorcultures, where people gather around the vehicle as a
celebration. And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil, this entropic end,
where all of our parts of cars, our tires, oil filters, helicopters, planes — where are
the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up? And to me, again, photography was a way in
which I could explore and research the world, and find those places. And another idea that
I had as well, that was brought forward by an ecologist — he basically did a calculation
where he took one liter of gas and said, well, how much carbon it would take, and how much
organic material? It was 23 metric tons for one liter. So whenever I fill up my gas, I
think of that liter, and how much carbon. And I know that oil comes from the ocean and
phytoplankton, but he did the calculations for our Earth and what it had to do to produce
that amount of energy.

From the photosynthetic growth, it would take 500 years of that growth to produce what we
use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year. And that also brought me to the fact that this
poses such a risk to our society. Looking at 30 billion per year, we look at our two
largest suppliers, Saudi Arabia and now Canada, with its dirty oil. And together they only
form about 15 years of supply. The whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves, only
gives us about 45 years. So, it's not a question of if, but a question of when peak oil
will come upon us. So, to me, using photography — and I feel that all of us need to now
begin to really take the task of using our talents, our ways of thinking, to begin to deal
with what I think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time, how to deal
with our energy crisis. And I would like to say that, on the other side of it, 30, 40 years
from now, the children that I have, I can look at them and say, "We did everything we
possibly, humanly could do, to begin to mitigate this, what I feel is one of the most
important and critical moments in our time.

Thank you.
