title: A musical escape into a world of light and color
speaker: Kaki King
description: >-
 A genre unto herself, Kaki King fuses the ancient tradition of working with one's
 hands with digital technology, projection-mapping imagery onto her guitar in her
 groundbreaking multimedia work "The Neck Is a Bridge to the Body." Using her
 guitar's neck like a keyboard, she plays an intricate melody as she takes the
 audience on a musical journey of light and sound. She calls it "guitar as
 paintbrush."
