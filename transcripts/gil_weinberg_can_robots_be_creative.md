title: Can robots be creative?
speaker: Gil Weinberg
description: >-
 People have been grappling with the question of artificial creativity --
 alongside the question of artificial intelligence -- for over 170 years. For
 instance, could we program machines to create high quality original music? And if
 we do, is it the machine or the programmer that exhibits creativity? Gil Weinberg
 investigates this creative conundrum. [Directed by TOGETHER, narrated by Addison
 Anderson, music by Mason Bretan, Nick Sewell and Shimon the Robot].

How does this music make you feel? Do you find it beautiful? Is it creative? Now, would
you change your answers if you learned the composer was this robot? Believe it or not,
people have been grappling with the question of artificial creativity, alongside the
question of artifcial intelligence, for over 170 years. In 1843, Lady Ada Lovelace, an
English mathematician considered the world's first computer programmer, wrote that a
machine could not have human-like intelligence as long as it only did what humans
intentionally programmed it to do. According to Lovelace, a machine must be able to
create original ideas if it is to be considered intelligent. The Lovelace Test, formalized
in 2001, proposes a way of scrutinizing this idea. A machine can pass this test if it can
produce an outcome that its designers cannot explain based on their original code. The
Lovelace Test is, by design, more of a thought experiment than an objective scientific
test. But it's a place to start.

At first glance, the idea of a machine creating high quality, original music in this way
might seem impossible. We could come up with an extremely complex algorithm using random
number generators, chaotic functions, and fuzzy logic to generate a sequence of musical
notes in a way that would be impossible to track. But although this would yield countless
original melodies never heard before, only a tiny fraction of them would be worth
listening to. With the computer having no way to distinguish between those which we would
consider beautiful and those which we won't. But what if we took a step back and tried to
model a natural process that allows creativity to form? We happen to know of at least one
such process that has lead to original, valuable, and even beautiful outcomes: the process
of evolution. And evolutionary algorithms, or genetic algorithms that mimic biological
evolution, are one promising approach to making machines generate original and valuable
artistic outcomes.

So how can evolution make a machine musically creative? Well, instead of organisms, we
can start with an initial population of musical phrases, and a basic algorithm that mimics
reproduction and random mutations by switching some parts, combining others, and
replacing random notes. Now that we have a new generation of phrases, we can apply
selection using an operation called a fitness function. Just as biological fitness is
determined by external environmental pressures, our fitness function can be determined by
an external melody chosen by human musicians, or music fans, to represent the ultimate 
beautiful melody. The algorithm can then compare between our musical phrases and that
beautiful melody, and select only the phrases that are most similar to it. Once the least
similar sequences are weeded out, the algorithm can reapply mutation and recombination to
what's left, select the most similar, or fitted ones, again from the new generation, and
repeat for many generations.

The process that got us there has so much randomness and complexity built in that the
result might pass the Lovelace Test. More importantly, thanks to the presence of human
aesthetic in the process, we'll theoretically generate melodies we would consider
beautiful. But does this satisfy our intuition for what is truly creative? Is it enough to
make something original and beautiful, or does creativity require intention and awareness
of what is being created? Perhaps the creativity in this case is really coming from the
programmers, even if they don't understand the process. What is human creativity, anyways?
Is it something more than a system of interconnected neurons developed by biological 
algorithmic processes and the random experiences that shape our lives? Order and chaos,
machine and human. These are the dynamos at the heart of machine creativity initiatives
that are currently making music, sculptures, paintings, poetry and more.

The jury may still be out as to whether it's fair to call these acts of creation
creative. But if a piece of art can make you weep, or blow your mind, or send shivers
down your spine, does it really matter who or what created it?
