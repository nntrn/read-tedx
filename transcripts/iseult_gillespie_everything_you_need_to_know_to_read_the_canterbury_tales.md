A portly Miller, barely sober enough to sit on his horse, rambles on about the flighty
wife of a crotchety old carpenter and the scholar she takes as her lover. To get some
time alone together, the scholar and the wife play various tricks that involve feigning
madness, staging a biblical flood, and exposing themselves in public. But the parish clerk
 is also lusting after the wife, and comes by every night to sing outside her house. This
becomes so tiresome that she tries to scare him away by hanging her rear end out the
window for him to kiss. When this appears not to work, her scholar decides to try
farting in the same position, but this time, the clerk is waiting with a red-hot
poker. This might all sound like a bawdy joke, but it’s part of one of the most esteemed 
works of English literature ever created: The Canterbury Tales, which seamlessly blends
the lofty and the lowly. The work consists of 24 stories, each told by one of Chaucer’s
spirited characters.

Narrators include familiar Medieval figures such as a Knight, a Clerk, and a Nun, and the
less recognizable Reeve, and Mancible, and others. The Tales are written in Middle English,
which often looks entirely different from the language spoken today. It was used between
the 12th and 15th centuries, and evolved from Old English due to increased contact with
European romantic languages after the Norman Conquest of 1066. Most of the Middle English
alphabet is still familiar today, with the inclusion of a few archaic symbols, such as
yogh, which denotes the y, j, or gh sound. The loquacious cast of the Tales first meet at
the Tabard Inn in Southwark. They have a journey in common: a pilgrimage to Canterbury to
visit the shrine of St. Thomas Beckett, a martyred archbishop who was murdered in his own
Cathedral. Eager and nosy for some personal details, the host of the Inn proposes a
competition: whoever tells the best tale will be treated to dinner. If not for their
pilgrimage, many of these figures would never have had the chance to interact.

This is because Medieval society followed a feudal system that divided the clergy and
nobility from the working classes, made up of peasants and serfs. By Chaucer’s time, a
professional class of merchants and intellectuals had also emerged. Chaucer spent most of
his life as a government official during the Hundred Years' War, traveling throughout
Italy and France, as well as his native England. This may have influenced the panoramic
vision of his work, and in the Tales, no level of society is above mockery. Chaucer uses
the quirks of the characters’ language – the ribald humor of the Cook, the solemn prose
of the Parson, and the lofty notions of the Squire – to satirize their worldviews. The
varied dialects, genres, and literary tropes also make the work a vivid record of the
different ways Medieval audiences entertained themselves. For instance, the Knight’s tale
 of courtly love, chivalry, and destiny riffs on romance, while the tales of working-class
narrators are generally comedies filled with scatological language, sexual deviance, and
slapstick. This variation includes something for everyone, and that’s one reason why
readers continue to delight in the work in both Middle English and translation.

While the narrative runs to over 17,000 lines, it's apparently unfinished, as the
prologue ambitiously introduces 29 pilgrims and promises four stories apiece, and the
innkeeper never crowns a victor. It’s possible that Chaucer was so caught up in his
sumptuous creations that he delayed picking a winner - or perhaps he was so fond of each
character that he just couldn’t choose. Whatever the reason, this means that every reader
is free to judge; the question of who wins is up to you.
