title: A new way to think about the transition to motherhood
speaker: Alexandra Sacks
description: >-
 When a baby is born, so is a mother -- but the natural (and sometimes unsteady)
 process of transition to motherhood is often silenced by shame or misdiagnosed as
 postpartum depression. In this quick, informative talk, reproductive psychiatrist
 Alexandra Sacks breaks down the emotional tug-of-war of becoming a new mother --
 and shares a term that could help describe it: matrescence.

Do you remember a time when you felt hormonal and moody? Your skin was breaking out, your
body was growing in strange places and very fast, and at the same time, people were
expecting you to be grown-up in this new way. Teenagers, right? Well, these same changes
happen to a woman when she's having a baby. And we know that it's normal for teenagers to
feel all over the place, so why don't we talk about pregnancy in the same way? There are
entire textbooks written about the developmental arc of adolescence, and we don't even
have a word to describe the transition to motherhood. We need one. I'm a psychiatrist who
works with pregnant and postpartum women, a reproductive psychiatrist, and in the decade
that I've been working in this field, I've noticed a pattern. It goes something like this:
a woman calls me up, she's just had a baby, and she's concerned. She says, "I'm not good
at this. I'm not enjoying this.

Do I have postpartum depression?"So I go through the symptoms of that diagnosis, and it's
clear to me that she's not clinically depressed, and I tell her that. But she isn't
reassured. "It isn't supposed to feel like this," she insists. So I say, "OK. What did you
expect it to feel like?" She says, "I thought motherhood would make feel whole and happy.
I thought my instincts would naturally tell me what to do. I thought I'd always want to
put the baby first."This — this is an unrealistic expectation of what the transition to
motherhood feels like. And it wasn't just her. I was getting calls with questions like
this from hundreds of women, all concerned that something was wrong, because they couldn't
measure up. And I didn't know how to help them, because telling them that they weren't
sick wasn't making them feel better. I wanted to find a way to normalize this transition,
to explain that discomfort is not always the same thing as disease. So I set out to learn
more about the psychology of motherhood.

But there actually wasn't much in the medical textbooks, because doctors mostly write
about disease. So I turned to anthropology. And it took me two years, but in an
out-of-print essay written in 1973 by Dana Raphael, I finally found a helpful way to frame
this conversation: matrescence. It's not a coincidence that "matrescence" sounds like
"adolescence." Both are times when body morphing and hormone shifting lead to an upheaval
in how a person feels emotionally and how they fit into the world. And like adolescence,
matrescence is not a disease, but since it's not in the medical vocabulary, since doctors
aren't educating people about it, it's being confused with a more serious condition called
postpartum depression. I've been building on the anthropology literature and have been
talking about matrescence with my patients using a concept called the "push and
pull."Here's the pull part. As humans, our babies are uniquely dependent.

Unlike other animals, our babies can't walk, they can't feed themselves, they're very hard
to take care of. So evolution has helped us out with this hormone called oxytocin. It's
released around childbirth and also during skin-to-skin touch, so it rises even if you
didn't give birth to the baby. Oxytocin helps a human mother's brain zoom in, pulling her
attention in, so that the baby is now at the center of her world. But at the same time, her
mind is pushing away, because she remembers there are all these other parts to her
identity — other relationships, her work, hobbies, a spiritual and intellectual life, not
to mention physical needs: to sleep, to eat, to exercise, to have sex, to go to the
bathroom, alone —

if possible. This is the emotional tug-of-war of matrescence. This is the tension the women
calling me were feeling. It's why they thought they were sick. If women understood the
natural progression of matrescence, if they knew that most people found it hard to live
inside this push and pull, if they knew that under these circumstances, ambivalence was
normal and nothing to be ashamed of, they would feel less alone, they would feel less
stigmatized, and I think it would even reduce rates of postpartum depression. I'd love to
study that one day. I'm a believer in talk therapy, so if we're going to change the way our
culture understands this transition to motherhood, women need to be talking to each other,
not just me. So mothers, talk about your matrescence with other mothers, with your
friends, and, if you have one, with your partner, so that they can understand their own
transition and better support you. But it's not just about protecting your
relationship.

When you preserve a separate part of your identity, you're also leaving room for your
child to develop their own. When a baby is born, so is a mother, each unsteady in their own
way. Matrescence is profound, but it's also hard, and that's what makes it human. Thank
you.
