title: What gives a dollar bill its value?
speaker: Doug Levinson
description: >-
 The value of money is determined by how much (or how little) of it is in
 circulation. But who makes that decision, and how does their choice affect the
 economy at large? Doug Levinson takes a trip into the United States Federal
 Reserve, examining how the people who work there aim to balance the value of the
 dollar to prevent inflation or deflation. [Directed by Qa'ed Mai, narrated by
 Doug Levinson].

If you tried to pay for something with a piece of paper, you might run into some trouble.
Unless, of course, the piece of paper was a hundred dollar bill. But what is it that makes
that bill so much more interesting and valuable than other pieces of paper? After all,
there's not much you can do with it. You can't eat it. You can't build things with it. And
burning it is actually illegal. So what's the big deal? Of course, you probably know the
answer. A hundred dollar bill is printed by the government and designated as official
currency, while other pieces of paper are not. But that's just what makes them legal. What
makes a hundred dollar bill valuable, on the other hand, is how many or few of them are
around. Throughout history, most currency, including the US dollar, was linked to valuable
commodities and the amount of it in circulation depended on a government's gold or silver
reserves.

But after the US abolished this system in 1971, the dollar became what is known as fiat
money, meaning not linked to any external resource but relying instead solely on
government policy to decide how much currency to print. Which branch of our government sets
this policy? The Executive, the Legislative, or the Judicial? The surprising answer is:
none of the above! In fact, monetary policy is set by an independent Federal Reserve
System, or the Fed, made up of 12 regional banks in major cities around the country. Its
board of governors, which is appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate,
reports to Congress, and all the Fed's profit goes into the US Treasury. But to keep the
Fed from being influenced by the day-to-day vicissitudes of politics, it is not under the
direct control of any branch of government. Why doesn't the Fed just decide to print
infinite hundred dollar bills to make everyone happy and rich? Well, because then the
bills wouldn't be worth anything.

Think about the purpose of currency, which is to be exchanged for goods and services. If
the total amount of currency in circulation increases faster than the total value of goods
and services in the economy, then each individual piece will be able to buy a smaller
portion of those things than before. This is called inflation. On the other hand, if the
money supply remains the same, while more goods and services are produced, each dollar's
value would increase in a process known as deflation. So which is worse? Too much inflation
means that the money in your wallet today will be worth less tomorrow, making you want to
spend it right away. While this would stimulate business, it would also encourage
overconsumption, or hoarding commodities, like food and fuel, raising their prices and
leading to consumer shortages and even more inflation. But deflation would make people
want to hold onto their money, and a decrease in consumer spending would reduce business
profits, leading to more unemployment and a further decrease in spending, causing the
economy to keep shrinking.

So most economists believe that while too much of either is dangerous, a small, consistent
amount of inflation is necessary to encourage economic growth. The Fed uses vast amounts of
economic data to determine how much currency should be in circulation, including previous
rates of inflation, international trends, and the unemployment rate. Like in the story of
Goldilocks, they need to get the numbers just right in order to stimulate growth and keep
people employed, without letting inflation reach disruptive levels. The Fed not only
determines how much that paper in your wallet is worth but also your chances of getting or
keeping the job where you earn it.
