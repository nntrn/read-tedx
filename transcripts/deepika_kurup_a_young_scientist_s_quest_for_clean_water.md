title: A young scientist's quest for clean water
speaker: Deepika Kurup
description: >-
 Deepika Kurup has been determined to solve the global water crisis since she was
 14 years old, after she saw kids outside her grandparents' house in India
 drinking water that looked too dirty even to touch. Her research began in her
 family kitchen -- and eventually led to a major science prize. Hear how this
 teenage scientist developed a cost-effective, eco-friendly way to purify
 water.

Every summer, my family and I travel across the world, 3,000 miles away to the culturally
diverse country of India. Now, India is a country infamous for its scorching heat and
humidity. For me, the only relief from this heat is to drink plenty of water. Now, while
in India, my parents always remind me to only drink boiled or bottled water, because
unlike here in America, where I can just turn on a tap and easily get clean, potable
water, in India, the water is often contaminated. So my parents have to make sure that the
water we drink is safe. However, I soon realized that not everyone is fortunate enough to
enjoy the clean water we did. Outside my grandparents' house in the busy streets of India,
I saw people standing in long lines under the hot sun filling buckets with water from a
tap. I even saw children, who looked the same age as me, filling up these clear plastic
bottles with dirty water from streams on the roadside.

Watching these kids forced to drink water that I felt was too dirty to touch changed my
perspective on the world. This unacceptable social injustice compelled me to want to find
a solution to our world's clean water problem. I wanted to know why these kids lacked
water, a substance that is essential for life. And I learned that we are facing a global
water crisis. Now, this may seem surprising, as 75 percent of our planet is covered in
water, but only 2.5 percent of that is freshwater, and less than one percent of Earth's
freshwater supply is available for human consumption. With rising populations, industrial
development and economic growth, our demand for clean water is increasing, yet our
freshwater resources are rapidly depleting. According to the World Health Organization,
660 million people in our world lack access to a clean water source. Lack of access to
clean water is a leading cause of death in children under the age of five in developing
countries, and UNICEF estimates that 3,000 children die every day from a water-related
disease. So after returning home one summer in eighth grade, I decided that I wanted to
combine my passion for solving the global water crisis with my interest in
science.

So I decided that the best thing to do would be to convert my garage into a
laboratory.

Actually, at first I converted my kitchen into a laboratory, but my parents didn't really
approve and kicked me out. I also read a lot of journal papers on water-related research,
and I learned that currently in developing countries, something called solar disinfection,
or SODIS, is used to purify water. In SODIS, clear plastic bottles are filled with
contaminated water and then exposed to sunlight for six to eight hours. The UV radiation
from the sun destroys the DNA of these harmful pathogens and decontaminates the water.
Now, while SODIS is really easy to use and energy-efficient, as it only uses solar energy,
it's really slow, as it can take up to two days when it's cloudy. So in order to make the
SODIS process faster, this new method called photocatalysis has recently been used. So what
exactly is this photocatalysis? Let's break it down: "photo" means from the sun, and a
catalyst is something that speeds up a reaction.

So what photocatalysis is doing is it's just speeding up this solar disinfection process.
When sunlight comes in and strikes a photocatalyst, like TiO2, or titanium dioxide, it
creates these really reactive oxygen species, like superoxides, hydrogen peroxide and
hydroxyl radicals. These reactive oxygen species are able to remove bacteria and organics
and a whole lot of contaminants from drinking water. But unfortunately, there are several
disadvantages to the way photocatalytic SODIS is currently deployed. See, what they do is
they take the clear plastic bottles and they coat the inside with this photocatalytic
coating. But photocatalysts like titanium dioxide are actually commonly used in sunscreens
to block UV radiation. So when they're coated on the inside of these bottles, they're
actually blocking some of the UV radiation and diminishing the efficiency of the process.
Also, these photocatalytic coatings are not tightly bound to the plastic bottle, which
means they wash off, and people end up drinking the catalyst.

While TiO2 is safe and inert, it's really inefficient if you keep drinking the catalyst,
because then you have to continue to replenish it, even after a few uses. So my goal was to
overcome the disadvantages of these current treatment methods and create a safe,
sustainable, cost-effective and eco-friendly method of purifying water. What started off
as an eighth grade science fair project is now my photocatalytic composite for water
purification. The composite combines titanium dioxide with cement. The cement-like
composite can be formed into several different shapes, which results in an extremely
versatile range of deployment methods. For example, you could create a rod that can easily
be placed inside water bottles for individual use or you could create a porous filter that
can filter water for families. You can even coat the inside of an existing water tank to
purify larger amounts of water for communities over a longer period of time. Now, over the
course of this, my journey hasn't really been easy.

You know, I didn't have access to a sophisticated laboratory. I was 14 years old when I
started, but I didn't let my age deter me in my interest in pursuing scientific research
and wanting to solve the global water crisis. See, water isn't just the universal solvent.
Water is a universal human right. And for that reason, I'm continuing to work on this
science fair project from 2012 to bring it from the laboratory into the real world. And
this summer, I founded Catalyst for World Water, a social enterprise aimed at catalyzing
solutions to the global water crisis.

Alone, a single drop of water can't do much, but when many drops come together, they can
sustain life on our planet. Just as water drops come together to form oceans, I believe
that we all must come together when tackling this global problem. Thank
you.

Thank you.
