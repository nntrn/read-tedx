title: The boost students need to overcome obstacles
speaker: Anindya Kundu
description: >-
 How can disadvantaged students succeed in school? For sociologist Anindya Kundu,
 grit and stick-to-itiveness aren't enough; students also need to develop their
 agency, or their capacity to overcome obstacles and navigate the system. He
 shares hopeful stories of students who have defied expectations in the face of
 personal, social and institutional challenges.

So, I teach college students about inequality and race in education, and I like to leave
my office open to any of my students who might just want to see me to chat. And a few
semesters ago, one of my more cheerful students, Mahari, actually came to see me and
mentioned that he was feeling a bit like an outcast because he's black. He had just
transferred to NYU from a community college on a merit scholarship, and turns out, only
about five percent of students at NYU are black. And so I started to remember that I know
that feeling of being an outsider in your own community. It's partially what drew me to my
work. At my university, I'm one of the few faculty members of color, and growing up, I
experienced my family's social mobility, moving out of apartments into a nice house, but
in an overwhelmingly white neighborhood. I was 12, and kids would say that were surprised
that I didn't smell like curry.

That's because school is in the morning, and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast.

Curry is for dinner.

So when Mahari was leaving, I asked him how he was coping with feeling isolated. And he
said that despite feeling lonely, he just threw himself at his work, that he built
strategies around his grit and his desire to be successful. A mentor of mine is actually
Dr. Angela Duckworth, the psychologist at UPenn who has defined this stick-to-itiveness of
grit as being "the perseverance and passion for long-term goals." Angela's book has become
a bestseller, and schools across the country, particularly charter schools, have become
interested in citing "grit" as a core value. But sometimes grit isn't enough, especially
in education. So when Mahari was leaving my office, I worried that he might need something
more specific to combat the challenges that he mentioned to me. As a sociologist, I also
study achievement, but from a slightly different perspective. I research students who have
overcome immense obstacles related to their background.

Students from low-income, often single-parent households, students who have been homeless,
incarcerated or perhaps undocumented, or some who have struggled with substance abuse or
lived through violent or sexual trauma. So let me tell you about two of the grittiest
people I've met. Tyrique was raised by a single mother, and then after high school, he
fell in with the wrong crowd. He got arrested for armed robbery. But in prison, he started
to work hard. He took college credit courses, so when he got out, he was able to get a
master's, and today he's a manager at a nonprofit. Vanessa had to move around a lot as a
kid, from the Lower East Side to Staten Island to the Bronx. She was raised primarily by
her extended family, because her own mother had a heroin addiction. Yet at 15, Vanessa had
to drop out of school, and she had a son of her own. But eventually, she was able to go to
community college, get her associate's, then go to an elite college to finish her
bachelor's. So some people might hear these stories and say, "Yes, those two definitely
have grit.

They basically pulled themselves up by the bootstraps." But that's an incomplete picture,
because what's more important is that they had factors in their lives that helped to
influence their agency, or their specific capacity to actually overcome the obstacles that
they were facing and navigate the system given their circumstances. So, allow me to
elaborate. In prison, Tyrique was actually aimless at first, as a 22-year-old on Rikers
Island. This is until an older detainee took him aside and asked him to help with the
youth program. And in mentoring youth, he started to see his own mistakes and
possibilities in the teens. This is what got him interested in taking college-credit
courses. And when he got out, he got a job with Fortune Society, where many executives are
people who have been formerly incarcerated. So then he was able to get a master's in
social work, and today, he even lectures at Columbia about prison reform. And Vanessa
...

well, after the birth of her son, she happened to find a program called Vocational
Foundation that gave her 20 dollars biweekly, a MetroCard and her first experiences with a
computer. These simple resources are what helped her get her GED, but then she suffered
from a very serious kidney failure, which was particularly problematic because she was
only born with one kidney. She spent 10 years on dialysis waiting for a successful
transplant. After that, her mentors at community college had kept in touch with her, and
so she was able to go, and they put her in an honors program. And that's the pathway that
allowed her to become accepted to one of the most elite colleges for women in the country,
and she received her bachelor's at 36, setting an incredible example for her young
son. What these stories primarily indicate is that teaching is social and benefits from
social scaffolding. There were factors pushing these two in one direction, but through
tailored mentorship and opportunities, they were able to reflect on their circumstances
and resist negative influences.

They also learned simple skills like developing a network, or asking for help — things
many of us in this room can forget that we have needed from time to time, or can take for
granted. And when we think of people like this, we should only think of them as
exceptional, but not as exceptions. Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us of the
collective responsibility to help students in similar situations. When Presidents Bush,
Obama and now even Trump, have called education "the civil rights issue of our time,"
perhaps we should treat it that way. If schools were able to think about the agency that
their students have and bring to the table when they push them, what students learn can
become more relevant to their lives, and then they can tap into those internal reservoirs
of grit and character. So this here — My student Mahari got accepted to law school with
scholarships, and not to brag, but I did write one of his letters of recommendation.

And even though I know hard work is what got him this achievement, I've seen him find his
voice along the way, which as someone who's grown up a little bit shy and awkward, I know
it takes time and support. So even though he will rely a lot on his grit to get him
through that first-year law school grind, I'll be there as a mentor for him, check in with
him from time to time, maybe take him out to get some curry ...

so that he can keep growing his agency to succeed even more. Thank you.
