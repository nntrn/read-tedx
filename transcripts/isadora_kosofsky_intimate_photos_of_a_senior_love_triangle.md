Jeanie, Will and Adina are three senior citizens connected by a special relationship. They
view their bond as a shield from the loneliness of aging. I first met them at a retirement
home in Los Angeles, where I had been photographing for three years. I saw as they
approached the gate one night, and felt an immediate connection to them. Although I didn't
know the details of their love triangle, I intuitively felt that I had to find out who
they were. Questioning a nurse a day later, she said to me, "Oh, you're talking about the
threesome."

I was intrigued.

The trio set out on a daily adventure to coffee and doughnut shops, bus stops and street
corners. I soon learned that the purpose of these outings was solace and a search for
meaning. The trio sought to combat their alienation by literally integrating themselves in
public streets. Yet, even when arm in arm, no one saw them. We often think that as we age,
we lose the desires held in our youth. Actually, as a teenage photojournalist when I met
the trio, I saw their behavior as a mirror to the fears of exclusion and desires for
intimacy that I also carried. I related to their invisibility, which pained me during my
childhood but has become my greatest asset as an immersive documentarian, because I can
just fade into my empathy. As we walked down the streets of Hollywood, in a neighborhood
of screenwriters, actors and filmmakers, the trio assumed the invisibility that each
senior does. I would ask myself, "How is it that no one else sees these three human
beings?

Why is it that I am the only one who sees them?"Years later, as I began to share this work
with the public, I noticed that people are largely uncomfortable with this story. Perhaps
it is because the trio doesn't assume conventional notions associated with love, romance
or partnership. They were unseen in public and shunned by their peers. They wanted to
belong somewhere but only seemed to belong with each other. I wanted to belong somewhere,
too. And my camera has been a catalyst for me to belong everywhere. But beyond challenging
sociocultural norms about the elderly, the trio sheds light on fear of remoteness. At the
end of each day, they return to their respective retirement homes. Under the surface of
their aloneness, there is a desire for community, for their people. There was a sense that
they were each yearning for their tribe, but that comfort comes with compromise, because
Will cannot commit to one woman. Sitting with Jeanie one day in her apartment, she said to
me, "Sharing Will is a thorn in your side.

A relationship between a man and a woman is private. It is a couple, not a trio."My
process is to essentially become the people I document by spending years with them as an
observer-occupant, to create a safe space, to then become hidden in plain sight. I was
about 17 when I met the trio, and I shadowed them for four years. We actually see, in the
breakdown of social development, that adolescence and old age look strikingly alike,
because both are periods of identity confusion. I identified with the women. But also with
Will, who made me aware of the divide in me. The schism that we each often have about what
we crave and the actuality of our situation. Before shooting this series, I was also in
love with two different people who knew about each other, being the object over which they
fought. But I also knew what it was like to be at the base of the triangle, like Jeanie or
Adina, asking myself, "Why aren't I enough?" I would look through my viewfinder and see
three elderly figures, and it became impossible to deny that regardless of age, we were
each in pursuit of filling the proverbial hole through other people. Perhaps the discomfort
of looking at Jeanie, Will and Adina's story is truly a reminder that even at the end of
life, we may never reach the fantasy we have envisioned for ourselves.

Thank you for listening.
