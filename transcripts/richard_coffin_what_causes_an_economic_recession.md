For millennia, the people of Britain had been using bronze to make tools and jewelry, and
as a currency for trade. But around 800 BCE, that began to change: the value of bronze
declined, causing social upheaval and an economic crisis— what we would call a recession
today. What causes recessions? This question has long been the subject of heated debate
among economists, and for good reason. A recession can be a mild decline in economic
activity in a single country that lasts months, a long-lasting downturn with global 
ramifications that last years, or anything in between. Complicating matters further, there
are countless variables that contribute to an economy’s health, making it difficult to
pinpoint specific causes. So it helps to start with the big picture: recessions occur when
there is a negative disruption to the balance between supply and demand. There’s a
mismatch between how many goods people want to buy, how many products and services
producers can offer, and the price of the goods and services sold, which prompts an
economic decline. An economy’s relationship between supply and demand is reflected in its
inflation rates and interest rates. Inflation happens when goods and services get more
expensive.

Put another way, the value of money decreases. Still, inflation isn’t necessarily a bad
thing. In fact, a low inflation rate is thought to encourage economic activity. But high
inflation that isn’t accompanied with high demand can both cause problems for an economy 
and eventually lead to a recession. Interest rates, meanwhile, reflect the cost of taking
on debt for individuals and companies. The rate is typically an annual percentage of a
loan that borrowers pay to their creditors until the loan is repaid. Low interest rates
mean that companies can afford to borrow more money, which they can use to invest in
more projects. High interest rates, meanwhile, increase costs for producers and
consumers, slowing economic activity. Fluctuations in inflation and interest rates can
give us insight into the health of the economy, but what causes these fluctuations in
the first place? The most obvious causes are shocks like natural disaster, war, and
geopolitical factors.

An earthquake, for example, can destroy the infrastructure needed to produce important
commodities such as oil. That forces the supply side of the economy to charge more for
products that use oil, discouraging demand and potentially prompting a recession. But some
recessions occur in times of economic prosperity— possibly even because of economic
prosperity. Some economists believe that business activity from a market’s expansion can
occasionally reach an unsustainable level. For example, corporations and consumers may
borrow more money with the assumption that economic growth will help them handle the
added burden. But if the economy doesn’t grow as quickly as expected, they may end up
with more debt than they can manage. To pay it off, they’ll have to redirect funds from
other activities, reducing business activity. Psychology can also contribute to a
recession. Fear of a recession can become a self-fulfilling prophecy if it causes people
to pull back investing and spending.

In response, producers might cut operating costs to help weather the expected decline in
demand. That can lead to a vicious cycle as cost cuts eventually lower wages, leading to
even lower demand. Even policy designed to help prevent recessions can contribute. When
times are tough, governments and central banks may print money, increase spending, and
lower central bank interest rates. Smaller lenders can in turn lower their interest
rates, effectively making debt “cheaper” to boost spending. But these policies are not
sustainable and eventually need to be reversed to prevent excessive inflation. That can
cause a recession if people have become too reliant on cheap debt and government
stimulus. The Bronze recession in Britain eventually ended when the adoption of iron helped
revolutionize farming and food production. Modern markets are more complex, making
today’s recessions far more difficult to navigate.

But each recession provides new data to help anticipate and respond to future recessions
more effectively.
