title: When is a pandemic over?
speaker: Alex Rosenthal
description: >-
 Consider the following scenario: a highly infectious, sometimes deadly respiratory
 virus infects humans for the first time. It spreads rapidly worldwide, and the
 WHO declares a pandemic. The death toll starts to rise and everyone is asking the
 same question: when will the pandemic end? Alex Rosenthal details the three main
 strategies governments can use to contain and end a pandemic. [Directed by

Consider this unfortunately familiar scenario. Several months ago a highly infectious,
sometimes deadly respiratory virus infected humans for the first time. It then
proliferated faster than public health measures could contain it. Now the World Health
Organization (WHO) has declared a pandemic, meaning that it’s spreading worldwide. The
death toll is starting to rise and everyone is asking the same question: when will the
pandemic end? The WHO will likely declare the pandemic over once the infection is mostly
contained and rates of transmission drop significantly throughout the world. But exactly
when that happens depends on what global governments choose to do next. They have three
main options: Race through it, Delay and Vaccinate, or Coordinate and Crush. One is
widely considered best, and it may not be the one you think. In the first, governments and
communities do nothing to halt the spread and instead allow people to be exposed as
quickly as possible.

Without time to study the virus, doctors know little about how to save their patients,
and hospitals reach peak capacity almost immediately. Somewhere in the range of millions 
to hundreds of millions of people die, either from the virus or the collapse of health
care systems. Soon the majority of people have been infected and either perished or
survived by building up their immune responses. Around this point herd immunity kicks in,
where the virus can no longer find new hosts. So the pandemic fizzles out a short time
after it began. But there’s another way to create herd immunity without such a high cost
of life. Let’s reset the clock to the moment the WHO declared the pandemic. This time,
governments and communities around the world slow the spread of the virus to give
research facilities time to produce a vaccine. They buy this crucial time through tactics
that may include widespread testing to identify carriers, quarantining the infected and
people they’ve interacted with, and physical distancing. Even with these measures in place,
 the virus slowly spreads, causing up to hundreds of thousands of deaths.

Some cities get the outbreak under control and go back to business as usual, only to have
a resurgence and return to physical distancing when a new case passes through. Within the
next several years, one or possibly several vaccines become widely, and hopefully freely,
available thanks to a worldwide effort. Once 40-90% of the population has received it—
the precise amount varying based on the virus— herd immunity kicks in, and the pandemic
fizzles out. Let’s rewind the clock one more time, to consider the final strategy:
Coordinate and Crush. The idea here is to simultaneously starve the virus, everywhere,
through a combination of quarantine, social distancing, and restricting travel. The
critical factor is to synchronize responses. In a typical pandemic, when one country is
peaking, another may be getting its first cases. Instead of every leader responding to
what’s happening in their jurisdiction, here everyone must treat the world as the giant
interconnected system it is.

If coordinated properly, this could end a pandemic in just a few months, with low loss of
life. But unless the virus is completely eradicated— which is highly unlikely— there will
be risks of it escalating to pandemic levels once again. And factors like animals
carrying and transmitting the virus might undermine our best efforts altogether. So which
strategy is best for this deadly, infectious respiratory virus? Racing through it is a
quick fix, but would be a global catastrophe, and may not work at all if people can be
reinfected. Crushing the virus through Coordination alone is also enticing for its speed,
but only reliable with true and nearly impossible global cooperation. That’s why
vaccination, assisted by as much global coordination as possible, is generally considered
to be the winner; it’s the slow, steady, and proven option in the race. Even if the
pandemic officially ends before a vaccine is ready, the virus may reappear seasonally, so
 vaccines will continue to protect people.

And although it may take years to create, disruptions to most people’s lives won’t
necessarily last the full duration. Breakthroughs in treatment and prevention of symptoms
can make viruses much less dangerous, and therefore require less extreme containment
measures. Take heart: the pandemic will end. Its legacy will be long-lasting, but not all
bad; the breakthroughs, social services, and systems we develop can be used to the
betterment of everyone. And if we take inspiration from the successes and lessons from
the failures, we can keep the next potential pandemic so contained that our children’s
children won’t even know its name.
