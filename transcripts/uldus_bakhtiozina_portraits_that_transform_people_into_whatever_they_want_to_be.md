I'm often asked why I do art, what do I want to say with my art photography, and what is
the use of it? Once in a while I start to worry how to actually measure the impact from
the art like we do with medicine or technology, where we can see the results and calculate
it. Then I would finally be able to explain to my mother my art with real numbers. But my
art is so far from metrics, and moreover, my photography is widely exposing the theme of
escapism. My theory is that all of us struggle sometimes to escape in order to analyze our
reality, appreciate it or change. I don't work with daily life as it is, and I'm not a
documentary photographer in the common sense. But I am a documentary photographer in a
different sense. I document dreams. I work with daily life as it could be, as I imagine
it. I am a daydreamer, but at the same time I love things that are authentic and deal with
our innermost nature, which I would never want to escape from.

I adore complicated personalities, and real life inspires me to create my images. Real
life inspires our escape, and sometimes that escape is very needed. I believe heroes are
not created easily, and I choose to work with individuals who are survivors and facing
everyday routines that are not always full of color, people who are on their way to a
better life, fighting against life circumstances. Why do I choose people like that for my
models? Because I've been in that position myself, when I had to learn how to survive in
real life. I was a student living abroad in London. I was working at two places at the
same time as a waitress. Obviously that wasn't my dream job, but I decided to play a game
where I imagined that I am taking a role in a film, and in the film I am a waitress, and I
need to act great. I used to dye my hair and brows to gingerette, I changed my hair to
curly perm, I lost weight and made myself believe I am just a character acting in a
film.

That isn't forever, that is all just temporary. That helped me a lot. It motivated me to
change my life and take a hard time as a game. Now, as an artist, I am creating different
lives for my models in order to give them the experience of being someone else in reality.
Through the photographic process, all of my models become like silent movie actors. They
are captured at the moment when they believe in being someone else entirely. In order to
create a new reality in its entirety, I physically create every single thing in my work,
sometimes from outfits to the stage. Because I work with analogues, and I don't make any
digital manipulations to my photographs, I need everything to take place in reality, in
spite of the fact that nowadays, digitally, you can create pretty much everything. I don't
like this path. Even if that reaches perfection, I see the beauty in authenticity of
making, and that's impossible without flaws. A digitally manipulated photograph is not
true for me.

It doesn't capture anything real. It's not experienced, not motivating. It's like, instead
of going traveling, you look at someone else's travel photographs. What I find so exciting
is the ability to make people's dreams of being someone else a reality. That's like a drug
which pushes me to keep working, even without metrics. One of my models had always dreamed
of being seen as a warrior, but she wasn't able to do sports because of her health
problems. Half a year ago, she passed away from heart disease at the age of 22. But two
days before her death, the images we spent months working on together of her as a warrior
she dreamed of becoming were published at a large exhibition in Milan by Vogue Magazine.
All her life was about overcoming. Before she died, she had known that thousands of people
saw her image from the land of escapism and believed in her as a brave and fearless
warrior. For my work, I invite people to play a game like we all used to as children when
we pretend to be someone else and that process made us really happy.

To my mind it is important for grown-ups. We need these transformations to enact this in
the name of art. It gives us the very real feeling of being important and powerful in
order to influence our reality. I know this from my own personal experience. I have had so
many versions of myself through my self-portraits that I've been many different
characters. Being someone else in the land of escapism doesn't exactly give us numbers that
we can gauge, but it's like a real lost form of magic which exists but can't be measured.
There is a unique power in art to transform and lift our limits. Art creates what I call a
conjured life, which helps our existence and pushes, motivates and inspires us to dwell
and express ourselves without metrics or calculations. Thank you.
