So the type of magic I like, and I'm a magician, is magic that uses technology to create
illusions. So I would like to show you something I've been working on. It's an application
that I think will be useful for artists — multimedia artists in particular. It
synchronizes videos across multiple screens of mobile devices. I borrowed these three
iPods from people here in the audience to show you what I mean. And I'm going to use them
to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject: deception.

One of my favorite magicians is Karl Germain. He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush
would bloom right in front of your eyes. But it was his production of a butterfly that was
the most beautiful.

Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, the creation of life.

Marco Tempest: When asked about deception, he said this:Announcer: Magic is the only
honest profession. A magician promises to deceive you — and he does. MT: I like to think of
myself as an honest magician. I use a lot of tricks, which means that sometimes I have to
lie to you. Now I feel bad about that. But people lie every day.

Hold on. Phone: Hey, where are you? MT: Stuck in traffic. I'll be there soon. You've all
done it.

Right: I'll be ready in just a minute, darling. Center: It's just what I've always
wanted. Left: You were great. MT: Deception, it's a fundamental part of life. Now polls show
that men tell twice as many lies as women — assuming the women they asked told the
truth.

We deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses. The Chinese general Sun Tzu said
that all war was based on deception. Oscar Wilde said the same thing of romance. Some
people deceive for money. Let's play a game. Three cards, three chances. Announcer: One
five will get you 10, 10 will get you 20. Now, where's the lady? Where is the queen? MT:
This one? Sorry. You lose. Well, I didn't deceive you. You deceived yourself.
Self-deception. That's when we convince ourselves that a lie is the truth. Sometimes it's
hard to tell the two apart. Compulsive gamblers are experts at self-deception.(Slot
machine)They believe they can win. They forget the times they lose. The brain is very good
at forgetting. Bad experiences are quickly forgotten. Bad experiences quickly disappear.
Which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos, we are so wonderfully optimistic. Our
self-deception becomes a positive illusion — why movies are able to take us onto
extraordinary adventures; why we believe Romeo when he says he loves Juliet; and why
single notes of music, when played together, become a sonata and conjure up meaning. That's
"Clair De lune." Its composer, called Debussy, said that art was the greatest deception of
all.

Art is a deception that creates real emotions — a lie that creates a truth. And when you
give yourself over to that deception, it becomes magic.[MAGIC](Music fades
slowly)

Thank you. Thank you very much.
