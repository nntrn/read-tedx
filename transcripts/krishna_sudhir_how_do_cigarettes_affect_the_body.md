Cigarettes aren’t good for us. That’s hardly news—we’ve known about the dangers of
smoking for decades. But how exactly do cigarettes harm us? Let’s look at what happens as
their ingredients make their way through our bodies, and how we benefit physically when
we finally give up smoking. With each inhalation, smoke brings its more than 5,000 
chemical substances into contact with the body’s tissues. From the start, tar, a black,
resinous material, begins to coat the teeth and gums, damaging tooth enamel, and
eventually causing decay. Over time, smoke also damages nerve-endings in the nose,
causing loss of smell. Inside the airways and lungs, smoke increases the likelihood of
infections, as well as chronic diseases like bronchitis and emphysema. It does this by
damaging the cilia, tiny hairlike structures whose job it is to keep the airways clean.
It then fills the alveoli, tiny air sacs that enable the exchange of oxygen and carbon
dioxide between the lungs and blood.

A toxic gas called carbon monoxide crosses that membrane into the blood, binding to
hemoglobin and displacing the oxygen it would usually have transported around the body.
That’s one of the reasons smoking can lead to oxygen deprivation and shortness of
breath. Within about 10 seconds, the bloodstream carries a stimulant called nicotine to
the brain, triggering the release of dopamine and other neurotransmitters including
endorphins that create the pleasurable sensations which make smoking highly addictive.
Nicotine and other chemicals from the cigarette simultaneously cause constriction of
blood vessels and damage their delicate endothelial lining, restricting blood flow. These
vascular effects lead to thickening of blood vessel walls and enhance blood platelet
stickiness, increasing the likelihood that clots will form and trigger heart attacks and
strokes. Many of the chemicals inside cigarettes can trigger dangerous mutations in the
body’s DNA that make cancers form.

Additionally, ingredients like arsenic and nickel may disrupt the process of DNA repair,
thus compromising the body’s ability to fight many cancers. In fact, about one of every
three cancer deaths in the United States is caused by smoking. And it’s not just lung
cancer. Smoking can cause cancer in multiple tissues and organs, as well as damaged
eyesight and weakened bones. It makes it harder for women to get pregnant. And in men, it
can cause erectile dysfunction. But for those who quit smoking, there’s a huge positive
upside with almost immediate and long-lasting physical benefits. Just 20 minutes after a
smoker’s final cigarette, their heart rate and blood pressure begin to return to normal.
After 12 hours, carbon monoxide levels stabilize, increasing the blood’s oxygen-carrying
capacity. A day after ceasing, heart attack risk begins to decrease as blood pressure and
heart rates normalize.

After two days, the nerve endings responsible for smell and taste start to recover. Lungs
become healthier after about one month, with less coughing and shortness of breath. The
delicate hair-like cilia in the airways and lungs start recovering within weeks, and are
restored after 9 months, improving resistance to infection. By the one-year anniversary of
quitting, heart disease risk plummets to half as blood vessel function improves. Five
years in, the chance of a clot forming dramatically declines, and the risk of stroke 
continues to reduce. After ten years, the chances of developing fatal lung cancer go down
by 50%, probably because the body’s ability to repair DNA is once again restored. Fifteen
years in, the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease is essentially the same as
that of a non-smoker. There’s no point pretending this is all easy to achieve. Quitting
can lead to anxiety and depression, resulting from nicotine withdrawal.

But fortunately, such effects are usually temporary. And quitting is getting easier,
thanks to a growing arsenal of tools. Nicotine replacement therapy through gum, skin
patches, lozenges, and sprays may help wean smokers off cigarettes. They work by
stimulating nicotine receptors in the brain and thus preventing withdrawal symptoms,
without the addition of other harmful chemicals. Counselling and support groups,
cognitive behavioral therapy, and moderate intensity exercise also help smokers stay
cigarette-free. That’s good news, since quitting puts you and your body on the path back
to health.
