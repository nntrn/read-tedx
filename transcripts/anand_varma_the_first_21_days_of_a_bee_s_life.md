title: The first 21 days of a bee's life
speaker: Anand Varma
description: >-
 We've heard that bees are disappearing. But what is making bee colonies so
 vulnerable? Photographer Anand Varma raised bees in his backyard — in front of a
 camera — to get an up close view. This project, for National Geographic, gives a
 lyrical glimpse into a beehive, and reveals one of the biggest threats to its
 health, a mite that preys on baby bees in their first 21 days of life. With
 footage set to music from Rob Moose and the Magik*Magik Orchestra, Varma shows
 the problem ... and what's being done to solve it. (This talk was part of a
 session at TED2015 guest-curated by Pop-Up Magazine: popupmagazine.com or
 @popupmag on Twitter.)

These bees are in my backyard in Berkeley, California. Until last year, I'd never kept
bees before, but National Geographic asked me to photograph a story about them, and I
decided, to be able to take compelling images, I should start keeping bees myself. And as
you may know, bees pollinate one third of our food crops, and lately they've been having a
really hard time. So as a photographer, I wanted to explore what this problem really looks
like. So I'm going to show you what I found over the last year. This furry little creature
is a fresh young bee halfway emerged from its brood cell, and bees right now are dealing
with several different problems, including pesticides, diseases, and habitat loss, but the
single greatest threat is a parasitic mite from Asia, Varroa destructor. And this
pinhead-sized mite crawls onto young bees and sucks their blood. This eventually destroys
a hive because it weakens the immune system of the bees, and it makes them more vulnerable
to stress and disease. Now, bees are the most sensitive when they're developing inside
their brood cells, and I wanted to know what that process really looks like, so I teamed
up with a bee lab at U.C.

Davis and figured out how to raise bees in front of a camera. I'm going to show you the
first 21 days of a bee's life condensed into 60 seconds. This is a bee egg as it hatches
into a larva, and those newly hatched larvae swim around their cells feeding on this white
goo that nurse bees secrete for them. Then, their head and their legs slowly differentiate
as they transform into pupae. Here's that same pupation process, and you can actually see
the mites running around in the cells. Then the tissue in their body reorganizes and the
pigment slowly develops in their eyes. The last step of the process is their skin shrivels
up and they sprout hair. 

So — 

As you can see halfway through that video, the mites were running around on the baby bees,
and the way that beekeepers typically manage these mites is they treat their hives with
chemicals. In the long run, that's bad news, so researchers are working on finding
alternatives to control these mites. This is one of those alternatives. It's an
experimental breeding program at the USDA Bee Lab in Baton Rouge, and this queen and her
attendant bees are part of that program. Now, the researchers figured out that some of the
bees have a natural ability to fight mites, so they set out to breed a line of
mite-resistant bees. This is what it takes to breed bees in a lab. The virgin queen is
sedated and then artificially inseminated using this precision instrument. Now, this
procedure allows the researchers to control exactly which bees are being crossed, but
there's a tradeoff in having this much control.

They succeeded in breeding mite-resistant bees, but in that process, those bees started to
lose traits like their gentleness and their ability to store honey, so to overcome that
problem, these researchers are now collaborating with commercial beekeepers. This is Bret
Adee opening one of his 72,000 beehives. He and his brother run the largest beekeeping
operation in the world, and the USDA is integrating their mite-resistant bees into his
operation with the hope that over time, they'll be able to select the bees that are not
only mite-resistant but also retain all of these qualities that make them useful to us. And
to say it like that makes it sound like we're manipulating and exploiting bees, and the
truth is, we've been doing that for thousands of years. We took this wild creature and put
it inside of a box, practically domesticating it, and originally that was so that we could
harvest their honey, but over time we started losing our native pollinators, our wild
pollinators, and there are many places now where those wild pollinators can no longer meet
the pollination demands of our agriculture, so these managed bees have become an integral
part of our food system. So when people talk about saving bees, my interpretation of that
is we need to save our relationship to bees, and in order to design new solutions, we have
to understand the basic biology of bees and understand the effects of stressors that we
sometimes cannot see.

In other words, we have to understand bees up close. Thank you.
