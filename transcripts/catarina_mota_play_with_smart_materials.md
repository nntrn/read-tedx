title: Play with smart materials
speaker: Catarina Mota
description: >-
 Ink that conducts electricity; a window that turns from clear to opaque at the
 flip of a switch; a jelly that makes music. All this stuff exists, and Catarina
 Mota says: It's time to play with it. Mota leads us on a tour of surprising and
 cool new materials, and suggests that the way we'll figure out what they're good
 for is to experiment, tinker and have fun.

I have a friend in Portugal whose grandfather built a vehicle out of a bicycle and a
washing machine so he could transport his family. He did it because he couldn't afford a
car, but also because he knew how to build one. There was a time when we understood how
things worked and how they were made, so we could build and repair them, or at the very
least make informed decisions about what to buy. Many of these do-it-yourself practices
were lost in the second half of the 20th century. But now, the maker community and the
open-source model are bringing this kind of knowledge about how things work and what
they're made of back into our lives, and I believe we need to take them to the next level,
to the components things are made of. For the most part, we still know what traditional
materials like paper and textiles are made of and how they are produced. But now we have
these amazing, futuristic composites â€” plastics that change shape, paints that conduct
electricity, pigments that change color, fabrics that light up.

Let me show you some examples. So conductive ink allows us to paint circuits instead of
using the traditional printed circuit boards or wires. In the case of this little example
I'm holding, we used it to create a touch sensor that reacts to my skin by turning on this
little light. Conductive ink has been used by artists, but recent developments indicate
that we will soon be able to use it in laser printers and pens. And this is a sheet of
acrylic infused with colorless light-diffusing particles. What this means is that, while
regular acrylic only diffuses light around the edges, this one illuminates across the
entire surface when I turn on the lights around it. Two of the known applications for this
material include interior design and multi-touch systems. And thermochromic pigments
change color at a given temperature. So I'm going to place this on a hot plate that is set
to a temperature only slightly higher than ambient and you can see what
happens.

So one of the principle applications for this material is, amongst other things, in baby
bottles, so it indicates when the contents are cool enough to drink. So these are just a
few of what are commonly known as smart materials. In a few years, they will be in many of
the objects and technologies we use on a daily basis. We may not yet have the flying cars
science fiction promised us, but we can have walls that change color depending on
temperature, keyboards that roll up, and windows that become opaque at the flick of a
switch. So I'm a social scientist by training, so why am I here today talking about smart
materials? Well first of all, because I am a maker. I'm curious about how things work and
how they are made, but also because I believe we should have a deeper understanding of the
components that make up our world, and right now, we don't know enough about these
high-tech composites our future will be made of. Smart materials are hard to obtain in
small quantities.

There's barely any information available on how to use them, and very little is said about
how they are produced. So for now, they exist mostly in this realm of trade secrets and
patents only universities and corporations have access to. So a little over three years
ago, Kirsty Boyle and I started a project we called Open Materials. It's a website where
we, and anyone else who wants to join us, share experiments, publish information,
encourage others to contribute whenever they can, and aggregate resources such as research
papers and tutorials by other makers like ourselves. We would like it to become a large,
collectively generated database of do-it-yourself information on smart materials. But why
should we care how smart materials work and what they are made of? First of all, because
we can't shape what we don't understand, and what we don't understand and use ends up
shaping us. The objects we use, the clothes we wear, the houses we live in, all have a
profound impact on our behavior, health and quality of life.

So if we are to live in a world made of smart materials, we should know and understand
them. Secondly, and just as important, innovation has always been fueled by tinkerers. So
many times, amateurs, not experts, have been the inventors and improvers of things ranging
from mountain bikes to semiconductors, personal computers, airplanes. The biggest challenge
is that material science is complex and requires expensive equipment. But that's not
always the case. Two scientists at University of Illinois understood this when they
published a paper on a simpler method for making conductive ink. Jordan Bunker, who had
had no experience with chemistry until then, read this paper and reproduced the experiment
at his maker space using only off-the-shelf substances and tools. He used a toaster oven,
and he even made his own vortex mixer, based on a tutorial by another scientist/maker.
Jordan then published his results online, including all the things he had tried and didn't
work, so others could study and reproduce it.

So Jordan's main form of innovation was to take an experiment created in a well-equipped
lab at the university and recreate it in a garage in Chicago using only cheap materials
and tools he made himself. And now that he published this work, others can pick up where
he left and devise even simpler processes and improvements. Another example I'd like to
mention is Hannah Perner-Wilson's Kit-of-No-Parts. Her project's goal is to highlight the
expressive qualities of materials while focusing on the creativity and skills of the
builder. Electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work, but the
constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn. So Hannah's approach, on
the other hand, is to formulate a series of techniques for creating unusual objects that
free us from pre-designed constraints by teaching us about the materials themselves. So
amongst Hannah's many impressive experiments, this is one of my favorites.

["Paper speakers"] What we're seeing here is just a piece of paper with some copper tape
on it connected to an mp3 player and a magnet. (Music: "Happy Together") So based on the
research by Marcelo Coelho from MIT, Hannah created a series of paper speakers out of a
wide range of materials from simple copper tape to conductive fabric and ink. Just like
Jordan and so many other makers, Hannah published her recipes and allows anyone to copy
and reproduce them. But paper electronics is one of the most promising branches of material
science in that it allows us to create cheaper and flexible electronics. So Hannah's
artisanal work, and the fact that she shared her findings, opens the doors to a series of
new possibilities that are both aesthetically appealing and innovative. So the interesting
thing about makers is that we create out of passion and curiosity, and we are not afraid
to fail. We often tackle problems from unconventional angles, and, in the process, end up
discovering alternatives or even better ways to do things.

So the more people experiment with materials, the more researchers are willing to share
their research, and manufacturers their knowledge, the better chances we have to create
technologies that truly serve us all. So I feel a bit as Ted Nelson must have when, in the
early 1970s, he wrote, "You must understand computers now." Back then, computers were
these large mainframes only scientists cared about, and no one dreamed of even having one
at home. So it's a little strange that I'm standing here and saying, "You must understand
smart materials now." Just keep in mind that acquiring preemptive knowledge about emerging
technologies is the best way to ensure that we have a say in the making of our
future. Thank you.
