title: What is color?
speaker: Colm Kelleher
description: >-
 Have you ever wondered what color is? In this first installment of a series on
 light, Colm Kelleher describes the physics behind colors-- why the colors we see
 are related to the period of motion and the frequency of waves. [Directed by Alex
 Rupert and Bernard Tan, narrated by Colm Kelleher].

One of the most striking properties about life is that it has color. To understand the
phenomenon of color, it helps to think about light as a wave. But, before we get to that,
let's talk a little bit about waves in general. Imagine you're sitting on a boat on the
ocean watching a cork bob up and down in the water. The first thing you notice about the
motion is that it repeats itself. The cork traces the same path over and over again... up
and down, up and down. This repetitive or periodic motion is characteristic of waves. Then
you notice something else... using a stopwatch, you measure the time it takes for the
piece of cork to go over its highest position down to its lowest and then back up again.
Suppose this takes two seconds. To use the physics jargon, you've measured the period of
the waves that cork is bobbing on. That is, how long it takes a wave to go through its
full range of motion once.

The same information can be expressed in a different way by calculating the wave's
frequency. Frequency, as the name suggest, tells you how frequent the waves are. That is,
how many of them go by in one second. If you know how many seconds one full wave takes,
then it's easy to work out how many waves go by in one second. In this case, since each
wave takes 2 seconds, the frequency is 0.5 waves per second. So enough about bobbing
corks... What about light and color? If light is a wave, then it must have a frequency.
Right? Well... yes, it does. And it turns out that we already have a name for the
frequency of the light that our eyes detect. It's called color. That's right. Color is
nothing more than a measure of how quickly the light waves are waving. If our eyes were
quick enough, we might be able to observe this periodic motion directly, like we can with
the cork and the ocean. But the frequency of the light we see is so high, it waves up and
down about 400 million million times a second, that we can't possibly see it as a
wave.

But we can tell, by looking at its color, what its frequency is. The lowest frequency
light that we can see is red and the highest frequency is purple. In between all the other
frequencies form a continuous band of color, called the visible spectrum. So, what if you
had a yellow pencil sitting on your desk? Well, the sun emits all colors of light, so
light of all colors is hitting your pencil. The pencil looks yellow because it reflects
yellow light more than it reflects the other colors. What happens to the blue, purple and
red light? They get absorbed and the energy they are carrying is turned into heat. It is
similar with objects of other colors. Blue things reflect blue light, red things reflect
red light and so on. White objects reflect all colors of light, while black things do
exactly the opposite and absorb at all frequencies. This - by the way - is why it's
uncomfortable to wear your favorite Metallica t-shirt on a sunny day.
