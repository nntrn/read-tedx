title: How germs travel on planes -- and how we can stop them
speaker: Raymond Wang
description: >-
 Raymond Wang is only 17 years old, but he's already helping to build a healthier
 future. Using fluid dynamics, he created computational simulations of how air
 moves on airplanes, and what he found is disturbing -- when a person sneezes on a
 plane, the airflow actually helps to spread pathogens to other passengers. Wang
 shares an unforgettable animation of how a sneeze travels inside a plane cabin as
 well as his prize-winning solution: a small, fin-shaped device that increases
 fresh airflow in airplanes and redirects pathogen-laden air out of circulation.

Can I get a show of hands — how many of you in this room have been on a plane in this past
year? That's pretty good. Well, it turns out that you share that experience with more than
three billion people every year. And when we put so many people in all these metal tubes
that fly all over the world, sometimes, things like this can happen and you get a disease
epidemic. I first actually got into this topic when I heard about the Ebola outbreak last
year. And it turns out that, although Ebola spreads through these more range-limited,
large-droplet routes, there's all these other sorts of diseases that can be spread in the
airplane cabin. The worst part is, when we take a look at some of the numbers, it's pretty
scary. So with H1N1, there was this guy that decided to go on the plane and in the matter
of a single flight actually spread the disease to 17 other people. And then there was this
other guy with SARS, who managed to go on a three-hour flight and spread the disease to 22
other people.

That's not exactly my idea of a great superpower. When we take a look at this, what we also
find is that it's very difficult to pre-screen for these diseases. So when someone
actually goes on a plane, they could be sick and they could actually be in this latency
period in which they could actually have the disease but not exhibit any symptoms, and
they could, in turn, spread the disease to many other people in the cabin. How that
actually works is that right now we've got air coming in from the top of the cabin and
from the side of the cabin, as you see in blue. And then also, that air goes out through
these very efficient filters that eliminate 99.97 percent of pathogens near the outlets.
What happens right now, though, is that we have this mixing airflow pattern. So if someone
were to actually sneeze, that air would get swirled around multiple times before it even
has a chance to go out through the filter.

So I thought: clearly, this is a pretty serious problem. I didn't have the money to go out
and buy a plane, so I decided to build a computer instead. It actually turns out that with
computational fluid dynamics, what we're able to do is create these simulations that give
us higher resolutions than actually physically going in and taking readings in the plane.
And so how, essentially, this works is you would start out with these 2D drawings — these
are floating around in technical papers around the Internet. I take that and then I put it
into this 3D-modeling software, really building that 3D model. And then I divide that
model that I just built into these tiny pieces, essentially meshing it so that the
computer can better understand it. And then I tell the computer where the air goes in and
out of the cabin, throw in a bunch of physics and basically sit there and wait until the
computer calculates the simulation. So what we get, actually, with the conventional cabin
is this: you'll notice the middle person sneezing, and we go "Splat!" — it goes right into
people's faces.

It's pretty disgusting. From the front, you'll notice those two passengers sitting next to
the central passenger not exactly having a great time. And when we take a look at that
from the side, you'll also notice those pathogens spreading across the length of the
cabin. The first thing I thought was, "This is no good." So I actually conducted more than
32 different simulations and ultimately, I came up with this solution right here. This is
what I call a — patent pending — Global Inlet Director. With this, we're able to reduce
pathogen transmission by about 55 times, and increase fresh-air inhalation by about 190
percent. So how this actually works is we would install this piece of composite material
into these existing spots that are already in the plane. So it's very cost-effective to
install and we can do this directly overnight. All we have to do is put a couple of screws
in there and you're good to go. And the results that we get are absolutely
amazing.

Instead of having those problematic swirling airflow patterns, we can create these walls
of air that come down in-between the passengers to create personalized breathing zones. So
you'll notice the middle passenger here is sneezing again, but this time, we're able to
effectively push that down to the filters for elimination. And same thing from the side,
you'll notice we're able to directly push those pathogens down. So if you take a look
again now at the same scenario but with this innovation installed, you'll notice the
middle passenger sneezes, and this time, we're pushing that straight down into the outlet
before it gets a chance to infect any other people. So you'll notice the two passengers
sitting next to the middle guy are breathing virtually no pathogens at all. Take a look at
that from the side as well, you see a very efficient system. And in short, with this
system, we win. When we take a look at what this means, what we see is that this not only
works if the middle passenger sneezes, but also if the window-seat passenger sneezes or if
the aisle-seat passenger sneezes. And so with this solution, what does this mean for the
world?

Well, when we take a look at this from the computer simulation into real life, we can see
with this 3D model that I built over here, essentially using 3D printing, we can see those
same airflow patterns coming down, right to the passengers. In the past, the SARS epidemic
actually cost the world about 40 billion dollars. And in the future, a big disease
outbreak could actually cost the world in excess of three trillion dollars. So before, it
used to be that you had to take an airplane out of service for one to two months, spend
tens of thousands of man hours and several million dollars to try to change something. But
now, we're able to install something essentially overnight and see results right away. So
it's really now a matter of taking this through to certification, flight testing, and
going through all of these regulatory approvals processes. But it just really goes to show
that sometimes the best solutions are the simplest solutions.

And two years ago, even, this project would not have happened, just because the technology
then wouldn't have supported it. But now with advanced computing and how developed our
Internet is, it's really the golden era for innovation. And so the question I ask all of
you today is: why wait? Together, we can build the future today. Thanks.
