title: How do contraceptives work?
speaker: NWHunter
description: >-
 Contraceptives are designed to prevent pregnancy in three basic ways: they either
 block sperm, disable sperm before they reach the uterus, or suppress ovulation.
 But is one strategy better than the other? And how does each one work? NWHunter
 describes the mechanics behind different kinds of contraceptives. [Directed by

Here's what has to happen for pregnancy to occur after sexual intercourse. Sperm must swim
up the vagina, through the cervical opening, upwards through the uterus, and into one of
the two fallopian tubes. If an egg, released during that month's ovulation, is in the
tube, one sperm has a chance to fertilize it. Contraceptives are designed to prevent this
process, and they work in three basic ways. They block the sperm, disable sperm before
they reach the uterus, or suppress ovulation. Block is the simplest. Male and female
condoms prevent sperm from coming into contact with the vaginal space. That barrier is
also why they, unlike other contraceptive methods, are able to prevent transmission of
certain sexually transmitted diseases. Meanwhile, the diaphragm, cervical cap, and sponge
work by being placed over the cervix, barricading the entrance to the uterus. These
contraceptives are sometimes called barrier methods and can be used with spermicides, an
example of the second category, disable.

A spermicide is a chemical that immobilizes and destroys sperm. Today's spermicides come
as foam, cream, jelly, suppositories, and even a thin piece of translucent film that
dissolves in the vagina. These products can be inserted directly into the vagina before
intercourse, or can be combined with block methods, like a diaphragm or condom, for added
proection. The third category for preventing pregnancy works by suppressing the action of
an egg maturing in the ovary. If there isn't an egg available in the fallopian tube,
there's nothing for sperm to fertilize. Hormonal contraceptives, including the pill, the
patch, the Depo shot, and the vaginal ring all release synthetic versions of various
combinations of progesterone and estrogen. This hormone cocktail suppresses ovulation,
keeping the immature egg safely sequestered in the ovary. Synthetic progesterone also has
a block trick up its sleeve. It makes cervical mucus too thick and sticky for sperm to
swim through easily.

There are other contraceptives that use multiple approaches at the same time. For example,
many IUDs, or intrauterine devices, contain synthetic hormones which suppress ovulation.
Some also contain copper, which disable sperm while also making egg implantation in the
uterus difficult. Block, disable, or suppress: is one strategy better than the other?
There are differences, but a lot of it has to do with how convenient and easy it is to use
 each contraceptive correctly. For example, male condoms would be about 98% effective if
everyone used them perfectly. That 98% means if 100 couples correctly used condoms for a
year, two women would get pregnant. But not everyone uses them correctly, so they're only
82% effective in practice. Other methods, like the patch and pill, are 99% effective when
they're used perfectly. But in practice, that's 91%. Spermicide is only 85% effective,
even with perfect usage, and just 71% effective with typical usage.

Another important consideration in the choice of contraceptives are side effects, which
almost exclusively affect women rather than men. Hormonal methods in particular can cause
symptoms like headaches, nausea, and high blood pressure, but they vary from woman to
woman. That's why these methods require a prescription from a doctor. The choice of
contraceptive method is a personal one, and what works best for you now may change later.
Scientists also continue to research new methods, such as a male pill that would prevent
sperm production. In the meantime, there are quite a few options to block sperm, disable
them, or suppress eggs and keep them out of reach.
