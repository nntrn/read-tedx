title: On violin and cello, "Passacaglia"
speaker: Robert Gupta + Joshua Roman
description: >-
 It's a master class in collaboration as violinist Robert Gupta and cellist Joshua
 Roman perform Halvorsen's "Passacaglia" for violin and viola. Roman takes the
 viola part on his Stradivarius cello. It's powerful to watch the two musicians
 connect moment to moment (and recover from a mid-performance hiccup). The two are
 both TED Fellows, and their deep connection powers this sparkling duet.
