title: How do blood transfusions work?
speaker: Bill Schutt

 In 1881, doctor William Halsted rushed to help his sister Minnie, who was
 hemorrhaging after childbirth. He quickly inserted a needle into his arm,
 withdrew his own blood, and transferred it to her. After a few uncertain minutes,
 she began to recover. What made this blood transfusion successful? Bill Schutt
 explains the history of the life-saving procedure. [Directed by Hype CG, narrated

In 1881, doctor William Halsted rushed to help his sister Minnie, who was hemorrhaging
after childbirth. He quickly inserted a needle into his arm, withdrew his own blood, and
transferred it to her. After a few uncertain minutes, she began to recover. Halsted didn’t
know how lucky they’d gotten. His transfusion only worked because he and his sister
happened to have the same blood type— something that isn’t guaranteed, even among close
relatives. Blood types hadn’t been discovered by Halsted’s time, though people had been
experimenting with transfusions for centuries— mostly unsuccessfully. In 1667, a French
physician named Jean-Baptiste Denis became the first to try the technique on a human.
Denis transfused sheep’s blood into Antoine Mauroy, a man likely suffering from
psychosis, in the hopes that it would reduce his symptoms. Afterward, Mauroy was in good
spirits. But after a second transfusion, he developed a fever, severe pain in his lower
back, intense burning in his arm, and he urinated a thick, black liquid. Though nobody
knew it at the time, these were the signs of a dangerous immune response unfolding inside
his body.

This immune response starts  with the production of proteins called antibodies, which
distinguish the body’s own cells from intruders. They do so by recognizing the foreign
proteins, or antigens, embedded in an intruder’s cell membrane. Antibodies latch onto the
antigens, signaling other immune cells to attack and destroy the foreign cells. The
destroyed cells are flushed from the body in urine. In extreme cases, the massive break
down of cells causes clots in the bloodstream that disrupt the flow of blood to vital
organs, overload the kidneys, and cause organ failure. Fortunately, Denis’s patient 
survived the transfusion. But, after other cross-species transfusions proved fatal, the
procedure was outlawed across Europe, falling out of favor for several centuries. It
wasn’t until 1901 that Austrian physician Karl Landsteiner discovered blood types, the
crucial step in the success of human to human blood transfusions.

He noticed that when different types were mixed together, they formed clots. This happens
when antibodies latch on to cells with foreign antigens, causing blood cells to clump
together. But if the donor cells are the same blood type as the recipient’s cells, the
donor cells won’t be flagged for destruction, and won’t form clumps. By 1907, doctors were
mixing together small amounts of blood before transfusing it. If there were no clumps, 
the types were a match. This enabled them to save thousands of lives, laying the
foundation for modern transfusions. Up to this point, all transfusions had occurred in
real time, directly between two individuals. That’s because blood begins to clot almost
immediately after coming into contact with air— a defense mechanism to prevent excessive
blood loss after injury. In 1914, researchers discovered that the chemical sodium citrate
stopped blood coagulating by removing the calcium necessary for clot formation.

Citrated blood could be stored for later use— the first step in making large scale blood
transfusions possible. In 1916, a pair of American scientists found an even more
effective anticoagulant called heparin, which works by deactivating enzymes that enable
clotting. We still use heparin today. At the same time, American and British researchers 
developed portable machines that could transport donor blood onto the battlefields of
World War I. Combined with the newly-discovered heparin, medics safely stored and
preserved liters of blood, wheeling it directly onto the battlefield to transfuse wounded
soldiers. After the war, this crude portable box would become the inspiration for the
modern-day blood bank, a fixture of hospitals around the world.
