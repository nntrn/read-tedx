Mysteries of vernacular: Robot, a machine capable of carrying out a programmable series of
actions. The origin of the word robot dates back more than a thousand years to the era of
serfdom in central Europe when servitude was the currency for rent. In those days, the Old
Church Slavonic word rabota described the forced labor of the people. A slight adjustment
of spelling, and rabota became the Czech robota, which, in addition to defining the toil
of the serfs, was also used figuratively to describe any kind of hard work or drudgery. In
1920, Czech writer Karel Capek published a science fiction play called "R.U.R.", short for
"Rossum's Universal Robots." The story featured automated machines with distinctly human
features that, until they revolt, catered to the whims of the people of Earth. Capek
originally considered calling these hard-working machines labori from the Latin word for
labor, but he worried it sounded a bit too scholarly.

He opted, instead, to emphasize their enslaved state by naming them roboti, or robot in
English. "R.U.R." was wildly successful, and when it was translated into English in 1923,
the word robot was enthusiastically embraced. Though most of today's robots look quite
different than Capek imagined, they've become just as popular as he predicted. Unlike in
"R.U.R.", though, our robots haven't risen up against us, and here's hoping it stays that
way!
