♫ Here we stand ♫♫ Like an Adam and an Eve ♫♫ Waterfalls ♫♫ The Garden of Eden ♫♫ Two
fools in love ♫♫ So beautiful and strong ♫♫ Birds in the trees ♫♫ Are smiling upon them ♫♫
From the age of the dinosaurs ♫♫ Cars would run on gasoline ♫♫ Where? Where have they
gone? ♫♫ Now, there's nothing but flowers ♫♫ This was a factory ♫♫Now there are
mountains and rivers ♫♫ You got it, you got it ♫♫ We caught a rattlesnake ♫♫ Now we've
got something for dinner ♫♫ You got it, you got it ♫♫ This was a parking lot ♫♫ Now it's
all covered with flowers ♫♫ You got it, you got it ♫♫ If this is paradise ♫♫ I wish I had
a lawnmower ♫♫ You got it, you got it ♫♫ This was a shopping mall ♫♫ Now it's turned into
corn field ♫♫ You got it, you got it ♫♫ Don't leave me stranded here ♫♫ I can't get used
to this lifestyle ♫

Thomas Dolby: David Byrne.
