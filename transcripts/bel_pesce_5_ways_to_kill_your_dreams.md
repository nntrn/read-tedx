I dedicated the past two years to understanding how people achieve their dreams. When we
think about the dreams we have, and the dent we want to leave in the universe, it is
striking to see how big of an overlap there is between the dreams that we have, and
projects that never happen.

So I'm here to talk to you today about five ways how not to follow your dreams. One:
Believe in overnight success. You know the story, right? The tech guy built a mobile app
and sold it very fast for a lot of money. You know, the story may seem real, but I bet
it's incomplete. If you go investigate further, the guy has done 30 apps before and he has
done a master's on the topic, a PhD. He has been working on the topic for 20 years. This is
really interesting. I myself have a story in Brazil that people think is an overnight
success. I come from a humble family, and two weeks before the deadline to apply for MIT,
I started the application process. And, voilà! I got in. People may think it's an
overnight success, but that only worked because for the 17 years prior to that, I took
life and education seriously. Your overnight success story is always a result of
everything you've done in your life through that moment. Two: Believe someone else has the
answers for you.

Constantly, people want to help out, right? All sorts of people: your family, your
friends, your business partners, they all have opinions on which path you should take:
"And let me tell you, go through this pipe." But whenever you go inside, there are other
ways you have to pick as well. And you need to make those decisions yourself. No one else
has the perfect answers for your life. And you need to keep picking those decisions,
right? The pipes are infinite and you're going to bump your head, and it's a part of the
process. Three, and it's very subtle but very important: Decide to settle when growth is
guaranteed. So when your life is going great, you have put together a great team, and you
have growing revenue, and everything is set — time to settle. When I launched my first
book, I worked really, really hard to distribute it everywhere in Brazil. With that, over
three million people downloaded it, over 50,000 people bought physical
copies.

When I wrote a sequel, some impact was guaranteed. Even if I did little, sales would be
OK. But OK is never OK. When you're growing towards a peak, you need to work harder than
ever and find yourself another peak. Maybe if I did little, a couple hundred thousand
people would read it, and that's great already. But if I work harder than ever, I can
bring this number up to millions. That's why I decided, with my new book, to go to every
single state of Brazil. And I can already see a higher peak. There's no time to settle
down. Fourth tip, and that's really important: Believe the fault is someone else's. I
constantly see people saying, "Yes, I had this great idea, but no investor had the vision
to invest." "Oh, I created this great product, but the market is so bad, the sales didn't
go well." Or, "I can't find good talent; my team is so below expectations." If you have
dreams, it's your responsibility to make them happen. Yes, it may be hard to find talent.
Yes, the market may be bad.

But if no one invested in your idea, if no one bought your product, for sure, there is
something there that is your fault.

Definitely. You need to get your dreams and make them happen. And no one achieved their
goals alone. But if you didn't make them happen, it's your fault and no one else's. Be
responsible for your dreams. And one last tip, and this one is really important as well:
Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves. Once I saw an ad, and
it was a lot of friends, they were going up a mountain, it was a very high mountain, and
it was a lot of work. You could see that they were sweating and this was tough. And they
were going up, and they finally made it to the peak. Of course, they decided to celebrate,
right? I'm going to celebrate, so, "Yes! We made it, we're at the top!" Two seconds later,
one looks at the other and says, "OK, let's go down."

Life is never about the goals themselves. Life is about the journey. Yes, you should enjoy
the goals themselves, but people think that you have dreams, and whenever you get to
reaching one of those dreams, it's a magical place where happiness will be all around. But
achieving a dream is a momentary sensation, and your life is not. The only way to really
achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey. That's the best
way. And your journey is simple — it's made of steps. Some steps will be right on.
Sometimes you will trip. If it's right on, celebrate, because some people wait a lot to
celebrate. And if you tripped, turn that into something to learn. If every step becomes
something to learn or something to celebrate, you will for sure enjoy the journey. So, five
tips: Believe in overnight success, believe someone else has the answers for you, believe
that when growth is guaranteed, you should settle down, believe the fault is someone
else's, and believe that only the goals themselves matter.

Believe me, you do that, and you will destroy your dreams.

Thank you. Thanks.
