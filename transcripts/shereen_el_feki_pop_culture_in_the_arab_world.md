title: Pop culture in the Arab world
speaker: Shereen El Feki
description: >-
 Shereen El Feki shows how some Arab cultures are borrowing trademarks of Western
 pop culture -- music videos, comics, even Barbie -- and adding a culturally
 appropriate twist. The hybridized media shows how two civilizations, rather than
 dividing, can dovetail.

Hello, everyone. Because this is my first time at TED, I've decided to bring along an old
friend to help break the ice a bit. Yes. That's right. This is Barbie. She's 50 years old.
And she's looking as young as ever. 

But I'd also like to introduce you to what may be an unfamiliar face. This is Fulla. Fulla
is the Arab world's answer to Barbie. Now, according to proponents of the clash of
civilizations, Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres. They have
different interests. They have divergent values. And should they ever come in contact ...
well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty. My experience, however, in
the Islamic world is very different. Where I work, in the Arab region, people are busy
taking up Western innovations and changing them into things which are neither
conventionally Western, nor are they traditionally Islamic. I want to show you two
examples. The first is 4Shbab. It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV
channel.

: Video clips from across the globe. The USA.♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫♫ I am not
afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side ♫♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫♫
Everything will be all right ♫♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫The Arab
world.

♫ She was preserved by modesty of the religion ♫ ♫ She was adorned by the light of the
Quran ♫Shereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV. Its creator, who is an
Egyptian TV producer called Ahmed Abu Haïba, wants young people to be inspired by Islam to
lead better lives. He reckons the best way to get that message across is to use the
enormously popular medium of music videos. 4Shbab was set up as an alternative to existing
Arab music channels. And they look something like this. 

That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star and pan-Arab pin-up girl. In
the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind. But it's not about fire and brimstone
either. Its videos are intended to show a kinder, gentler face of Islam, for young people
to deal with life's challenges. Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd. And
it's called "The 99." Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes. They were
created by a Kuwaiti psychologist called Naif Al Mutawa. And his desire is to rescue Islam
from images of intolerance, all in a child-friendly format. "The 99." The characters are
meant to embody the 99 attributes of Allah: justice, wisdom, mercy, among others. So, for
example, there is the character of Noora. She is meant to have the power to look inside
people and see the good and bad in everyone. Another character called Jami has the ability
to create fantastic inventions. Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book. It's now a theme
park.

There is an animated series in the works. And by this time next year, the likes of
Superman and Wonder Woman will have joined forces with "The 99" to beat injustice wherever
they find it."The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples of this sort of Islamic
cross-cultural hybridization. We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations. Nor
is it some sort of indistinguishable mash. I like to think of it as a mesh of
civilizations, in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined. Now, while
4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny, there is actually a very long tradition of
this. Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations both
ancient and modern. After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this: "We made you
into nations and tribes so that you could learn from one another." And to my mind, those
are pretty wise words, no matter what your creed. Thank you.
