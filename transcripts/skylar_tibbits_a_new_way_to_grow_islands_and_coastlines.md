title: A new way to "grow" islands and coastlines
speaker: Skylar Tibbits
description: >-
 What if we could harness the ocean's movement to protect coastal communities from
 rising sea levels? Designer and TED Fellow Skylar Tibbits shows how his lab is
 creating a dynamic, adaptable system of underwater structures that uses energy
 from ocean waves to accumulate sand and restore eroding shorelines -- working
 with the forces of nature to build rather than destroy.

For nearly a decade, my collaborators and I at the Self-Assembly Lab have been working on
material systems that transform themselves, assemble themselves and adapt to their
environment. From our early work on 4D printing, where we printed objects, dipped them
underwater, and they transform, to our active auxetics that respond to temperature and
sunlight, to our more recent work on active textiles that respond to body temperature and
change porosity, to our rapid liquid printing work where we print inflatable structures
that morph based on air pressure and go from one shape to another, or our self-assembly
work where we dip objects underwater, they respond to wave energy and assemble themselves
into precise objects like furniture. Or, at larger scales, using wind energy, we have
meter-diameter weather balloons that assemble in the airspace above a construction site.
For dangerous environments or harsh, extreme places where it's hard to get people or
equipment, they can assemble in the airspace, and as the helium dies, they then come back
to the ground, and you're left with a big space frame structure. All of this research is
about taking simple materials, activating them with forces in their environment — gravity,
wind, waves, temperature, sunlight — and getting them to perform, getting them to
transform, assemble, etc.

How do we build smart things without complex electromechanical devices? But more recently
we were approached by a group in the Maldives, and they were interested in taking some of
this research and ways of thinking and applying it to some of the challenges that they've
faced in terms of climate change. And the first thing you do when you're approached by
someone in the Maldives is say you want to go on a site visit.

It is amazing. So we went there and I actually walked away with a really different
perspective on the future of climate change. Because you would imagine, you know, the
Maldives are sinking. They're screwed. What are they going to do? But I walked away
thinking, they might be the model, the future model of the built environment, where they
can adapt and be resilient rather than our fixed, man-made infrastructure. But there's
typically three main approaches to sea level rise and climate change. One of them is that
we can do nothing and we can run away. And that's a pretty bad idea. As more than 40
percent of the world's population is living in coastal areas, as sea levels rise and as
storms get worse and worse, we're going to be more and more underwater. So it's imperative
that we solve this pretty demanding problem. The second is that we can build barriers. We
can build walls. The problem here is that we take a static solution trying to fight
against a superdynamic, high-energy problem, and nature is almost always going to
win.

So that's likely not going to work either. The third approach is using dredging. So
dredging is where you suck up a bunch of sand from the deep ocean and you pump it back
onto the beaches. If you go to any beach around the Northeast or Western Coast, you'll see
that they use dredging year after year after year just to survive. It's really not a good
solution. In the Maldives, they do the same thing, and they can build an island in a month,
a brand new island they build from dredging. But it's really, really bad for the marine
ecosystem, and then they become addicted to dredging. They need to do that year after
year. But in the time that it took them to build that one island, three sandbars built
themselves, and these are massive amounts of sand so big you can park your boat on it, and
this is what's called a site visit. It's really hard work.

In Boston winters. This is massive amounts of sand that naturally accumulates just based
on the forces of the waves and the ocean topography. So we started to study that. Why do
sandbars form? If we could tap into that, we could understand it and we could utilize it.
It's based on the amount of energy in the ocean and the topography in the landscape that
promotes sand accumulation. So what we're proposing is to work with the forces of nature
to build rather than destroy, and in my lab at MIT, we set up a wave tank, a big tank
that's pumping waves, and we placed geometries underwater. We tried all sorts of different
geometries. The waves interact with the geometry, and then create turbulence and start to
accumulate the sand so the sand starts to form these sandbars on their own. Here's an
aerial view. On the left-hand side, you'll see the beach that's growing. In the middle
you'll see the sandbar that formed.

So these are geometries that collaborate with the force of the wave to build. We then
started to fabricate one. This was in February in Boston. We have large rolls of canvas.
It's a biodegradable material, it's super cheap, easy to work with. We then sew it into
these large bladders, and then we flew over there. And I know what you're thinking. This
is not the Fyre Festival.

This is real life. It's real. And we flew there with these canvas bladders in our
suitcases, we got sunburned because it was Boston winter, and then we filled them with
sand and we placed them underwater. These are exactly the same geometries that you saw in
the tank, they're just human scale. Large objects filled with sand, we'd place them
underwater, they're just really simple geometries. In the front of them, you'll see it's
clear water. The waves are crashing over. It's quite clear. And then on the backside,
there's turbulence. The water and the sand is mixing up. It's causing sediment transport,
and then the sand is accumulating. You'll see some friendly stingrays here that visited
us. On the left is day one, the right is day three. You'll see the sand ripples in the
light areas where the sand is accumulating just after two days. So this was last February,
and it's very much ongoing work. This is just in the beginning of this
research.

Over the next year and longer, we're going to be studying this through satellite imagery
and bathymetry data to understand what the short-term and long-term impacts are of natural
sand accumulation in the environment. And the bigger vision, though, is that we want to
build submersible geometries, almost like submarines that we can sink and float. Like
adaptable artificial reefs, you could deploy them if there's a storm coming from one
direction or another or if the seasons are changing, you can use these adaptable reef
structures to use the force of the waves to accumulate sand. And we think this could be
used in many coastal regions and many island nations around the world. But when we think
about building smarter environments, think of smarter buildings or smarter cars or smarter
clothing, that typically means adding more power, more batteries, more devices, more cost,
more complexity and ultimately more failure.

So we're always trying to think about how do we build smarter things with less? How do we
build smarter things that are simple? And so what we're proposing at the lab and with this
project specifically is to use simple materials like sand that collaborates with forces in
the environment like waves to accumulate and adapt. And we'd like to work with you,
collaborate with us, to develop this, to scale it and apply this way of thinking. We think
it's a different model for climate change, one that's about adaptation and resilience
rather than resistance and fear. So help us turn natural destruction into natural
construction. Thank you.
