title: The fascinating secret lives of giant clams
speaker: Mei Lin Neo
description: >-
 When you think about the deep blue sea, you might instantly think of whales or
 coral reefs. But spare a thought for giant clams, the world's largest living
 shellfish. These incredible creatures can live to 100, grow up to four and a half
 feet long and weigh as much as three baby elephants. In this charming talk,
 marine biologist Mei Lin Neo shares why she's obsessively trying to turn these
 legendary sea creatures into heroes of the oceans.

Back home, my friends call me nicknames, such as "The Giant Clam Girl," "Clam Queen," or,
"The Mother of Clams."

This is because every time I see them, I talk nonstop about giant clams all day, every
day. Giant clams are these massive and colorful shelled marine animals, the largest of its
kind. Just look at this shell. The biggest recorded individual was four-and-a-half-feet
long and weighed about 550 pounds. That is almost as heavy as three baby elephants. South
Pacific legends once described giant clams as man-eaters that would lie in wait on the
seabed to trap unsuspecting divers. A story goes that a diver had lost his legs while
trying to retrieve a pearl from a giant clam. I thought, "Really?" So out of curiosity, I
did an experiment using myself as bait.

I carefully placed my hand into the clam's mouth and waited. Hmm ... I still have my hand.
It seems that these gentle giants would rather retreat and protect their fleshy bodies
than feed on me. So much for those killer clam myths!Unfortunately, the reality is, we are
the giant clams' biggest threat. Considered a delicacy throughout the Western Pacific and
Indian Oceans, giant clams have been traditionally fished as seafood. Fishermen are
particularly interested in their adductor muscles, which are organs that hold the two
shells together like a hinge. Just for their muscles, giant clams were almost hunted to
extinction between the 1960s and 1980s. Clamshells are also popular in the ornamental
trade as jewelry and for display. In the South China Sea, fishermen went out of their way
to collect fossilized clamshells by digging through large areas of coral reefs. These were
later carved and sold as so-called "ivory handicrafts" in China. Giant clams, dead or
alive, are not safe from us.

It's a "clamity!"

With the spotlight on more charismatic marine animals such as the whales and coral reefs,
it is easy to forget that other marine life needs our help, too. My fascination with giant
clams got me started on conservation research to fill in the knowledge gaps on their
ecology and behavior. One of the discoveries that we made was that giant clams could walk
across the seafloor. Yes, you heard me right: they can walk. To find out, we placed
numerous baby clams on a grid. Now watch what happens over 24 hours. We think that walking
is important for getting away from predators and finding mates for breeding. While it can
hard to imagine any movement in these enormous animals, giant clams up to 400 pounds can
still walk, they just move slower. During my PhD, I discovered more secrets about the giant
clams. But there was something missing in my work. I found myself asking, "Why should
people care about conserving giant clams?" â€” other than myself, of course.

It turns out that giant clams have a giant impact on coral reefs. These multitasking clams
are reef builders, food factories, shelters for shrimps and crabs and water filters, all
rolled into one. In a nutshell, giant clams play a major contributing role as residents of
their own reef home, and just having them around keeps the reef healthy. And because they
can live up to 100 years old, giant clams make vital indicators of coral reef health. So
when giant clams start to disappear from coral reefs, their absence can serve as an alarm
bell for scientists to start paying attention, similar to the canary in a coal mine. But
giant clams are endangered. The largest clam in the world is facing the threat of
extinction, with more than 50 percent of the wild population severely depleted. And the
ecological benefits of having giant clams on coral reefs are likely to continue only if
populations are healthy, making their conservation paramount. So I stand here today to give
a voice to the giant clams, because I care a whole lot for these amazing animals, and they
deserve to be cared for.

It is time for the giant clams to step out of their shells, and show the world that they,
too, can be the heroes of the oceans. Thank you very much.
