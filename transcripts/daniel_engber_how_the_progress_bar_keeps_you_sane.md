How many people are bored at their desk for how many hours every day and how many days a
week and how many weeks a year for how many years in their life?[Small thing. Big
idea.][Daniel Engber on the Progress Bar]The progress bar is just an indicator on a
computer that something's happening inside the device. The classic one that's been used
for years is a horizontal bar. I mean, this goes back to pre-computer versions of this on
ledgers, where people would fill in a horizontal bar from left to right to show how much
of a task they had completed at a factory. This is just the same thing on a
screen. Something happened in the 70s that is sometimes referred to as "the software
crisis," where suddenly, computers were getting more complicated more quickly than anyone
had been prepared for, from a design perspective. People were using percent-done
indicators in different ways. So you might have a graphical countdown clock, or they would
have a line of asterisks that would fill out from left to right on a screen.

But no one had done a systematic survey of these things and tried to figure out: How do
they actually affect the user's experience of sitting at the computer? This graduate
student named Brad Myers, in 1985, decided he would study this. He found that it didn't
really matter if the percent-done indicator was giving you the accurate percent done. What
mattered was that it was there at all. Just seeing it there made people feel better, and
that was the most surprising thing. He has all these ideas about what this thing could do.
Maybe it could make people relax effectively. Maybe it would allow people to turn away
from their machine and do something else of exactly the right duration. They would look
and say, "Oh, the progress bar is half done. That took five minutes. So now I have five
minutes to send this fax," or whatever people were doing in 1985. Both of those things are
wrong. Like, when you see that progress bar, it sort of locks your attention in a tractor
beam, and it turns the experience of waiting into this exciting narrative that you're
seeing unfold in front of you: that somehow, this time you've spent waiting in frustration
for the computer to do something, has been reconceptualized as: "Progress! Oh! Great stuff
is happening!"[Progress...]But once you start thinking about the progress bar as something
that's more about dulling the pain of waiting, well, then you can start fiddling around
with the psychology. So if you have a progress bar that just moves at a constant rate —
let's say, that's really what's happening in the computer — that will feel to people like
it's slowing down.

We get bored. Well, now you can start trying to enhance it and make it appear to move more
quickly than it really is, make it move faster at the beginning, like a burst of speed.
That's exciting, people feel like, "Oh! Something's really happening!" Then you can move
back into a more naturalistic growth of the progress bar as you go along. You're assuming
that people are focusing on the passage of time — they're trying to watch grass grow,
they're trying to watch a pot of water, waiting for it to boil, and you're just trying to
make that less boring, less painful and less frustrating than it was before. So the
progress bar at least gives you the vision of a beginning and an end, and you're working
towards a goal. I think in some ways, it mitigates the fear of death. Too
much?
