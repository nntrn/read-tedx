title: Who were the Vestal Virgins, and what was their job?
speaker: Peta Greenfield
description: >-
 In ancient Rome, Vestal Virgins were tasked with keeping vigil over the flame of
 Vesta, the virgin goddess of the hearth. The flame represented two things: the
 continuation of Rome as a power in the world and the continuing virginity of
 Vesta's priestesses. But what was life really like for these Vestal Virgins? Peta
 Greenfield goes back in time to find out. [Directed by Kozmonot Animation Studio,
 narrated by Susan Zimmerman, music by Wonder Boy Audio].

A lone priestess walks towards an underground chamber. People line the streets to watch as
she proclaims her innocence. It doesn't matter. She's already been judged and found
guilty. The sentence? Live burial. The underground chamber contains a portion of bread,
water, milk, and oil. She will have a lamp, a bed, and a blanket, but she won't emerge
alive. At the threshold, the priestess pauses, claims her innocence one last time, then
enters the chamber never to be seen again by the Roman people. The priestess is one of
Rome's six Vestal Virgins, each carefully selected as children from Rome's most
aristocratic families. But now with her death, there are only five, and a new priestess
must be chosen. The six-year-old Licinia witnessed the spectacle, never suspecting that a
few days later, she'd be chosen as the next Vestal Virgin. Her age, her patrician family
lineage, and her apparent good health makes her the best candidate to serve the goddess
Vesta in the eyes of the Romans.

Her parents are proud that their daughter's been chosen. Licinia is afraid, but she has no
choice in the matter. She must serve the goddess for at least the next 30 years. For the
first ten years of Licinia's service, she's considered in training, learning how to be a
Vestal Virgin. Her most important duty is keeping vigil over the flame of Vesta, the
virgin goddess of the hearth. Vesta doesn't have a statue like other Roman gods and
goddesses. Instead, she's represented by the flame which burns day and night in her temple
located next to the Forum in the center of the city. Like all Vestal priestesses, Licinia
spends part of each day on shift, watching and tending to the flame. The flame represents
two things. The first is the continuation of Rome as a power in the world. The Romans
believed that if the flame goes out, the city's in danger. The flame also symbolizes the
continuing virginity of Vesta's priestesses.

For the Romans, a Vestal's virginity signaled not only her castitas, or modest spirit and
body, but also her ritual purity. So Licinia knows she must never let the flame go out.
Her life, the lives of her fellow Vestals, and the safety of Rome itself depends upon it.
Licinia learns to collect water each day from a nearby fountain to cleanse the temple. She
learns the Fasti, the calendar of sacred rituals and she watches while the senior
priestesses conduct sacrifices. By the time Licinia completes her training, she's 16
years old. Licinia understands that the way she must act is a reflection of the goddess
she serves. When it's her turn to collect the water, she keeps her eyes lowered to the
ground. When she performs sacrifices, she focuses intently on the task. Licinia directs
her energy towards being the best priestess she can be. She's worried that someday the
state will claim her life for its own purposes to protect itself from danger.

Licinia could be accused of incestum, meaning unchastity, at any time and be sacrificed
whether she's innocent or guilty. Licinia fully understands now why her predecessor was
buried alive. Ten years ago, the flame of Vesta went out. The priestesses knew that they
couldn't keep it a secret. The future of Rome depended upon it. They went to the chief
priest and he opened an investigation to discover why the flame had failed. Someone came
forward and claimed that one of the Vestals was no longer a virgin. That was the beginning
of the end. The accused protested her innocence, but it wasn't enough. She was tried and
found guilty. That Vestal's death was meant to protect the city, but Licinia weeps for
what has been lost and for what she knows now. Her own path was paved by the death of
another, and her life could be taken just as easily for something as simple as a flame
going out.
