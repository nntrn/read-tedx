♫ Like the heather ♫♫ on the hillside ♫♫ as they drove us ♫♫ from the Highlands ♫♫ Like
the ice flow ♫♫ from the Arctic ♫♫ where we landed ♫♫ in Newfoundland ♫♫ There's a color
♫♫ to my sorrow ♫♫ There's a name for ♫♫ all this sadness ♫♫ Like the ocean ♫♫ in between
us ♫♫ I am blue ♫♫ Blue is a river ♫♫ Blue remembered ♫♫ Blue water ♫♫ running clear ♫♫
Blue like a planet ♫♫ to a spaceman ♫♫ Blue river ♫♫ of my tears ♫(Fiddle and
synthesizer)♫ So I came here ♫♫ to the city ♫♫ where the dream burns ♫♫ like a furnace ♫♫
And I dazzled ♫♫ in these dark streets ♫♫ like a diamond ♫♫ in a coalface ♫♫ Then the cold
wind ♫♫ from the islands ♫♫ blew a storm cloud ♫♫ across the new moon ♫♫ Like the gun
smoke ♫♫ above the houses ♫♫ in my home ♫♫ Blue is a river ♫♫ Blue remembered ♫♫ Blue
water ♫♫ running clear ♫♫ Blue like a planet ♫♫ to a spaceman ♫♫ Blue river ♫♫ of my tears
♫♫ Blue river ♫♫ of my tears ♫(Fiddle and synthesizer)
