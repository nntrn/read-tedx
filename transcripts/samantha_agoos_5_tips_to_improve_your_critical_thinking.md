Every day, a sea of decisions stretches before us. Some are small and unimportant, but
others have a larger impact on our lives. For example, which politician should I vote
for? Should I try the latest diet craze? Or will email make me a millionaire? We're
bombarded with so many decisions that it's impossible to make a perfect choice every
time. But there are many ways to improve our chances, and one particularly effective
technique is critical thinking. This is a way of approaching a question that allows us to
carefully deconstruct a situation, reveal its hidden issues, such as bias and
manipulation, and make the best decision. If the critical part sounds negative that's
because in a way it is. Rather than choosing an answer because it feels right, a person
who uses critical thinking subjects all available options to scrutiny and skepticism.
Using the tools at their disposal, they'll eliminate everything but the most useful and
reliable information.

There are many different ways of approaching critical thinking, but here's one five-step
process that may help you solve any number of problems. One: formulate your question. In
other words, know what you're looking for. This isn't always as straightforward as it
sounds. For example, if you're deciding whether to try out the newest diet craze, your
reasons for doing so may be obscured by other factors, like claims that you'll see results
in just two weeks. But if you approach the situation with a clear view of what you're 
actually trying to accomplish by dieting, whether that's weight loss, better nutrition, or
having more energy, that'll equip you to sift through this information critically, find
what you're looking for, and decide whether the new fad really suits your needs. Two:
gather your information. There's lots of it out there, so having a clear idea of your
question will help you determine what's relevant.

If you're trying to decide on a diet to improve your nutrition, you may ask an expert for
their advice, or seek other people's testimonies. Information gathering helps you weigh
different options, moving you closer to a decision that meets your goal. Three: apply the
information, something you do by asking critical questions. Facing a decision, ask
yourself, "What concepts are at work?" "What assumptions exist?" "Is my interpretation of
the information logically sound?" For example, in an email that promises you millions, you
should consider, "What is shaping my approach to this situation?" "Do I assume the sender 
is telling the truth?" "Based on the evidence, is it logical to assume I'll win any
money?" Four: consider the implications. Imagine it's election time, and you've selected a
political candidate based on their promise to make it cheaper for drivers to fill up on
gas. At first glance, that seems great. But what about the long-term environmental
effects?

If gasoline use is less restricted by cost, this could also cause a huge surge in air
pollution, an unintended consequence that's important to think about. Five: explore other
points of view. Ask yourself why so many people are drawn to the policies of the opposing
political candidate. Even if you disagree with everything that candidate says, exploring
the full spectrum of viewpoints might explain why some policies that don't seem valid to
you appeal to others. This will allow you to explore alternatives, evaluate your own
choices, and ultimately help you make more informed decisions. This five-step process is
just one tool, and it certainly won't eradicate difficult decisions from our lives. But it
can help us increase the number of positive choices we make. Critical thinking can give
us the tools to sift through a sea of information and find what we're looking for. And if
enough of us use it, it has the power to make the world a more reasonable
place.
