Back in New York, I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood. When
I'm not fighting poverty, I'm fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire
company. Now in our town, where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff,
you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action. I remember my first
fire. I was the second volunteer on the scene, so there was a pretty good chance I was
going to get in. But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to
the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be. When I found the captain,
he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner, who was surely having one
of the worst days of her life. Here it was, the middle of the night, she was standing
outside in the pouring rain, under an umbrella, in her pajamas, barefoot, while her house
was in flames. The other volunteer who had arrived just before me — let's call him Lex
Luther — 

got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner's dog. The dog!
I was stunned with jealousy. Here was some lawyer or money manager who, for the rest of
his life, gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living
creature, just because he beat me by five seconds. Well, I was next. The captain waved me
over. He said, "Bezos, I need you to go into the house. I need you to go upstairs, past
the fire, and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes." 

I swear. So, not exactly what I was hoping for, but off I went — up the stairs, down the
hall, past the 'real' firefighters, who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this
point, into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes. Now I know what you're thinking, but
I'm no hero. 

I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the
front door. We took our treasures outside to the homeowner, where, not surprisingly, his
received much more attention than did mine. A few weeks later, the department received a
letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home.
The act of kindness she noted above all others: someone had even gotten her a pair of
shoes.

In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter, I am
witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale, but I'm also witness to
acts of grace and courage on an individual basis. And you know what I've learned? They all
matter. So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved, or are on their
way to achieving, remarkable levels of success, I would offer this reminder: don't wait.
Don't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody's life. If
you have something to give, give it now. Serve food at a soup kitchen. Clean up a
neighborhood park. Be a mentor. Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save
somebody's life, but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one. So get in the game.
Save the shoes. Thank you.

Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, come back.

Mark Bezos: Thank you.
