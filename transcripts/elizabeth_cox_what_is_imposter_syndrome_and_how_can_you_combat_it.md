Even after writing eleven books and winning several prestigious awards, Maya Angelou
couldn’t escape the nagging doubt that she hadn’t really earned her accomplishments.
Albert Einstein experienced something similar: he described himself as an “involuntary
swindler” whose work didn’t deserve as much attention as it had received. Accomplishments
at the level of Angelou’s or Einstein’s are rare, but their feeling of fraudulence is
extremely common. Why can’t so many of us shake feelings that we haven’t earned our
accomplishments, or that our ideas and skills aren’t worthy of others’
attention? Psychologist Pauline Rose Clance was the first to study this unwarranted sense
of insecurity. In her work as a therapist, she noticed many of her undergraduate patients
shared a concern: though they had high grades, they didn’t believe they deserved their
spots at the university. Some even believed their acceptance had been an admissions
error.

While Clance knew these fears were unfounded, she could also remember feeling the exact
same way in graduate school. She and her patients experienced something that goes by a
number of names— imposter phenomenon, imposter experience, and imposter syndrome. Together
with colleague Suzanne Imes, Clance first studied imposterism in female college students
and faculty. Their work established pervasive feelings of fraudulence in this group. Since
that first study, the same thing has been established across gender, race, age, and a
huge range of occupations, though it may be more prevalent and disproportionately affect
the experiences of underrepresented or disadvantaged groups. To call it a syndrome is to
downplay how universal it is. It's not a disease or an abnormality, and it isn’t
necessarily tied to depression, anxiety, or self-esteem. Where do these feelings of
fraudulence come from? People who are highly skilled or accomplished tend to think others
are just as skilled.

This can spiral into feelings that they don’t deserve accolades and opportunities over
other people. And as Angelou and Einstein experienced, there’s often no threshold of
accomplishment that puts these feelings to rest. Feelings of imposterism aren’t restricted
 to highly skilled individuals, either. Everyone is susceptible to a phenomenon known as
pluralistic ignorance, where we each doubt ourselves privately, but believe we’re alone 
in thinking that way because no one else voices their doubts. Since it’s tough to really
know how hard our peers work, how difficult they find certain tasks, or how much they
doubt themselves, there’s no easy way to dismiss feelings that we’re less capable than
the people around us. Intense feelings of imposterism can prevent people from sharing
their great ideas or applying for jobs and programs where they’d excel. At least so far,
the most surefire way to combat imposter syndrome is to talk about it.

Many people suffering from imposter syndrome are afraid that if they ask about their
performance, their fears will be confirmed. And even when they receive positive feedback,
it often fails to ease feelings of fraudulence. But on the other hand, hearing that an
advisor or mentor has experienced feelings of imposterism can help relieve those feelings.
The same goes for peers. Even simply finding out there’s a term for these feelings can be
an incredible relief. Once you’re aware of the phenomenon, you can combat your own
imposter syndrome by collecting and revisiting positive feedback. One scientist who
kept blaming herself for problems in her lab started to document the causes every time
something went wrong. Eventually, she realized most of the problems came from equipment
failure, and came to recognize her own competence. We may never be able to banish these
feelings entirely, but we can have open conversations about academic or professional
challenges.

With increasing awareness of how common these experiences are, perhaps we can feel freer
to be frank about our feelings and build confidence in some simple truths: you have
talent, you are capable, and you belong.
