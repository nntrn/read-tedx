Trees epitomize stasis. Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human
generations, but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs, trees become
very dynamic entities, moving and growing. And I decided to explore this movement by
turning trees into artists. I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig. I waited
for the wind to come up and held up a canvas, and that produced art. The piece of art you
see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas
fir, and what I learned was that different species have different signatures, like a
Picasso versus a Monet. But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art
might let me capture that and quantify it, so to measure the distance that a single vine
maple tree — which produced this painting — moved in a single year, I simply measured and
summed each of those lines.

I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree
and then divided that by the number of minutes per year. And so I was able to calculate
how far a single tree moved in a single year. You might have a guess. The answer is
actually 186,540 miles, or seven times around the globe. And so simply by shifting our
perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs, we are able to see that trees
are not simply static entities, but rather extremely dynamic. And I began to think about
ways that we might consider this lesson of trees, to consider other entities that are also
static and stuck, but which cry for change and dynamicism, and one of those entities is
our prisons. Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws are stuck, confined
behind bars. And our prison system itself is stuck. The United States has over 2.3 million
incarcerated men and women. That number is rising.

Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released, 60 will return to prison. Funds for
education, for training and for rehabilitation are declining, so this despairing cycle of
incarceration continues. I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as
artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons, and I think the
answer is yes. In the year 2007, I started a partnership with the Washington State
Department of Corrections. Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and
scientists, sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons. We give
science lectures, and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of
watching television or weightlifting. That, I think, is movement. We partnered with the
Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered
prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state. That, I think,
is movement.

We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered
frogs — the Oregon spotted frog — for later release into protected wetlands. That, I
think, is movement. And just recently, we've begun to work with those men who are
segregated in what we call Supermax facilities. They've incurred violent infractions by
becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners. They're kept in bare cells like
this for 23 hours a day. When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health
professionals, they're placed in immobile booths like this. For one hour a day they're
brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards. Although we can't bring trees and prairie
plants and frogs into these environments, we are bringing images of nature into these
exercise yards, putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact with visual images
of nature. This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months, and he's
providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow
inmates more serene, more calm, less apt to violence. And so what we see, I think, is that
small, collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison
system in a direction of hope.

We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks. But if trees can
create art, if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year, if prisoners can grow
plants and raise frogs, then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside
ourselves, like grief, like addictions, like racism, that can also change. Thank you very
much.
