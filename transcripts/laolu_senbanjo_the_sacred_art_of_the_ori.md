title: The Sacred Art of the Ori
speaker: Laolu Senbanjo
description: >-
 Every artist has a name, and every artist has a story. Laolu Senbanjo's story
 started in Nigeria, where he was surrounded by the culture and mythology of the
 Yoruba, and brought him to law school, to New York and eventually to work on
 Beyoncé's "Lemonade." He shares what he calls "The Sacred Art of the Ori," art
 that uses skin as canvas and connects artist and muse through mind, body and
 soul.

[Yoruba: Freeborn Ijebu-Ode son,] [of true Ogbogbo Clan,] [whose wealth and resources
surpass all that Europe ever had,] [whose altar is filled with gold.]This chant is called
the oríkì. My grandmother used to sing it to me when I was a child in Nigeria. See, an
oríkì is the song of praise of the Yoruba people, and this particularly speaks of
treasures that the West does not have. Mama — that's what I call my grandmother — told me
many stories about Yoruba mythology. You see, the Yorubas are an ethnic group from the
southwestern part of Nigeria, and I was always fascinated by these stories. I was always
intrigued. And Yoruba culture has inspired my art since I was a child. You see, African
art is not just what you buy at Harlem markets in New York. Every artist has a name, and
every artist has a story. This is my story. See, mama had tattoos on her arms and her legs.
As a child, I thought she was born with them, with beautiful black lines and detailed
symbols.

And then she told me that they were actually symbols from the Yoruba mythology. I never
knew how this was going to influence the artist that I am today. You see, as a young
child, I saw art everywhere. I remember the house we lived in in Ilorin, in Stadium Road.
We had marble floors, and you know, I would look at the marble floors, and I would see all
sorts of patterns and designs in it, and I thought everybody could see them. So I would
call my brother, and I would be like, "Ikeolu, come and see this marble design, see this
pattern, see this mask." And he would tell me, "Laolu, I don't see anything." So I would
use ink, and I would trace out what I saw on the floor. And then when my mom noticed, she
got really upset.

But that didn't stop me. I switched from ink to chalk, because I got in trouble a lot with
my teachers and my parents. So I remember my mom said, "Laolu, we are Christians. Why
don't you draw like other people? Why don't you draw landscapes or maybe you draw chairs
or furniture, or maybe even draw Jesus?"You know, I could paint the whole house if I had a
chance, but when I grew up, I knew being an artist was not an option, so I wanted to be
the person my parents wanted me to be, so I went to law school. Of course, that's my dad
there. He was so proud that day. And this was what my notebooks looked like in law
school.

Of course I would miss classes, and I would make up excuses why I wasn't going to
class. But when I started working at the Human Rights Commission as a human rights
attorney, my mind was elsewhere. I saw a very tough reality. I worked with children who
had to choose between getting an education and actually being forced into marriage. I was
so frustrated seeing all the injustice around me, and my only outlet was art, so I started
painting. This piece is called "Dreamscape." So when you zoom into this piece, you're going
to see a girl child and the accidental birth, the fact that our future is controlled by
where we are born. Now, the next one you see a man and a man holding hands, a woman and a
woman holding hands. You see, in Nigeria, same-sex relationship is criminalized. You can
actually get 14 years for that. With my art, I like to tell stories. Through my art, I like
to start a conversation.

So in this one, you see the map of Africa, you see the questions, you see crying, and
there you see syringes plugged into Africa and the natural resources being drained out. So
I asked myself, where does it go? Who benefits from all of this? You see, with my art, the
way I weave my art around the patterns, the masks, the stories, and the way I use my
lines, it's all from the Yoruba culture. So in 2013, I made a big gamble. I quit my job and
I moved to New York City to practice art full time. Of course, my parents were like, "Oh,
[it's just a phase.] He'll come back." But life as an artist in New York was not easy,
because I was broke, no money, no gallery agents, no representation, so no gallery would
show my work. So I thought to myself, I need to survive. So I started painting on clothes
to make a living. I started painting on shoes. I started customizing things for people.
And then soon I realized the power, because people were so proud to wear their
stories.

So I started painting on everything. I painted on guitars, I started doing murals,
anything I could find my hand on I painted, and everything became my canvas. So one day, I
was just going on my Instagram feed, and I saw this picture. It was Reign. She took a
picture standing in front my art, and the moment I saw that photo, something happened in
that moment. I could actually see my artwork go into her and come out of her literally,
and that's how I started painting on human bodies. As a child I saw art on the marble
floors, I saw art on walls, but now I see art on people's faces and people's bodies. I
remember my grandmother, and I realized that most of my creative instincts were actually
based on my childhood memories and the art on my grandmother's skin. Now I look at all the
people I painted, and I think to myself, like, what would it look like if we all walked
around like gods and goddesses from Yoruba mythology? And boom, that's how The Sacred Art
of the Ori was born.

You see, Ori in Yoruba mythology means your soul, it means your essence, it means your
instincts. And I realized that only when you tap into your Ori, then you can actually move
mountains. So there's something so immediate about painting on human bodies. It's like art
in motion. It's like a 3D experience. So one day, I was just doing my regular work in
Brooklyn, and I got an email that said, "Hi, I'm a big fan of your work. Would you like to
paint for my music video? Signed, Beyoncé." Like, Beyoncé emailed me. I was like,
what?

I was like, what, how did she even know me? I thought this can't be true. Of course I
thought it was a scam. The Nigerian in me was like, nah.

But incredibly enough, it was real, it was true, and things happened really fast. You see,
Beyoncé wanted to pay homage to New Orleans, and my art reminded her of her creole
origins. So when "Lemonade" dropped, of course, boom, everything just went from zero to
100 real fast. People featured me in magazines, interviews. People stopped me in the
street. People knew my name, like — And sometimes I had to step back and just chill, and,
like, take everything in. You know, as artists, we work so hard all our lives for our art
to be recognized, and for this I feel blessed. However, the attorney in me is still there,
so I use my art to fight for what I believe in. My Yoruba heritage is always there. I'd
like to share with you tonight some of my art in motion. Please, welcome with me on
stage.

Now, this is Geli, and this is Reign. These are the first two people I ever painted in my
life, and I spent the past day painting on them. Tonight, they represent my hopes and my
fears. Now, I put my fears on the back. I put my hopes in front. What are my hopes? I hope
that people know that Africa is not just one huge, nameless continent that is all the
same. I also hope that people know that in Nigeria, we have over 350 ethnic groups and
languages, and I am just one artist from one of them.

I also hope that you know that I hope I will be able to change the way people talk about
African art on the continent and here, and I hope you know that African art is not just
what you buy at Harlem markets in New York and that every piece of art you see has a
story, and every artist has a name. Thank you very much.
