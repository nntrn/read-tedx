 Most of the forest lives in the shadow of the giants that make up the highest
 canopy. These are the oldest trees, with hundreds of children and grandchildren.
 They check in with their neighbors, share food, supplies and wisdom gained over
 their lives, all while rooted in place. How do they do this? Camille Defrenne and

Most of the forest lives in the shadow of the giants that make up the highest canopy.
These are the oldest trees, with hundreds of children and thousands of grandchildren.
They check in with their neighbors, sharing food, supplies, and wisdom gained over their
long lives. They do all this rooted in place, unable to speak, reach out, or move around.
The secret to their success lies under the forest floor, where vast root systems support
the towering trunks above. Partnering with these roots are symbiotic fungi called
mycorrhizae. These fungi have countless branching, thread-like hyphae that together make
up the mycelium. The mycelium spreads across a much larger area than the tree root system
and connect the roots of different trees together. These connections form mycorrhizal
networks. Through mycorrhizal networks, fungi can pass resources and signaling molecules
between trees. We know the oldest trees have the largest mycorrhizal networks with the
most connections to other trees, but these connections are incredibly complicated to
trace.

That’s because there are about a hundred species of mycorrhizal fungi– and an individual
tree might be colonized by dozens of different fungal organisms, each of which connects
to a unique set of other trees, which in turn each have their own unique set of fungal
associations. To get a sense of how substances flow through this network, let’s zoom in
on sugars, as they travel from a mature tree to a neighboring seedling. Sugar’s journey
starts high above the ground, in the leaves of the tallest trees above the canopy. The
leaves use the ample sunlight up there to create sugars through photosynthesis. This
essential fuel then travels through the tree to the base of the trunk in the thick
sap. From there, sugar flows down to the roots. Mycorrhizal fungi encounter the tips of
the roots and either surround or penetrate the outer root cells, depending on the type of
fungi. Fungi cannot produce sugars, though they need them for fuel just like trees
do.

They can, however, collect nutrients from the soil much more efficiently than tree roots—
and pass these nutrients into the tree roots. In general, substances flow from where they
are more abundant to where they are less abundant, or from source to sink. That means
that the sugars flow from the tree roots into the fungal hyphae. Once the sugars enter
the fungus, they travel along the hyphae through pores between cells or through special
hollow transporter hyphae. The fungus absorbs some of the sugars, but some travels on and
enters the roots of a neighboring tree, a seedling that grows in the shade and has less
opportunity to photosynthesize sugars. But why does fungus transport resources from tree
to tree? This is one of the mysteries of the mycorrhizal networks. It makes sense for
fungus to exchange soil nutrients and sugar with a tree— both parties benefit. The fungus
likely benefits in less obvious ways from being part of a network between trees, but the
exact ways aren’t totally clear.

Maybe the fungus benefits from having connections with as many different trees as
possible, and maximizes its connections by shuttling molecules between trees. Or maybe
plants reduce their contributions to fungi if the fungi don’t facilitate exchanges 
between trees. Whatever the reasons, these fungi pass an incredible amount of information
between trees. Through the mycorrhizae, trees can tell when nutrients or signaling
molecules are coming from a member of their own species or not. They can even tell when
information is coming from a close relative like a sibling or parent. Trees can also
share information about events like drought or insect attacks through their fungal
networks, causing their neighbors to increase production of protective enzymes in
anticipation of threats. The forest’s health relies on these intricate communications and
exchanges. With everything so deeply interconnected, what impacts one species is bound to
impact others.
