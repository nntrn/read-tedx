title: Why haven't we cured arthritis?

 The bad backs, elbow pain, and creaky knees so common in older people often

While regaling you with daring stories from her youth, it might be hard to believe your 
grandmother used to be a trapeze artist. However, the bad backs, elbow pain, and creaky
knees so common in older people is more than just “old age." In fact, the source of this
stiffness plagues many young people as well. The culprit is arthritis: a condition that
causes inflammation and pain in the joints of over 90 million people in the U.S. alone.
But are stiff, creaky joints really inevitable? What makes arthritis so pervasive, and
why haven’t we found a cure for this widespread condition? The first hurdle is that
arthritis is actually a spectrum of over 100 different arthritic conditions. All these
conditions share symptoms of joint pain and inflammation, but the origin and severity of
those symptoms vary widely. Even the most common type, osteoarthritis, is trickier to
prevent than one might think. It’s a general misconception that arthritis is confined to
old age.

The origins of osteoarthritis can often be traced to a patient’s early life, from any
seemingly ordinary joint injury. Following impact, immune cells rush in to help clean and
repair the damaged site and begin pumping out enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases
 and aggrecanases. These enzymes clear out the damaged tissue and contribute to
inflammation. But while this rapid swelling helps protect the joint during recovery,
inadequately healed tissue can cause these immune cells to overstay their welcome. The
continuing flood of enzymes starts to degrade the cartilage, weakening the joint and
leading to arthritis later on. Not all forms of arthritis can simply be traced to an old
sports injury. Take rheumatoid arthritis, which affects 1.3 million U.S. adults. This
condition is actually an autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies target natively
produced proteins, some of which are secreted by cartilage cells.

We still don’t know what causes this behavior, but the result is that the body treats 
joint tissue like a foreign invader. Immune cells infiltrate the joint despite there
being no tissue damage to repair. This response leads to chronic inflammation, which
destroys bone and cartilage. Yet another condition, spondyloarthritis, has similarities to
both of the conditions we’ve covered. Patients experience continuous inflammation in the
joints and at the sites where ligaments and tendons attach to bones, even without any
initial injury. This leads to the flood of enzymes and degradation seen in
osteoarthritis, but is driven by different inflammatory proteins called cytokines. As the
enzymes eat away at cartilage, the body attempts to stabilize smaller joints by fusing
them together. This process sometimes leads to outgrowths called bone spurs, which also
cause intense stiffness and joint pain. With so many factors causing arthritis, our
current treatments are tailored to tackle specific symptoms rather than underlying
causes.

These range from promising MACI techniques, which harvest cells from small pieces of
cartilage to grow replacement tissue. To a technique called microfracture, where surgeons
create small holes in the bone, allowing bone marrow stem cells to leak out and form new
cartilage. As a last resort, people with withered cartilage can even undergo full joint
replacements. But outside these drastic measures, the underlying drivers of autoimmune
arthritis still present a unique treatment challenge. Scientists are making progress with
 therapies that block TNF-alpha, one of the primary proteins causing inflammation in
rheumatoid arthritis. But even this approach only treats the symptoms of the condition,
not the cause. In the meantime, some of our best defenses against arthritis are lifestyle
choices: maintaining a healthy weight to take pressure off joints, low-impact exercises
like yoga or cycling, and avoiding smoking.

These arthritis-fighting behaviors can help us lead longer lives as we continue to
research cures and treatments for the huge diversity of arthritic conditions.
