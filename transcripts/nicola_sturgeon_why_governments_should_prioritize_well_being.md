title: Why governments should prioritize well-being
speaker: Nicola Sturgeon
description: >-
 In 2018, Scotland, Iceland and New Zealand established the network of Wellbeing
 Economy Governments to challenge the acceptance of GDP as the ultimate measure of
 a country's success. In this visionary talk, First Minister of Scotland Nicola
 Sturgeon explains the far-reaching implications of a "well-being economy" --
 which places factors like equal pay, childcare, mental health and access to green
 space at its heart -- and shows how this new focus could help build resolve to
 confront global challenges.

Just over a mile away from here, in Edinburgh's Old Town, is Panmure House. Panmure House
was the home of the world-renowned Scottish economist Adam Smith. In his important work
"The Wealth of Nations," Adam Smith argued, amongst many other things, that the
measurement of a country's wealth was not just its gold and silver reserves. It was the
totality of the country's production and commerce. I guess it was one of the earliest
descriptions of what we now know today as gross domestic product, GDP.Now, in the years
since, of course, that measurement of production and commerce, GDP, has become ever more
important, to the point that today — and I don't believe this is what Adam Smith would
have intended — that it is often seen as the most important measurement of a country's
overall success. And my argument today is that it is time for that to change. You know,
what we choose to measure as a country matters. It really matters, because it drives
political focus, it drives public activity.

And against that context, I think the limitations of GDP as a measurement of a country's
success are all too obvious. You know, GDP measures the output of all of our work, but it
says nothing about the nature of that work, about whether that work is worthwhile or
fulfilling. It puts a value, for example, on illegal drug consumption, but not on unpaid
care. It values activity in the short term that boosts the economy, even if that activity
is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term. And we reflect
on the past decade of political and economic upheaval, of growing inequalities, and when
we look ahead to the challenges of the climate emergency, increasing automation, an aging
population, then I think the argument for the case for a much broader definition of what
it means to be successful as a country, as a society, is compelling, and increasingly
so. And that is why Scotland, in 2018, took the lead, took the initiative in establishing a
new network called the Wellbeing Economy Governments group, bringing together as founding
members the countries of Scotland, Iceland and New Zealand, for obvious
reasons.

We're sometimes called the SIN countries, although our focus is very much on the common
good. And the purpose of this group is to challenge that focus on the narrow measurement
of GDP. To say that, yes, economic growth matters — it is important — but it is not all
that is important. And growth in GDP should not be pursued at any or all cost. In fact,
the argument of that group is that the goal, the objective of economic policy should be
collective well-being: how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a
population is. And I'll touch on the policy implications of that in a moment. But I think,
particularly in the world we live in today, it has a deeper resonance. You know, when we
focus on well-being, we start a conversation that provokes profound and fundamental
questions. What really matters to us in our lives? What do we value in the communities we
live in? What kind of country, what kind of society, do we really want to
be?

And when we engage people in those questions, in finding the answers to those questions,
then I believe that we have a much better chance of addressing the alienation and
disaffection from politics that is so prevalent in so many countries across the developed
world today. In policy terms, this journey for Scotland started back in 2007, when we
published what we call our National Performance Framework, looking at the range of
indicators that we measure ourselves against. And those indicators are as varied as income
inequality, the happiness of children, access to green spaces, access to housing. None of
these are captured in GDP statistics, but they are all fundamental to a healthy and a
happy society.

And that broader approach is at the heart of our economic strategy, where we give equal
importance to tackling inequality as we do to economic competitiveness. It drives our
commitment to fair work, making sure that work is fulfilling and well-paid. It's behind
our decision to establish a Just Transition Commission to guide our path to a carbon zero
economy. We know from economic transformations of the past that if we're not careful,
there are more losers than winners. And as we face up to the challenges of climate change
and automation, we must not make those mistakes again. The work we're doing here in
Scotland is, I think, significant, but we have much, much to learn from other countries. I
mentioned, a moment ago, our partner nations in the Wellbeing network: Iceland and New
Zealand. It's worth noting, and I'll leave it to you to decide whether this is relevant or
not, that all three of these countries are currently led by women.

They, too, are doing great work. New Zealand, in 2019, publishing its first Wellbeing
Budget, with mental health at its heart; Iceland leading the way on equal pay, childcare
and paternity rights — not policies that we immediately think of when we talk about
creating a wealthy economy, but policies that are fundamental to a healthy economy and a
happy society. I started with Adam Smith and "The Wealth of Nations." In Adam Smith's
earlier work, "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," which I think is just as important, he
made the observation that the value of any government is judged in proportion to the
extent that it makes its people happy. I think that is a good founding principle for any
group of countries focused on promoting well-being. None of us have all of the answers,
not even Scotland, the birthplace of Adam Smith. But in the world we live in today, with
growing divides and inequalities, with disaffection and alienation, it is more important
than ever that we ask and find the answers to those questions and promote a vision of
society that has well-being, not just wealth, at its very heart.

You are right now in the beautiful, sunny capital city ...

of the country that led the world in the Enlightenment, the country that helped lead the
world into the industrial age, the country that right now is helping to lead the world
into the low carbon age. I want, and I'm determined, that Scotland will also be the
country that helps change the focus of countries and governments across the world to put
well-being at the heart of everything that we do. I think we owe that to this generation.
I certainly believe we owe that to the next generation and all those that come after us.
And if we do that, led here from the country of the Enlightenment, then I think we create
a better, healthier, fairer and happier society here at home. And we play our part in
Scotland in building a fairer, happier world as well. Thank you very much.
