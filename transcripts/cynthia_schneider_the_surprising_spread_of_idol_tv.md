I'd like to ask you, what do these three people have in common? Well, you probably
recognize the first person. I'm sure you're all avid "American Idol" watchers. But you
might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani, who is a contestant, indeed a finalist, in the Poet
of the Millions competition, which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi, and seen throughout the
Arab world. In this contest people have to write and recite original poetry, in the Nabati
form of poetry, which is the traditional Bedouin form. And Lima Sahar was a finalist in
the Afghan Star singing competition. Now, before I go any further, yes, I know it all began
with "Britain's Got Talent." But my point in discussing this is to show you — I hope I'll
be able to show you how these merit-based competitions, with equal access to everyone,
with the winner selected via voting by SMS, are changing tribal societies. And I'm going
to focus on Afghanistan and the Arab world with the UAE, how they're changing tribal
societies, not by introducing Western ideas, but by being integrated into the language in
those places. It all begins with enjoyment.

Video: We are late to watch "Afghan Star." We are going to watch "Afghan Star." We are
late. We are running late. We must go to watch "Afghan Star." Cynthia Schneider: These
programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society. In Afghanistan, people go to
extraordinary lengths to be able to watch this program. And you don't necessarily have to
have your own TV set. People watch it all over the country also in public places. But it
goes beyond watching, because also, part of this is campaigning. People become so engaged
that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway, who fan out over the
countryside, campaigning for their candidate. Contestants also put themselves forward. Now,
of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely. Because each
year the winner has come from a different tribal group. This has opened up the door,
particularly for women. And in the last season there were two women in the
finalists.

One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar, a very conservative part of the
country. And here she relates, in the documentary film "Afghan Star," how her friends
urged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy. But she
also confides that she knows that members of the Taliban are actually SMS-ing votes in for
her. Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks and put herself out, to compete in the Poet of the
Millions competition. I have to say, her husband backed her from the start. But her tribe
and family urged her not to compete and were very much against it. But, once she started
to win, then they got behind her again. It turns out that competition and winning is a
universal human value. And she's out there. Her poetry is about women, and the life of
women in society. So just by presenting herself and being in competition with men — this
shows the voting on the program — it sets a very important example for young women — these
are young women in the audience of the program — in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the
viewing audience. Now you'd think that "American Idol" would introduce a measure of
Americanization.

But actually, just the opposite is happening. By using this engaging popular format for
traditional, local culture, it actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival of
interest in Nabati poetry, also in traditional dress and dance and music. And for
Afghanistan, where the Taliban banned music for many years, it is reintroducing their
traditional music. They don't sing pop songs, they sing Afghan music. And they also have
learned how to lose gracefully, without avenging the winner. 

No small thing. And the final, sort of, formulation of this "American Idol" format, which
has just appeared in Afghanistan, is a new program called "The Candidate." And in this
program, people present policy platforms that are then voted on. Many of them are too
young to run for president, but by putting the issues out there, they are influencing the
presidential race. So for me, the substance of things unseen is how reality TV is driving
reality. Thank you.
