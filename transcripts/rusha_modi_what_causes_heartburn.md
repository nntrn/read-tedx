Just between your chest and abdomen is where you’ll find one of the most important muscles
you probably didn't know you had: the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES. When functioning
properly, this ring of tissue plays a crucial role in helping us eat. But when the LES
malfunctions, it becomes the main player in heartburn —a searing, sometimes sour-tasting
chest-spasm that many people will experience at some point in their lives. We know that
humans have been battling heartburn for hundreds, if not thousands of years. But recently
the incidence has risen, making it a common stomach complaint worldwide. When the
symptoms of heartburn become more more regular and intense —such as twice a week or more—
it’s diagnosed as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, or GERD. But what causes this problem,
and how can it be stopped? Heartburn starts in an area called the gastroesophageal
junction, where the LES resides.

This smooth, muscular ring of the LES is moderated by an intricate tree of nerve roots
that connect to the brain, the heart, and the lungs. After food enters the stomach from
the esophagus, the muscle’s task is to stop it from surging back up again. The LES
contracts, squeezing the stomach entrance and creating a high pressure zone that prevents
digestive acids from seeping out. But if the LES relaxes at the wrong moment or gradually
weakens, it becomes like a faulty, ill-fitting lid, causing the area to depressurize. That
allows burning stomach acid— and even chunks of food—to spurt into the esophagus,
sometimes going as far up as the mouth. The cause of all this internal drama has long been
put down to diet. Foods like caffeine and peppermint contain ingredients that may have a
relaxing affect on the LES, which makes it incapable of doing its job. Other acidic foods,
 like citrus and tomatoes, can worsen irritation of the esophagus when they leach out with
stomach acid.

Carbonated beverages can similarly bubble up in the stomach, forcing open the valve. But
researchers have discovered that food isn’t the only trigger. Smoking poses a risk,
because the nicotine in cigarettes relaxes the LES. Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol
may have a similar effect. Pregnant women often experience more heartburn due to the
pressure of a growing baby on their stomachs. and the levels of certain hormones in their
bodies. Obesity can cause hernias that disrupt the anti-reflux barrier of the
gastroesophageal junction that normally protects against heartburn. Numerous medications,
 including those for asthma, high blood pressure, birth control, and depression can also
have unintended effects on the LES.An occasional bout of heartburn isn't necessarily
something to worry about. But, if heartburn starts happening regularly, it can weaken the
LES muscle over time, letting more and more acid escape.

And if it goes untreated, this can cause bigger problems. Over time, constant acid leakage
from heartburn may form scar tissue which narrows the esophageal tube, making it harder
to swallow food. Ongoing reflux can also damage the cells lining the esophagus—a rare
condition called Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate the risk of esophageal
cancer. Luckily, heartburn is often treatable with a range of medicines that can help
neutralize or reduce stomach acid. In extreme cases, some people have surgery to tighten
the LES to minimize their distress. But we can often stop heartburn before it reaches that
point. Reducing the consumption of certain foods, not smoking, and maintaining a healthy
weight can all dramatically reduce reflux. With proper care we can help our LES’s keep
the chemical fountain of our stomachs in proper order and avoid having to feel the
burn.
