title: What is dyslexia?
speaker: Kelli Sandman-Hurley
description: >-
 Dyslexia affects up to 1 in 5 people, but the experience of dyslexia isn't always
 the same. This difficulty in processing language exists along a spectrum -- one
 that doesn't necessarily fit with labels like "normal" and "defective." Kelli
 Sandman-Hurley urges us to think again about dyslexic brain function and to
 celebrate the neurodiversity of the human brain. [Directed by Marc Christoforidis,
 narrated by Michelle Snow].

Take a moment to read the following. How was that? Frustrating? Slow? What were those
sentences about? They're actually a simulation of the experience of dyslexia, designed to
make you decode each word. Those with dyslexia experience that laborious pace every time
they read. When most people think of dyslexia, they think of seeing letters and words
backwards, like seeing "b" as "d" and vice versa, or they might think people with dyslexia
see "saw" as "was". The truth is people with dyslexia see things the same way as everyone
else. Dyslexia is caused by a phonological processing problem, meaning people affected by
it have trouble not with seeing language but with manipulating it. For example, if you
heard the word cat and then someone asked you, "Remove the 'c'," what word would you have
left? At. This can be difficult for those with dyslexia. Given a word in isolation, like
fantastic, students with dyslexia need to break the word into parts to read it: fan, tas,
tic.

Time spent decoding makes it hard to keep up with peers and gain sufficient comprehension.
Spelling words phonetically, like s-t-i-k for stick and f-r-e-n-s for friends is also
common. These difficulties are more widespread and varied than commonly imagined. Dyslexia
affects up to one in five people. It occurs on a continuum. One person might have mild
dyslexia while the next person has a profound case of it. Dyslexia also runs in families.
It's common to see one family member who has trouble spelling while another family member
has severe difficulty decoding even one syllable words, like catch. The continuum and
distribution of dyslexia suggests a broader principle to bear in mind as we look at how
the brains of those with dyslexia process language. Neurodiversity is the idea that
because all our brains show differences in structure and function, we shouldn't be so
quick to label every deviation from "the norm" as a pathological disorder or dismiss
people living with these variations as "defective." People with neurobiological variations
like dyslexia, including such creative and inventive individuals as Picasso, Muhammad Ali,
Whoopi Goldberg, Steven Spielberg, and Cher, clearly have every capacity to be brilliant
and successful in life.

So, here's the special way the brains of those with dyslexia work. The brain is divided
into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere is generally in charge of language and,
ultimately, reading, while the right typically handles spatial activities. fMRI studies
have found that the brains of those with dyslexia rely more on the right hemisphere and
frontal lobe than the brains of those without it. This means, when they read a word, it
takes a longer trip through their brain and can get delayed in the frontal lobe. Because
of this neurobiological glitch, they read with more difficulty. But those with dyslexia
can physically change their brain and improve their reading with an intensive,
multi-sensory intervention that breaks the language down and teaches the reader to decode
based on syllable types and spelling rules. The brains of those with dyslexia begin using
the left hemisphere more efficiently while reading, and their reading improves.

The intervention works because it locates dyslexia appropriately as a functional variation
in the brain, which, naturally, shows all sorts of variations from one person to another.
Neurodiversity emphasizes this spectrum of brain function in all humans and suggests that
to better understand the perspectives of those around us, we should try not only to see
the world through their eyes but understand it through their brains.
