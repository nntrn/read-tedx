title: Dangerous times call for dangerous women
speaker: Pat Mitchell
description: >-
 Pat Mitchell has nothing left to prove and much less to lose -- she's become a
 "dangerous woman." Not dangerous as in feared, she says, but fearless: a force to
 be reckoned with. In this powerful call to action, Mitchell invites all women,
 men and allies to join her in embracing the risks necessary to create a world
 where safety, respect and truth burn brighter than the darkness of our current
 times.

Recently, I've been declaring to anyone who would listen that I am a dangerous
woman.

Now, declaring that boldly like this still feels a bit dangerous, but it also feels right.
At this time in my life, about to be 77, I have —

I love when you're applauded for your age —

but I'll take it.

About to be 77, I realize that I have nothing left to prove, less to lose, and I'm more
impatient about everything. The true, slow pace towards equality, the rise in sexism,
racism, violence against women and girls ... And I'm angry, too, at the climate deniers
who are stealing the future from our children and grandchildren. Friends, we are living in
dangerous times. And such times call for all of us to be more dangerous. Now, what do I
mean by this? I don't mean being feared. It's not that kind of dangerous. But I do mean
being more fearless. I mean speaking the truth when silence is a lot safer. I mean
speaking up in rooms for those who aren't present, especially those rooms where decisions
are made about our lives and our bodies. We need to be in those rooms, showing up for one
another, challenging the cultural construct that encourages us, especially women and
girls, to compete, compare, criticize. We have to end this.

And speaking out against the policies and the politics that divide us and diminish our
collective power as a global community of women, and the men and the allies who stand with
us. Becoming dangerous also means embracing whatever risks are necessary to create a world
where women and girls are safe in their homes and at work, where all voices are
represented and respected, all votes counted, the planet protected. And this is all
possible. Because we're ready for this. We're better prepared than any generation ever
before us, better resourced, better connected. In many parts of the world, we're living
longer than ever. Women over 65 are among the fastest-growing populations on earth, with
the potential for becoming the most powerful, too. Now —

What a change this represents. Postmenopausal women like me, not that long ago, were
considered useless or crazy. We were valued for caregiving and grandmothering — and I
really love that part. But we were pushed aside and expected to retire to our rocking
chairs. Women on the dangerous side of 60 are not retiring. We are rewiring
—

taking all that we know and have done — and that is a lot — to redefine what age looks
like, can do, can accomplish. But becoming dangerous isn't about becoming a certain age,
because at each end of the age spectrum, brave women and girls are stepping up, taking the
risk to create change. I became a risk-taker early in my life's journey. I had to, or have
my life defined by the limitations for a girl growing up in the rural South, with no
money, no connections, no influence. But what wasn't limited was my curiosity about the
world beyond my small town, beyond the small minds of a still-segregated South, a world
that I glimpsed in the newsreels at the one movie theater in town, and a world that got a
lot closer to me when I met Miss Shirley Rountree, my eighth-grade English teacher. From
the minute she walked into the classroom, her high heels clicking, she was a woman in
charge, with perfect hair, signature red lips, colorfully coordinated, head to toe. I
wanted to be her.

Gratefully, she became my first mentor and helped me become me. With her support, I got a
scholarship to college — the first in my family — and landed at a big state university,
right in the middle of two great social justice movements: civil rights for African
Americans and equal rights for women. I joined both with enthusiasm, only to discover that
my newfound activism and my fermenting feminism would often be in direct conflict with my
deeply embedded need to please and be popular. In my first job as a college teacher, I
broke the rules, and I encouraged students to join me in the protest marches. And when I
found out that my male colleague with the same experience and education was being paid
more than me, I mounted a personal protest. When my raise was denied, with the excuse that
he had a family to support, so did I as a single mom. But I dropped my protest to keep my
job. Today, millions of women are making this compromise, staying in their jobs without
equal pay for equal work. And as one of the first women on television in the '70s, I was
warned that focusing on women's stories would limit my career opportunities, and maybe it
did.

But I got to produce and host breakthrough programming for women, while at the same time,
remaining silent about sexual harassment and listening to consultants who were hired to
advise me about my appearance. "Become a blonde." I did. "Lower your voice." I tried.
"Lower your necklines." I didn't.

But I did wear those ugly anchor suits with those scarves that look something like men's
ties. And later, in the power positions in media, often as the first or only woman, aware
of being judged through that gender lens, I struggled from time to time to find the right
balance between being a leader for women and not being entirely defined as a woman leader.
But today, I'm proud to be known as a woman leader.

As an activist, advocate, feminist and as a newly declared dangerous woman, I'm caring
less what others say and saying more clearly what I think and feel. And let me be clear: I
acknowledge my privilege in being able to do that, to speak my truth. And to stand here
today with this opportunity to talk to you about women and power — note I did not say
"empowered." I don't think we're waiting to be empowered. I think we have
power.

What we need are more opportunities to claim it, to use it, to share it. And yes, I know —
there are women with power who don't use it well or wisely and who don't share it. I've
heard, as I'm sure you have, those stories that begin with, "The worst boss I ever had was
a woman ... " And we could all name women leaders who have not made us proud. But we can
change all of that with a simple but brilliant idea that I first heard from a risk-taking,
dangerous congresswoman from New York named Bella Abzug. Bella said, "In the 21st century,
women will change the nature of power rather than power changing the nature of women."
From the moment I heard that —

I thought, "This is our call to action. This is our biggest opportunity."And as a
journalist and an activist, I've seen this idea in action, documenting the stories of
women on both sides in long-term conflicts, coming together and defying the official power
to form alliances and find their own ways to ending violence in their communities. And as
an activist, I've traveled to places where it's dangerous to be born a woman, like eastern
Congo, where a war is being waged on the bodies of women. There, at a healing and
leadership center called City of Joy, brave Congolese women are transforming pain into
power by training survivors of sexual assault to return to their villages as leaders. And
at recent climate summits, I've observed women climate leaders working behinds the scenes,
out of the public spotlight, making sure that the negotiations toward global climate
agreement continue to move forward. So as we move forward in our lives and work and we have
more power and influence, let's change the nature of power by dismantling some of the
barriers that remain for those who follow by advocating and agitating for fairer and truer
and more equal representation in every room and at every table. Now, be warned: if you
advocate for a woman for an open position or promotion, you could be challenged with,
"You're playing the women's card" or "the race card" if advocating for a woman of
color.

I've had this experience, as I'm sure you have. "Are you running an affirmative action
program here at PBS?" asked one of my board members when, as a new president, I announced
my first hires as five qualified women. Now, my affirmative action had been to ask that
the search firm bring me a candidate list that included the names of women and people of
color who just happened to be, in my judgment, the best candidates for the position as
well. I say, dangerous women and our allies: it's time to play the women's card, play the
race card, play all our cards.

Not to win the power game, but to lead to better outcomes for everyone. And it's time, too,
to discard that scarcity theory, the one that says, there's only room for one of us at the
top, so protect your turf, don't make friends or allies. Changing the nature of power
transforms "protect your turf" into "share your turf," it encourages coalitions, it builds
alliances, it strengthens and sustains friendships. My women friends are my source of
renewable energy.

So are my mentors, my champions, my supporters, my sponsors, and all of the ways that we
can and do show up for each other. We can become our sources of renewable power for each
other. And along the way, we need to take better care of ourselves, and here, I am not the
best role model. I don't meditate. I don't exercise regularly. But I do live
aerobically.

Because I believe we can't be dangerous from the sidelines, and there's just too much to
be done. So let's use all our power. How about the power of money? Let's allocate more of
our philanthropic dollars, our campaign donations, our investment funds, to increase
economic and political equity. And let's leverage the power of media and technology that
we have in our hands, quite literally, to elevate each other's stories and ideas; to
practice civility; to seek the truth, which is diminishing and is threatening free and
open societies. Yes, we have all that we need to move our communities forward. And the best
thing we have, and what we must remember, is to be there for each other. We will move
forward together, willing now to take more risk, to be more fearless, to speak up, speak
out and show up for one another. George Bernard Shaw once wrote that he believed in his
opinion that his life belonged to the community, that the harder he worked, the more he
lived and that he wanted to be thoroughly used up when he died.

He went on to write, "Life is no brief candle to me but a splendid torch that I have got
hold of for a moment before passing to future generations." I, too, do not view my life as
a brief candle, although I am burning it at both ends.

And I do want it, and me, to be thoroughly used up when I die. But at this point in my
life's journey, I am not passing my torch. I am holding it higher than ever, boldly,
brilliantly, inviting you to join me in its dangerous light. Thank you.
