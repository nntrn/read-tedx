 Few individuals have influenced the world and many of today's thinkers like
 Plato. He created the first Western university and was teacher to Ancient
 Greece's greatest minds, including Aristotle. But even he wasn't perfect. Along

Few individuals have influenced the world and many of today's thinkers like Plato. One
20th century philosopher even went so far as to describe all of Western philosophy as a
series of footnotes to Plato. He created the first Western university and was teacher to
Ancient Greece's greatest minds, including Aristotle. But even one of the founders of
philosophy wasn't perfect. Along with his great ideas, Plato had a few that haven't 
exactly stood the test of time. So here are brief rundowns of a few of his best and worst
ideas. Plato argued that beyond our imperfect world was a perfect unchanging world of
Forms. Forms are the ideal versions of the things and concepts we see around us. They
serve as a sort of instruction manual to our own world. Floating around the world of Forms
is the ideal tree, and the ideal YouTube channel, and even the ideal justice, or ideal
love. Our own reality is comprised of imperfect copies of ideal Forms.

Plato argued that philosophers should strive to contemplate and understand these perfect
Forms so that they may better navigate our misleading reality. While it may seem silly,
the disconnect between the world as it appears and the greater truth behind it is one of
philosophy's most vexing problems. It's been the subject of thousands of pages by
theologians, philosophers, and screenwriters alike. It raises questions like should we
trust our senses to come to the truth or our own reason? For Plato, the answer is reason.
It alone provides us with at least the potential to contemplate the Forms. But reason
didn't always pan out for Plato himself. When he sought to situate humankind amongst the
animals, he lumped us in with birds. "Featherless bipeds" was his official designation.
Diogenes the Cynic, annoyed by this definition, stormed into Plato's class with a plucked
chicken, announcing, "Behold. Plato's man." But back to a few good ideas.

Plato is one of the earliest political theorists on record, and with Aristotle, is seen
as one of the founders of political science. He reasoned that being a ruler was no
different than any other craft, whether a potter or doctor, and that only those who had
mastered the craft were fit to lead. Ruling was the craft of contemplating the Forms. In
his Republic, Plato imagined a utopia where justice is the ultimate goal. Plato's ideal
city seeks a harmonious balance between its individual parts and should be lead by a
philosopher king. Millennia before his time, Plato also reasoned that women were equally
able to rule in this model city. Unfortunately, Plato was inconsistent with women,
elsewhere likening them to children. He also believed that a woman's womb was a live
animal that could wander around in her body and cause illness. This bad idea, also
espoused by other contemporaries of Plato, was sadly influential for hundreds of years in
European medicine.

Furthermore, he thought that society should be divided into three groups: producers, the
military, and the rulers, and that a great noble lie should convince everyone to follow
this structure. The noble lie he proposed was that we're all born with gold, silver, or a
mixture of brass and iron in our souls, which determine our roles in life. Some thinkers
have gone on to credit the idea of the noble lie as a prototype for 20th century
propaganda, and the philosopher king as inspiration for the dictators that used them.
Should a few bad ideas tarnish Plato's status as one of the greatest philosophers in
history? No! Plato gave the leaders and thinkers who came after him a place to start.
Through the centuries, we've had the chance to test those ideas through writing and
experience, and have accepted some while rejecting others. We are continuing to refine,
amend, and edit his ideas which have become foundations of the modern world.
