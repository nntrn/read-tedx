Statistics are persuasive. So much so that people, organizations, and whole countries base
some of their most important decisions on organized data. But there's a problem with
that. Any set of statistics might have something lurking inside it, something that can
turn the results completely upside down. For example, imagine you need to choose between
two hospitals for an elderly relative's surgery. Out of each hospital's last 1000
patient's, 900 survived at Hospital A, while only 800 survived at Hospital B. So it looks
like Hospital A is the better choice. But before you make your decision, remember that
not all patients arrive at the hospital with the same level of health. And if we divide
each hospital's last 1000 patients into those who arrived in good health and those who
arrived in poor health, the picture starts to look very different. Hospital A had only 100
patients who arrived in poor health, of which 30 survived. But Hospital B had 400, and
they were able to save 210.

So Hospital B is the better choice for patients who arrive at hospital in poor health,
with a survival rate of 52.5%. And what if your relative's health is good when she arrives
at the hospital? Strangely enough, Hospital B is still the better choice, with a survival
rate of over 98%. So how can Hospital A have a better overall survival rate if Hospital B
has better survival rates for patients in each of the two groups? What we've stumbled upon
is a case of Simpson's paradox, where the same set of data can appear to show opposite
trends depending on how it's grouped. This often occurs when aggregated data hides a
conditional variable, sometimes known as a lurking variable, which is a hidden additional
factor that significantly influences results. Here, the hidden factor is the relative
proportion of patients who arrive in good or poor health. Simpson's paradox isn't just a
hypothetical scenario. It pops up from time to time in the real world, sometimes in
important contexts.

One study in the UK appeared to show that smokers had a higher survival rate than
nonsmokers over a twenty-year time period. That is, until dividing the participants by age
group showed that the nonsmokers were significantly older on average, and thus, more
likely to die during the trial period, precisely because they were living longer in
general. Here, the age groups are the lurking variable, and are vital to correctly 
interpret the data. In another example, an analysis of Florida's death penalty cases
seemed to reveal no racial disparity in sentencing between black and white defendants
convicted of murder. But dividing the cases by the race of the victim told a different
story. In either situation, black defendants were more likely to be sentenced to death.
The slightly higher overall sentencing rate for white defendants was due to the fact 
that cases with white victims were more likely to elicit a death sentence than cases
where the victim was black, and most murders occurred between people of the same
race.

So how do we avoid falling for the paradox? Unfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all
answer. Data can be grouped and divided in any number of ways, and overall numbers may
sometimes give a more accurate picture than data divided into misleading or arbitrary
categories. All we can do is carefully study the actual situations the statistics describe
and consider whether lurking variables may be present. Otherwise, we leave ourselves
vulnerable to those who would use data to manipulate others and promote their own
agendas.
