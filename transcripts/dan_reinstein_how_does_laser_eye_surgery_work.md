In 1948, Spanish ophthalmologist Jose Ignacio Barraquer Moner was fed up with glasses. He
wanted a solution for blurry vision that fixed the eye itself, without relying on
external aids. But the surgery he eventually devised was not for the faint of heart.
Barraquer began by slicing off the front of a patient’s cornea and dunking it in liquid
nitrogen. Using a miniature lathe, he ground the frozen cornea into the precise shape
necessary to focus the patient’s vision. Then he thawed the disc, and sewed it back on.
Barraquer called this procedure keratomileusis, from the Greek words for “carving” and
“cornea.” And though it might sound grisly, his technique produced reliable results. So
how did Barraquer’s surgery work? Keratomileusis corrects what are called refractive
errors: imperfections in the way the eye focuses incoming light. Ideally, the cornea and
lens work together to focus light on the surface of the retina, but several kinds of
refractive errors can impair this delicate system.

In people with myopia, or short-sightedness, a steep cornea focuses light just short of
the retina. Those with hyperopia, or far-sightedness, have the opposite problem: light is
focused too far beyond the retina. And in people with astigmatism, the cornea has two
different curvatures which focus light at two distances and produce blurry vision. Even
those with perfect vision will eventually suffer from presbyopia, or “aging eyes.” As the
proteins in the lens age, they slowly increase its size. By an adult’s mid-40’s, the lens
is too large to easily change shape and shift focus. Glasses and contact lenses bend light 
to compensate for these refractive errors. But, as Barraquer’s procedure shows, we can
also alter the shape of the cornea itself; moving the focal point backwards, forwards,
or pulling a divided image together. And thankfully, modern eye surgeons can sculpt the
cornea with far less invasive tools. In corrective laser eye surgery, surgeons rely on
excimer lasers.

These tools are accurate enough to etch words into a human hair. To safely accomplish
these ultra-fine incisions, they use a technique called photoablation. This allows the
laser to essentially evaporate organic tissue without overheating surrounding eye
tissue. So how does laser eye surgery actually work? The first step is to separate a thin
layer from the front of the cornea. This can be done with either a flat, wide blade, or a
femto-second laser that produces millions of tiny plasma bubbles to create a plane
beneath the corneal surface. Surgeons then lift the flap to expose the inside of the
cornea. Guided by the refractive error and the shape of the cornea, the excimer laser
robotically sculpts the exposed corneal bed into the correct shape. This process usually
takes less than 30 seconds for each eye. Finally, the flap is closed, and its edges
reseal themselves in just a few hours. Because the lasering is done on the eyeball
itself, it’s described as “in situ,” or “on site.” Its complete name is “laser in-situ 
keratomileusis” – but you probably know it as LASIK.

Essentially, this technique carves a patient’s contact lens prescription onto their
cornea. Like any surgical procedure, LASIK comes with certain risks. Some patients
experience slightly blurred vision that can’t be corrected by glasses. But the technique
is currently about as likely to damage your eyes as wearing daily disposable contact 
lenses for one year. Today, a technique called SMILE enables surgeons to sculpt the cornea
through even smaller incisions – further reducing recovery time. And lasers aren’t just
correcting the three types of refractive errors – this technology can also restore aging
eyes. In a technique called Laser Blended Vision, surgeons adjust one eye to be slightly 
better at distance vision and the other to be better at close range vision. The
difference between the two eyes is small enough that most patients can merge their
vision, allowing both eyes to work together at all distances. Advances in laser technology
continue to make vision correction surgery more effective and accessible.

One day soon, Barraquer’s vision of a world without glasses may finally come
true.
