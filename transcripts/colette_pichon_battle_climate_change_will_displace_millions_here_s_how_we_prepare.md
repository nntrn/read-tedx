title: Climate change will displace millions. Here's how we prepare
speaker: Colette Pichon Battle
description: >-
 Scientists predict climate change will displace more than 180 million people by
 2100 -- a crisis of "climate migration" the world isn't ready for, says disaster
 recovery lawyer and Louisiana native Colette Pichon Battle. In this passionate,
 lyrical talk, she urges us to radically restructure the economic and social
 systems that are driving climate migration -- and caused it in the first place --
 and shares how we can cultivate collective resilience, better prepare before
 disaster strikes and advance human rights for all.

It was about two years after Hurricane Katrina that I first saw the Louisiana flood maps.
These flood maps are used to show land loss in the past and land loss that is to come. On
this particular day, at a community meeting, these maps were used to explain how a 30-foot
tidal surge that accompanied Hurricane Katrina could flood communities like mine in south
Louisiana and communities across the Mississippi and Alabama coast. It turns out that the
land we were losing was our buffer from the sea. I volunteered to interact with the
graphics on the wall, and in an instant my life changed for the second time in two years.
The graphic showed massive land loss in south Louisiana and an encroaching sea, but more
specifically, the graphic showed the disappearance of my community and many other
communities before the end of the century. I wasn't alone at the front of the room. I was
standing there with other members of south Louisiana's communities — black, Native,
poor.

We thought we were just bound by temporary disaster recovery, but we found that we were
now bound by the impossible task of ensuring that our communities would not be erased by
sea level rise due to climate change. Friends, neighbors, family, my community: I just
assumed it would always be there. Land, trees, marsh, bayous: I just assumed that it would
be there as it had been for thousands of years. I was wrong. To understand what was
happening to my community, I had to talk to other communities around the globe. I started
in south Louisiana with the United Houma Nation. I talked to youth advocates in
Shishmaref, Alaska. I talked to fisherwomen in coastal Vietnam, justice fighters in Fiji,
new generations of leaders in the ancient cultures of the Torres Straits. Communities that
had been here for thousands of years were suffering the same fate, and we were all
contemplating how we would survive the next 50.By the end of the next century, it's
predicted that more than 180 million people will be displaced due to climate change, and
in south Louisiana, those who can afford to do so are already moving.

They're moving because south Louisiana is losing land at one of the fastest rates on the
planet. Disappearance is what my bayou community has in common with other coastal
communities. Erasure is what communities around the globe are fighting as we get real
about the impacts of climate change. I've spent the last 14 years advocating on behalf of
communities that have been directly impacted by the climate crisis. These communities are
fighting discrimination within climate disaster recovery, and they're also trying to
balance mass displacement of people with an influx of others who see opportunity in
starting anew. Since 2005, people have been called "refugees" when they leave when they're
displaced by climate disaster, even when they don't cross international borders. These
terms, these misused terms, that are meant to identify the other, the victim, the person
who is not supposed to be here, these terms are barriers to economic recovery, to social
integration and to the healing required from the climate crisis and climate
trauma.

Words matter. It also matters how we treat people who are crossing borders. We should care
about how people who are crossing borders today to seek refuge and safety are being
treated, if for no other reason than it might be you or someone you love who needs to
exercise their human right to migrate in the nearby future. We must start preparing for
global migration today. It's a reality now. Our cities and our communities are not
prepared. In fact, our economic system and our social systems are only prepared to make
profit off of people who migrate. This will cause rounds of climate gentrification, and it
will also penalize the movement of people, usually through exploited labor and usually
through criminalization. Climate gentrification that happens in anticipation of sea level
rise is what we're seeing in places like Miami, where communities that were kept from the
waterfront are now being priced out of the high ground where they were placed originally
as people move away from the coast.

These folks are being moved, forced to relocate away from the social and economic systems
that they need to survive. Climate gentrification also happens in the aftermath of climate
disaster. When massive amounts of people leave a location for an indefinite amount of
time, we see others come in. We also see climate gentrification happen when damaged homes
are now "green built," but now have a higher value, generally outside of the reach of
black and brown and poor people who want to return home. The price difference in rents or
the ownership of a house is the difference between being able to practice your right, your
human right to return home as a community, or be forced to resettle somewhere else less
climate resilient, less expensive and alone. The climate crisis is a much larger
conversation than reducing CO2 emissions, and it is a much different conversation than
just extreme weather. We're facing a shift in every aspect of our global
reality.

And climate migration is just one small part, but it's going to have ripple effects in
both coastal cities and cities in the interior. So what do we do? I have a few
ideas.

First, we must reframe our understanding of the problem. Climate change is not the
problem. Climate change is the most horrible symptom of an economic system that has been
built for a few to extract every precious value out of this planet and its people, from
our natural resources to the fruits of our human labor. This system has created this
crisis.

We must have the courage to admit we've taken too much. We cannot close our eyes to the
fact that the entire world is paying a price for the privilege and comfort of just a few
people on the planet. It's time for us to make society-wide changes to a system that
incentivizes consumption to the point of global imbalance. Our social, political and
economic systems of extraction must be transformed into systems that regenerate the earth
and advance human liberty globally. It is arrogance to think that technology will save us.
It is ego to think that we can continue this unjust and extractive approach to living on
this planet and survive.

To survive this next phase of our human existence, we will need to restructure our social
and economic systems to develop our collective resilience. The social restructuring must
be towards restoration and repair of the earth and the communities that have been
extracted from, criminalized and targeted for generations. These are the frontlines. This
is where we start. We must establish a new social attitude to see migration as a benefit, a
necessity for our global survival, not as a threat to our individual privilege. Collective
resilience means developing cities that can receive people and provide housing, food,
water, health care and the freedom from overpolicing for everyone, no matter who they are,
no matter where they're from. What would it mean if we started to plan for climate
migration now? Sprawling cities or declining cities could see this as an opportunity to
rebuild a social infrastructure rooted in justice and fairness.

We could actually put money into public hospitals and help them prepare for what is to
come through climate migration, including the trauma that comes with loss and relocation.
We can invest more of our time in justice, but it cannot be for temporary gain, it cannot
be to help budget shortfalls, it has to be for long-term change and it has to be to
advance justice. It's already possible, y'all. After Hurricane Katrina, universities and
high schools around the US took in students to help them finish their semester or their
year without missing a beat. Those students are now productive assets in our community,
and this is what our communities, our businesses and our institutions need to get ready
for now. The time is now. So as we reframe the problem in a more truthful way and we
restructure our social systems in a more just way, all that will be left is for us to
reindigenize ourselves and to conjure a power of the most ancient kind.

This necessarily means that we must learn to follow — not tokenize, not exotify, not
dismiss — the leadership and the traditional knowledge of a particular local place. It
means that we must commit to standards of ecological equity and climate justice and human
rights as the basis, a base standard, a starting point, for where our new society is to
go. All of this requires us to recognize a power greater than ourselves and a life longer
than the ones we will live. It requires us to believe in the things that we are privileged
enough not to have to see. We must honor the rights of nature. We must advance human
rights for all. We must transform from a disposable, individual society into one that sees
our collective, long-term humanity, or else we will not make it. We must see that even the
best of us are entangled in an unjust system, and we must acknowledge that the only way
you're going to survive is for us to figure out how to reach a shared liberation
together. The good news is we come from powerful people.

We come from those who have, in one way or another, survived so far to be us here today.
This is reason enough to fight. And take it from your south Louisiana friend, those
hardest fights are the ones to celebrate. Let's choose to make this next phase of our
planetary existence beautiful, and while we're at it, let's make it just and fair for
everyone. We can do this, y'all. We can do this, because we must. We must, or else we lose
our planet and we lose ourselves. The work starts here. The work starts together. This is
my offering. Thank you for receiving it. Merci.
