(Banjo plays)(Banjo and guitar play)

Is this what it's like to be alive? I reached the point of no returnand I don't know if
I've been burnedfrom the burned bridges in my life, thinkin' you were wrong and I was
right. Maybe I messed up,either way it's too late for us.'Cause baby I'm old with
regret,wishin' I could hold you and just forget. Since I can't I'll just be home but
homesick,wishin' you were mine and I didn't hurt you like I did. Can't go back to when we
had a chance,wishin' I could have a shot at real romance. Now I realize all the things I
could have had were in your cold hands. I'm a fool for a dead romance. Gone, gone, gone. I'm
a fool for a dead romance. Gone, gone, gone. I'm a fool for a dead romance. Is this what it's
like to fantasizeabout a love that never was alive outside my mind or distance? With time I
clearly lost my sight,thinkin' I was wrong to ever leave your side. But time's the harshest
judge,makes us think we were in love. And now I'm old with regret,wishin' I could hold you
and just forget. Since I can't I'll just be home but homesick,wishin' you were mine and I
didn't hurt you like I did. Can't go back to when we had a chance,wishin' I could have a
shot at real romance. Now I realize all the things I could have had were in your cold
hands. I'm a fool for a dead romance. Gone, gone, gone. I'm a fool for a dead romance.(Banjo
