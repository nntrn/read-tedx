In the middle of the 16th century, a talented young anatomist named Andreas Vesalius made
a shocking discovery: the most famous human anatomy texts in the world were wrong. They
not only failed to account for many details of the human body, they also described the
organs of apes and other mammals. While Vesalius knew he was right, announcing these
errors would mean challenging Galen of Pergamon– the most renowned physician in medical
history. But who was this towering figure? And why did doctors working more than 1,300
years later so revere and fear him? Born in 129 CE, Galen left home as a teen to scour the
Mediterranean for medical wisdom. He returned home a gifted surgeon with a passion for
anatomy and a penchant for showmanship. He gleefully entered public anatomy contests,
eager to show up his fellow physicians. In one demonstration, he caused a pig to lose its
voice by tying off one of its nerves. In another, he disemboweled a monkey and challenged
his colleagues to repair it.

When they couldn’t, he did. These grizzly feats won him a position as surgeon to the
city’s gladiators. Eventually, he would leave the arena to become the personal physician
to four Roman Emperors. While his peers debated symptoms and their origins, Galen
obsessively studied anatomy. He was convinced that each organ had a specific function.
Since the Roman government largely prohibited working with human cadavers, Galen
conducted countless dissections of animals instead. Even with this constraint, his
exhaustive investigations yielded some remarkably accurate conclusions. One of Galen’s
most important contributions was the insight that the brain, not the heart, controlled
the body. He confirmed this theory by opening the cranium of a living cow. By applying
pressure to different parts of the brain, he could link various regions to specific
functions. Other experiments allowed him to distinguish sensory from motor nerves,
establish that urine was made in the kidneys, and deduce that respiration was controlled
by muscles and nerves. But these wild experiments also produced extraordinary
misconceptions.

Galen never realized that blood cycles continuously throughout the body. Instead, he
believed the liver constantly produces an endless supply of blood, which gets entirely
depleted on its one-way trip to the organs. Galen is also credited with solidifying the
popular theory of the Four Humours. Introduced by Hippocrates centuries earlier, this
misguided hypothesis attributed most medical problems to an imbalance in four bodily
fluids called humours. To correct the balance of these fluids, doctors employed
dangerous treatments like bloodletting and purging. Informed by his poor understanding of
the circulatory system, Galen was a strong proponent of these treatments, despite their
sometimes lethal consequences. Unfortunately, Galen’s ego drove him to believe that all
his discoveries were of the utmost importance. He penned treatises on everything from
anatomy to nutrition to bedside manner, meticulously cataloguing his writings to ensure
their preservation.

Over the next 13 centuries, Galen’s prolific collection dominated all other schools of
medical thought. His texts became the standard works taught to new generations of
doctors, who in turn, wrote new essays extolling Galen’s ideas. Even doctors who actually
dissected human cadavers would bafflingly repeat Galen’s mistakes, despite seeing clear
evidence to the contrary. Meanwhile, the few practitioners bold enough to offer
conflicting opinions were either ignored or ridiculed. For 1,300 years, Galen’s legacy 
remained untouchable– until renaissance anatomist Vesalius spoke out against him. As a
prominent scientist and lecturer, his authority influenced many young doctors of his
time. But even then, it took another hundred years for an accurate description of blood
flow to emerge, and two hundred more for the theory of the Four Humours to fade.
Hopefully, today we can reap the benefits of Galen’s experiments without attributing equal
credence to his less accurate ideas.

But perhaps just as valuable is the reminder that science is an ever-evolving process,
which should always place evidence above ego.
