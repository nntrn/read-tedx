title: Is there a center of the universe?
speaker: Marjee Chmiel and Trevor Owens
description: >-
 It's been a long road to the discovery that Earth is not the center of the Solar
 System, the Milky Way, or the universe; great thinkers from Aristotle to Bruno
 have grappled with it for millennia. But if we aren't at the center of the
 universe, what is? Marjee Chmiel and Trevor Owens discuss where we stand in the
 (very) big scheme of things. [Directed by Qa'ed Mai, narrated by Michelle
 Snow].

What is at the center of the universe? It's an essential question that humans have been
wondering about for centuries. But the journey toward an answer has been a strange one. If
you wanted to know the answer to this question in third century B.C.E. Greece, you might
look up at the night sky and trust what you see. That's what Aristotle, THE guy to ask
back then, did. He thought that since we're on Earth, looking up, it must be the center,
right? For him, the sphere of the world was made up of four elements: Earth, water, air,
and fire. These elements shifted around a nested set of solid crystalline spheres. Each of
the wandering stars, the planets, had their own crystal sphere. The rest of the universe
and all of its stars were on the last crystal sphere. If you watch the sky change over
time, you could see that this idea worked fine at explaining the motion you saw. For
centuries, this was central to how Europe and the Islamic world saw the
universe.

But in 1543, a guy named Copernicus proposed a different model. He believed that the sun
was at the center of the universe. This radically new idea was hard for a lot of people to
accept. After all, Aristotle's ideas made sense with what they could see, and they were
pretty flattering to humans. But a series of subsequent discoveries made the sun-centric
model hard to ignore. First, Johannes Kepler pointed out that orbits aren't perfect
circles or spheres. Then, Galileo's telescope caught Jupiter's moons orbiting around
Jupiter, totally ignoring Earth. And then, Newton proposed the theory of universal
gravitation, demonstrating that all objects are pulling on each other. Eventually, we had
to let go of the idea that we were at the center of the universe. Shortly after
Copernicus, in the 1580s, an Italian friar, Giordano Bruno, suggested the stars were suns
that likely had their own planets and that the universe was infinite. This idea didn't go
over well.

Bruno was burned at the stake for his radical suggestion. Centuries later, the philosopher
Rene Descartes proposed that the universe was a series of whirlpools, which he called
vortices, and that each star was at the center of a whirlpool. In time, we realized there
were far more stars than Aristotle ever dreamed. As astronomers like William Herschel got
more and more advanced telescopes, it became clear that our sun is actually one of many
stars inside the Milky Way. And those smudges we see in the night sky? They're other
galaxies, just as vast as our Milky Way home. Maybe we're farther from the center than we
ever realized. In the 1920s, astronomers studying the nebuli wanted to figure out how they
were moving. Based on the Doppler Effect, they expected to see blue shift for objects
moving toward us, and red shift for ones moving away. But all they saw was a red shift.
Everything was moving away from us, fast.

This observation is one of the pieces of evidence for what we now call the Big Bang
Theory. According to this theory, all matter in the universe was once a singular,
infinitely dense particle. In a sense, our piece of the universe was once at the center.
But this theory eliminates the whole idea of a center since there can't be a center to an
infinite universe. The Big Bang wasn't just an explosion in space; it was an explosion of
space. What each new discovery proves is that while our observations are limited, our
ability to speculate and dream of what's out there isn't. What we think we know today can
change tomorrow. As with many of the thinkers we just met, sometimes our wildest guesses
lead to wonderful and humbling answers and propel us toward even more perplexing
questions.
