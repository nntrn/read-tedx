title: Myths and misconceptions about evolution
speaker: Alex Gendler
description: >-
 How does evolution really work? Actually, not how some of our common evolutionary
 metaphors would have us believe. For instance, it's species, not individual
 organisms, that adapt to produce evolution, and genes don't "want" to be passed
 on -- a gene can't want anything at all! Alex Gendler sets the record straight on
 the finer points of evolution. [Directed by Giant Animation Studios, narrated by
 Julianna Zarzycki].

Myths and misconceptions about evolution. Let's talk about evolution. You've probably
heard that some people consider it controversial, even though most scientists don't. But
even if you aren't one of those people and you think you have a pretty good understanding
of evolution, chances are you still believe some things about it that aren't entirely
right, things like, "Evolution is organisms adapting to their environment." This was an
earlier, now discredited, theory of evolution. Almost 60 years before Darwin published his
book, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that creatures evolve by developing certain traits
over their lifetimes and then passing those on to their offspring. For example, he thought
that because giraffes spent their lives stretching to reach leaves on higher branches,
their children would be born with longer necks. But we know now that's not how genetic
inheritance works. In fact, individual organisms don't evolve at all.

Instead, random genetic mutations cause some giraffes to be born with longer necks, and
that gives them a better chance to survive than the ones who weren't so lucky, which
brings us to "survival of the fittest". This makes it sound like evolution always favors
the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures, which is not really the case. For one thing,
evolutionary fitness is just a matter of how well-suited they are to their current
environment. If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left, all
those long-necked giraffes would be at a disadvantage. Secondly, survival is not how
evolution occurs, reproduction is. And the world if full of creatures like the male
anglerfish, which is so small and ill-suited for survival at birth that it has to quickly
find a mate before it dies. But at least we can say that if an organism dies without
reproducing, it's evolutionarily useless, right?

Wrong! Remember, natural selection happens not at the organism level, but at the genetic
level, and the same gene that exists in one organism will also exist in its relatives. So,
a gene that makes an animal altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival and
future reproduction of its siblings or cousins, can become more widespread than one that
is solely concerned with self-preservation. Anything that lets more copies of the gene
pass on to the next generation will serve its purpose, except evolutionary purpose. One of
the most difficult things to keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like,
"Genes want to make more copies of themselves," or even, "natural selection," we're
actually using metaphors. A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no outside mechanism
that selects which genes are best to preserve. All that happens is that random genetic
mutations cause the organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different
ways.

Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so
forth. Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form. It's not
ideal for the human eye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the retina, but
that's how it developed, starting from a simple photoreceptor cell. In retrospect, it
would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrients and vitamins rather
than just calories. But over the millenia,during which our ancestors evolved, calories
were scarce, and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly.
So, evolution proceeds blindly, step by step by step, creating all of the diversity we see
in the natural world.
