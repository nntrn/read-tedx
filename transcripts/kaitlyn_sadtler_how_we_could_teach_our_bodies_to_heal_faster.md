title: How we could teach our bodies to heal faster
speaker: Kaitlyn Sadtler
description: >-
 What if we could help our bodies heal faster and without scars, like Wolverine in
 X-Men? TED Fellow Kaitlyn Sadtler is working to make this dream a reality by
 developing new biomaterials that could change how our immune system responds to
 injuries. In this quick talk, she shows the different ways these products could
 help the body regenerate.

What if you could take a pill or a vaccine and, just like getting over a cold, you could
heal your wounds faster? Today, if we have an operation or an accident, we're in the
hospital for weeks, and often left with scars and painful side effects of our inability to
regenerate or regrow healthy, uninjured organs. I work to create materials that instruct
our immune system to give us the signals to grow new tissues. Just like vaccines instruct
our body to fight disease, we could instead instruct our immune system to build tissues
and more quickly heal wounds. Now, regrowing body parts out of nowhere might seem like
magic, but there are several organisms that can achieve this feat. Some lizards can regrow
their tails, the humble salamander can completely regenerate their arm, and even us mere
humans can regrow our liver after losing more than half of its original mass. To make this
magic a bit closer to reality, I'm investigating how our body can heal wounds and build
tissue through instructions from the immune system.

From a scrape on your knee to that annoying sinus infection, our immune system defends our
body from danger. I'm an immunologist, and by using what I know about our body's defense
system, I was able to identify key players in our fight to build back our cuts and
bruises. When looking at materials that are currently being tested for their abilities to
help regrow muscle, our team noticed that after treating an injured muscle with these
materials, there was a large number of immune cells in that material and the surrounding
muscle. So in this case, instead of the immune cells rushing off towards infection to
fight bacteria, they're rushing toward an injury. I discovered a specific type of immune
cell, the helper T cell, was present inside that material that I implanted and absolutely
critical for wound healing. Now, just like when you were a kid and you'd break your pencil
and try and tape it back together again, we can heal, but it might not be in the most
functional way, and we'll get a scar.

So if we don't have these helper T cells, instead of healthy muscle, our muscle develops
fat cells inside of it, and if there's fat in our muscle, it isn't as strong. Now, using
our immune system, our body could grow back without these scars and look like what it was
before we were even injured. I'm working to create materials that give us the signals to
build new tissue by changing the immune response. We know that any time a material is
implanted in our body, the immune system will respond to it. This ranges from pacemakers
to insulin pumps to the materials that engineers are using to try and build new tissue. So
when I place that material, or scaffold, in the body, the immune system creates a small
environment of cells and proteins that can change the way that our stem cells behave. Now,
just like the weather affects our daily activities, like going for a run or staying inside
and binge-watching an entire TV show on Netflix, the immune environment of a scaffold
affects the way that our stem cells grow and develop.

If we have the wrong signals, say the Netflix signals, we get fat cells instead of muscle.
These scaffolds are made of a variety of different things, from plastics to naturally
derived materials, nanofibers of varying thicknesses, sponges that are more or less
porous, gels of different stiffnesses. And researchers can even make the materials release
different signals over time. So in other words, we can orchestrate this Broadway show of
cells by giving them the correct stage, cues and props that can be changed for different
tissues, just like a producer would change the set for "Les Mis" versus "Little Shop of
Horrors." I'm combining specific types of signals that mimic how our body responds to
injury to help us regenerate. In the future, we could see a scar-proof band-aid, a
moldable muscle filler or even a wound-healing vaccine. Now, we aren't going to wake up
tomorrow and be able to heal like Wolverine. Probably not next Tuesday,
either.

But with these advances, and working with our immune system to help build tissue and heal
wounds, we could begin seeing products on the market that work with our body's defense
system to help us regenerate, and maybe one day be able to keep pace with a
salamander. Thank you.
