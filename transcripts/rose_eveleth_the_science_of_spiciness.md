Why does your mouth feel like it's on fire when you eat a spicy pepper? And how do you
soothe the burn? Why does wasabi make your eyes water? And how spicy is the spiciest
spice? Let's back up a bit. First, what is spiciness? Even though we often say that
something tastes spicy, it's not actually a taste, like sweet or salty or sour. Instead,
what's really happening is that certain compounds in spicy foods activate the type of
sensory neurons called polymodal nociceptors. You have these all over your body, including
your mouth and nose, and they're the same receptors that are activated by extreme heat.
So, when you eat a chili pepper, your mouth feels like it's burning because your brain
actually thinks it's burning. The opposite happens when you eat something with menthol in
it. The cool, minty compound is activating your cold receptors. When these heat-sensitive
receptors are activated, your body thinks it's in contact with a dangerous heat source and
reacts accordingly.

This is why you start to sweat, and your heart starts beating faster. The peppers have
elicited the same fight-or-flight response with which your body reacts to most threats.
But you may have noticed that not all spicy foods are spicy in the same way. And the
difference lies in the types of compounds involved. The capsaicin and piperine, found in
black pepper and chili peppers, are made up of larger, heavier molecules called
alkylamides, and those mostly stay in your mouth. Mustard, horseradish, and wasabi are
made up of smaller molecules, called isothiocyanates, that easily float up into your
sinuses. This is why chili peppers burn your mouth, and wasabi burns your nose. The
standard measure of a food's spiciness is its rating on the Scoville scale, which measures
how much its capsaicin content can be diluted before the heat is no longer detectable to
humans. A sweet bell pepper gets 0 Scoville heat units, while Tabasco sauce clocks in
between 1,200-2,400 units.

The race to create the hottest pepper is a constant battle, but two peppers generally come
out on top: The Trinidad Moruga Scorpion and the Carolina Reaper. These peppers measure
between 1.5 and 2 million Scoville heat units, which is about half the units found in
pepper spray. So, why would anyone want to eat something that causes such high levels of
pain? Nobody really knows when or why humans started eating hot peppers. Archaeologists
have found spices like mustard along with human artifacts dating as far back as 23,000
years ago. But they don't know whether the spices were used for food or medication or just
decoration. More recently, a 6,000 year old crockpot, lined with charred fish and meat,
also contained mustard. One theory says that humans starting adding spices to food to kill
off bacteria. And some studies show that spice developed mostly in warmer climates where
microbes also happen to be more prevalent.

But why we continue to subject ourselves to spicy food today is still a bit of a mystery.
For some people, eating spicy food is like riding rollercoasters; they enjoy the ensuing
thrill, even if the immediate sensation is unpleasant. Some studies have even shown that
those who like to eat hot stuff are more likely to enjoy other adrenaline-rich activities,
like gambling. The taste for spicy food may even be genetic. And if you're thinking about
training a bit, to up your tolerance for spice, know this: According to some studies, the
pain doesn't get any better. You just get tougher. In fact, researchers have found that
people who like to eat spicy foods don't rate the burn any less painful than those who
don't. They just seem to like the pain more. So, torment your heat receptors all you want,
but remember, when it comes to spicy food, you're going to get burned.
