title: Lessons in business ... from prison
speaker: Jeff Smith
description: >-
 Jeff Smith spent a year in prison. But what he discovered inside wasn't what he
 expected -- he saw in his fellow inmates boundless ingenuity and business savvy.
 He asks: Why don't we tap this entrepreneurial potential to help ex-prisoners
 contribute to society once they're back outside? (From the TED Talent Search
 event TED@NewYork.)

B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future. He had a vision.
When he got out, he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight, and he was
actually working on merging his two passions into one vision. He'd spent 10,000 dollars to
buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury
sports cars. 

It was my first week in federal prison, and I was learning quickly that it wasn't what you
see on TV. In fact, it was teeming with smart, ambitious men whose business instincts were
in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier
when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate. Now, 95 percent of the guys that I was
locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside, but when they talked about what they
did, they talked about it in a different jargon, but the business concepts that they
talked about weren't unlike those that you'd learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton:
promotional incentives, you never charge a first-time user, focus-grouping new product
launches, territorial expansion. But they didn't spend a lot of time reliving the glory
days. For the most part, everyone was just trying to survive. It's a lot harder than you
might think. Contrary to what most people think, people don't pay, taxpayers don't pay,
for your life when you're in prison.

You've got to pay for your own life. You've got to pay for your soap, your deodorant,
toothbrush, toothpaste, all of it. And it's hard for a couple of reasons. First,
everything's marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you'd pay on the street, and second, you
don't make a lot of money. I unloaded trucks. That was my full-time job, unloading trucks
at a food warehouse, for $5.25, not an hour, but per month. So how do you survive? Well,
you learn to hustle, all kinds of hustles. There's legal hustles. You pay everything in
stamps. Those are the currency. You charge another inmate to clean his cell. There's sort
of illegal hustles, like you run a barbershop out of your cell. There's pretty illegal
hustles: You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell. And there's very illegal hustles,
which you smuggle in, you get smuggled in, drugs, pornography, cell phones, and just as in
the outer world, there's a risk-reward tradeoff, so the riskier the enterprise, the more
profitable it can potentially be.

You want a cigarette in prison? Three to five dollars. You want an old-fashioned cell
phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head? Three hundred bucks. You want a
dirty magazine? Well, it can be as much as 1,000 dollars. So as you can probably tell, one
of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity. Whether it was concocting delicious
meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse, sculpting people's hair with toenail
clippers, or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs,
prisoners learn how to make do with less, and many of them want to take this ingenuity
that they've learned to the outside and start restaurants, barber shops, personal training
businesses. But there's no training, nothing to prepare them for that, no rehabilitation at
all in prison, no one to help them write a business plan, figure out a way to translate
the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises, no access to the
Internet, even.

And then, when they come out, most states don't even have a law prohibiting employers from
discriminating against people with a background. So none of us should be surprised that
two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years. Look, I lied to the Feds. I lost
a year of my life from it. But when I came out, I vowed that I was going to do whatever I
could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn't have to waste any
more of their life than they already had. So I hope that you'll think about helping in some
way. The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and
the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons, because if we don't, they're not going
to learn any new skills that's going to help them, and they'll be right back. All they'll
learn on the inside is new hustles. Thank you.
