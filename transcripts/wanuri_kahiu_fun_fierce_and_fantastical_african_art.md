title: Fun, fierce and fantastical African art
speaker: Wanuri Kahiu
description: >-
 We're so used to narratives out of Africa being about war, poverty and devastation,
 says TED Fellow Wanuri Kahiu. Where's the fun? Introducing "AfroBubbleGum" --
 African art that's vibrant, lighthearted and without a political agenda. Rethink
 the value of all that is unserious as Kahiu explains why we need art that
 captures the full range of human experiences to tell the stories of Africa.

So, my mother's a pediatrician, and when I was young, she'd tell the craziest stories that
combined science with her overactive imagination. One of the stories she told was that if
you eat a lot of salt, all of the blood rushes up your legs, through your body, and shoots
out the top of your head, killing you instantly.

She called it "high blood pressure."

This was my first experience with science fiction, and I loved it. So when I started to
write my own science fiction and fantasy, I was surprised that it was considered
un-African. So naturally, I asked, what is African? And this is what I know so far: Africa
is important. Africa is the future. It is, though. And Africa is a serious place where
only serious things happen. So when I present my work somewhere, someone will always ask,
"What's so important about it? How does it deal with real African issues like war,
poverty, devastation or AIDS?" And it doesn't. My work is about Nairobi pop bands that
want to go to space or about seven-foot-tall robots that fall in love. It's nothing
incredibly important. It's just fun, fierce and frivolous, as frivolous as bubble gum â€”
"AfroBubbleGum."So I'm not saying that agenda art isn't important; I'm the chairperson of
a charity that deals with films and theaters that write about HIV and radicalization and
female genital mutilation.

It's vital and important art, but it cannot be the only art that comes out of the
continent. We have to tell more stories that are vibrant. The danger of the single story
is still being realized. And maybe it's because of the funding. A lot of art is still
dependent on developmental aid. So art becomes a tool for agenda. Or maybe it's because
we've only seen one image of ourselves for so long that that's all we know how to create.
Whatever the reason, we need a new way, and AfroBubbleGum is one approach. It's the
advocacy of art for art's sake. It's the advocacy of art that is not policy-driven or
agenda-driven or based on education, just for the sake of imagination: AfroBubbleGum
art. And we can't all be AfroBubbleGumists. We have to judge our work for its potential
poverty porn pitfalls. We have to have tests that are similar to the Bechdel test, and ask
questions like: Are two or more Africans in this piece of fiction healthy?

Are those same Africans financially stable and not in need of saving? Are they having fun
and enjoying life? And if we can answer yes to two or more of these questions, then surely
we're AfroBubbleGumists.

And fun is political, because imagine if we have images of Africans who were vibrant and
loving and thriving and living a beautiful, vibrant life. What would we think of ourselves
then? Would we think that maybe we're worthy of more happiness? Would we think of our
shared humanity through our shared joy? I think of these things when I create. I think of
the people and the places that give me immeasurable joy, and I work to represent them. And
that's why I write stories about futuristic girls that risk everything to save plants or
to race camels or even just to dance, to honor fun, because my world is mostly happy. And I
know happiness is a privilege in this current splintered world where remaining hopeful
requires diligence. But maybe, if you join me in creating, curating and commissioning more
AfroBubbleGum art, there might be hope for a different view of the world, a happy Africa
view where children are strangely traumatized by their mother's dark sense of
humor,

but also they're claiming fun, fierce and frivolous art in the name of all things
unseriously African. Because we're AfroBubbleGumists and there's so many more of us than
you can imagine. Thank you so much.
