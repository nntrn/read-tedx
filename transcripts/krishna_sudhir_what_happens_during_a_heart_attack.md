Approximately 7 million people around the world die from heart attacks every year, and
cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other problems like strokes, is the
world's leading killer. So what causes a heart attack? Like all muscles, the heart needs
oxygen, and during a heart attack, it can't get enough. Fatty deposits, or plaques,
develop on the walls of our coronary arteries. Those are the vessels that supply
oxygenated blood to the heart. These plaques grow as we age, sometimes getting chunky,
hardened, or enflamed. Eventually, the plaques can turn into blockages. If one of the
plaques ruptures or cracks, a blood clot will form around it in minutes, and a partially
closed artery can become completely blocked. Blood flow is cut off to the cardiac muscle
and the oxygen-starved cells start to die within several minutes. This is a myocardial
infarction, or heart attack. Things can rapidly deteriorate in the absence of
treatment.

The injured muscle may not be able to pump blood as well, and its rhythm might be thrown
off. In the worst case scenario, a heart attack can cause sudden death. And how do you
know that someone is having a heart attack? The most common symptom is chest pain caused
by the oxygen-deprived heart muscle. Patients describe it as crushing or vice-like. It
can radiate to the left arm, jaw, back, or abdomen. But it's not always as sudden and
dramatic as it is in the movies. Some people experience nausea or shortness of breath.
Symptoms may be less prominent in women and the elderly. For them, weakness and tiredness
may be the main signal. And surprisingly, in many people, especially those with diabetes,
which affects the nerves that carry pain, a heart attack may be silent. If you think that
someone might be having a heart attack, the most important thing is to respond quickly.
If you have access to emergency medical services, call them. They're the fastest way to
get to a hospital.

Taking aspirin, which thins the blood, and nitroglycerin, which opens up the artery, can
help keep the heart attack from getting worse. In the emergency room, doctors can
diagnose a heart attack. They commonly use an electrocardiogram to measure the heart's 
electrical activity and a blood test to assess heart muscle damage. The patient is then
taken to a high-tech cardiac suite where tests are done to locate the blockages.
Cardiologists can reopen the blocked artery by inflating it with a balloon in a procedure
called an angioplasty. Frequently, they also insert a metal or polymer stent that will
hold the artery open. More extensive blockages might require coronary artery bypass
surgery. Using a piece of vein or artery from another part of the body, heart surgeons can
reroute blood flow around the blockage. These procedures reestablish circulation to the
cardiac muscle, restoring heart function. Heart attack treatment is advancing, but
prevention is vital.

Genetics and lifestyle factors both affect your risk. And the good news is that you can
change your lifestyle. Exercise, a healthy diet, and weight loss all lower the risk of
heart attacks, whether you've had one before or not. Doctors recommend exercising a few
times a week, doing both aerobic activity and strength training. A heart-healthy diet is
low in sugar and saturated fats, which are both linked to heart disease. So what should
you eat? Lots of fiber from vegetables, chicken and fish instead of red meat, whole grains
and nuts like walnuts and almonds all seem to be beneficial. A good diet and exercise plan
can also keep your weight in a healthy range, which will lower your heart attack risk as
well. And of course, medications can also help prevent heart attacks. Doctors often
prescribe low-dose aspirin, for example, particularly for patients who've already had a
heart attack and for those known to be at high risk.

And drugs that help manage risk factors, like high blood pressure, cholesterol, and
diabetes, will make heart attacks less likely, too. Heart attacks may be common, but they
don't have to be inevitable. A healthy diet, avoiding tobacco use, staying fit, and
enjoying plenty of sleep and lots of laughter all go a long way in making sure your body's
most important muscle keeps on beating.
