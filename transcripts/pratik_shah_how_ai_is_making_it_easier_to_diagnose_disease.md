title: How AI is making it easier to diagnose disease
speaker: Pratik Shah
description: >-
 Today's AI algorithms require tens of thousands of expensive medical images to
 detect a patient's disease. What if we could drastically reduce the amount of
 data needed to train an AI, making diagnoses low-cost and more effective? TED
 Fellow Pratik Shah is working on a clever system to do just that. Using an
 unorthodox AI approach, Shah has developed a technology that requires as few as
 50 images to develop a working algorithm -- and can even use photos taken on
 doctors' cell phones to provide a diagnosis. Learn more about how this new way to
 analyze medical information could lead to earlier detection of life-threatening
 illnesses and bring AI-assisted diagnosis to more health care settings worldwide.

Computer algorithms today are performing incredible tasks with high accuracies, at a
massive scale, using human-like intelligence. And this intelligence of computers is often
referred to as AI or artificial intelligence. AI is poised to make an incredible impact on
our lives in the future. Today, however, we still face massive challenges in detecting and
diagnosing several life-threatening illnesses, such as infectious diseases and cancer.
Thousands of patients every year lose their lives due to liver and oral cancer. Our best
way to help these patients is to perform early detection and diagnoses of these diseases.
So how do we detect these diseases today, and can artificial intelligence help? In
patients who, unfortunately, are suspected of these diseases, an expert physician first
orders very expensive medical imaging technologies such as fluorescent imaging, CTs, MRIs,
to be performed. Once those images are collected, another expert physician then diagnoses
those images and talks to the patient.

As you can see, this is a very resource-intensive process, requiring both expert
physicians, expensive medical imaging technologies, and is not considered practical for
the developing world. And in fact, in many industrialized nations, as well. So, can we
solve this problem using artificial intelligence? Today, if I were to use traditional
artificial intelligence architectures to solve this problem, I would require 10,000 — I
repeat, on an order of 10,000 of these very expensive medical images first to be
generated. After that, I would then go to an expert physician, who would then analyze
those images for me. And using those two pieces of information, I can train a standard
deep neural network or a deep learning network to provide patient's diagnosis. Similar to
the first approach, traditional artificial intelligence approaches suffer from the same
problem. Large amounts of data, expert physicians and expert medical imaging
technologies. So, can we invent more scalable, effective and more valuable artificial
intelligence architectures to solve these very important problems facing us
today?

And this is exactly what my group at MIT Media Lab does. We have invented a variety of
unorthodox AI architectures to solve some of the most important challenges facing us today
in medical imaging and clinical trials. In the example I shared with you today, we had two
goals. Our first goal was to reduce the number of images required to train artificial
intelligence algorithms. Our second goal — we were more ambitious, we wanted to reduce the
use of expensive medical imaging technologies to screen patients. So how did we do it? For
our first goal, instead of starting with tens and thousands of these very expensive
medical images, like traditional AI, we started with a single medical image. From this
image, my team and I figured out a very clever way to extract billions of information
packets. These information packets included colors, pixels, geometry and rendering of the
disease on the medical image.

In a sense, we converted one image into billions of training data points, massively
reducing the amount of data needed for training. For our second goal, to reduce the use of
expensive medical imaging technologies to screen patients, we started with a standard,
white light photograph, acquired either from a DSLR camera or a mobile phone, for the
patient. Then remember those billions of information packets? We overlaid those from the
medical image onto this image, creating something that we call a composite image. Much to
our surprise, we only required 50 — I repeat, only 50 — of these composite images to train
our algorithms to high efficiencies. To summarize our approach, instead of using 10,000
very expensive medical images, we can now train the AI algorithms in an unorthodox way,
using only 50 of these high-resolution, but standard photographs, acquired from DSLR
cameras and mobile phones, and provide diagnosis.

More importantly, our algorithms can accept, in the future and even right now, some very
simple, white light photographs from the patient, instead of expensive medical imaging
technologies. I believe that we are poised to enter an era where artificial intelligence is
going to make an incredible impact on our future. And I think that thinking about
traditional AI, which is data-rich but application-poor, we should also continue thinking
about unorthodox artificial intelligence architectures, which can accept small amounts of
data and solve some of the most important problems facing us today, especially in health
care. Thank you very much.
