At the temple of the fisherman, Quexo, the village shaman, looks out over the ocean and
frowns. It’s a still morning– unusually still, and the lack of wind is the latest in a
series of troubling signs. The year is 1400 BCE. Quexo’s village sits in the dusty, 
treeless desert between the towering Andes and Pacific Ocean. The villagers live off the
sea, harvesting reeds, drying them in the sun, and using them to build fishing boats.
Every day in the summer, the men set out on these boats to hunt shark and other fish while
the women harvest shellfish and sea urchins. In winter, storms bring powerful waves,
which cross the vast ocean unobstructed to detonate on these shores. Most years, Quexo’s
village catches more than enough fish. But this year, the winds have died and the fish
have dwindled. Quexo has seen this pattern before: the fish disappear, then the violent
rains arrive, causing flash floods that dissolve mud bricks and wash away
settlements.

He needs to stop the bad weather before the storms come— his only hope is a special
ritual he’s been planning. Quexo spends much less time in the ocean than the other
villagers. He became a shaman after seeing a sign in the sea one morning— like his father
and grandfather before him. This morning, he walks to the nearby sacred mountain as the
sun rises. There, he gathers ceremonial cactus and herbs like “horse tail,”
“stonebreaker," and valerian, along with the mineral hematite. Back in the village, 
everyone is preparing to leave for a religious festival at a large temple inland. The
festival marks the beginning of what is usually the season of abundance, but with the
signs pointing to storms, Quexo isn’t feeling too celebratory. Whole families travel to the
festival, where they camp for a few days. They’ve packed seaweed, carved bones, gourd
bowls, reed mats, and other goods to trade in the market around the temple.

Quexo inspects the goods to make sure everything is of the finest quality. He brings the
herbs he gathered to trade for cinnabar, a mineral that comes from the highlands in the
Andes. He needs cinnabar for his ritual to ward off the storms. Around lunchtime, the
sprawling temple rises out of the desert ahead. People have come from all along the
coast and the foothills. The women handle trade transactions— they’re looking for cotton
and ceramics. Men aren’t usually allowed to do the trading, but shamans are an exception.
Though Quexo is a man, during rituals he becomes half man, half woman, and this ambiguity
makes his role more flexible outside ceremonies too. Quexo can’t find any cinnabar in the
market, so he heads to the main temple, dodging children playing in the plaza. He puts on
his ceremonial garb: red face paint, earrings, and a necklace of shark’s teeth and
vertebrae. Inside, the ceremonies are already underway, and the shamans have drunk the
sacred cactus drink.

Many of them are Quexo’s friends from festivals over the years, but he doesn’t see the
mountain shamans who would have cinnabar. He begins to panic. If the highland shamans
don’t show up, his only option will be to make the long walk into the mountains. It’s a
dangerous journey that takes five days, precious time he doesn’t have to waste. But
perhaps he has no choice. He refuses the sacred cactus and sets off toward the
mountains. As he leaves the settlement behind, he sees a group approaching. He recognizes
them as highlanders by their llamas. He dashes toward their shaman. Barely pausing to say
hello, he offers him hematite, dried seaweed, and empty shells to grind up for lime and
chew with coca leaves. In return, the other shaman gives him the precious cinnabar. With
the key to his ritual in hand, Quexo heads home to the temple of the fisherman in hopes
of turning the tide.
