title: Where does gold come from?
speaker: David Lunney
description: >-
 Did you know that gold is extraterrestrial? Instead of arising from our planet's
 rocky crust, it was actually cooked up in space and is present on Earth because
 of cataclysmic stellar explosions called supernovae. CERN Scientist David Lunney
 outlines the incredible journey of gold from space to Earth. [Directed by Andrew
 Foerster, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Devin Polaski].

In medieval times, alchemists tried to achieve the seemingly impossible. They wanted to
transform lowly lead into gleaming gold. History portrays these people as aged eccentrics,
but if only they'd known that their dreams were actually achievable. Indeed, today we can 
manufacture gold on Earth thanks to modern inventions that those medieval alchemists
missed by a few centuries. But to understand how this precious metal became embedded in
our planet to start with, we have to gaze upwards at the stars. Gold is extraterrestrial.
Instead of arising from the planet's rocky crust, it was actually cooked up in space and
is present on Earth because of cataclysmic stellar explosions called supernovae. Stars
are mostly made up of hydrogen, the simplest and lightest element. The enormous
gravitational pressure of so much material compresses and triggers nuclear fusion in the
star's core. This process releases energy from the hydrogen, making the star
shine.

Over many millions of years, fusion transforms hydrogen into heavier elements: helium,
carbon, and oxygen, burning subsequent elements faster and faster to reach iron and
nickel. However, at that point nuclear fusion no longer releases enough energy, and the
pressure from the core peters out. The outer layers collapse into the center, and bouncing
back from this sudden injection of energy, the star explodes forming a supernova. The
extreme pressure of a collapsing star is so high, that subatomic protons and electrons are
forced together in the core, forming neutrons. Neutrons have no repelling electric charge
so they're easily captured by the iron group elements. Multiple neutron captures enable
the formation of heavier elements that a star under normal circumstances can't form, from
silver to gold, past lead and on to uranium. In extreme contrast to the million year
transformation of hydrogen to helium, the creation of the heaviest elements in a
supernova takes place in only seconds.

But what becomes of the gold after the explosion? The expanding supernova shockwave
propels its elemental debris through the interstellar medium, triggering a swirling dance 
of gas and dust that condenses into new stars and planets. Earth's gold was likely
delivered this way before being kneaded into veins by geothermal activity. Billions of
years later, we now extract this precious product by mining it, an expensive process
that's compounded by gold's rarity. In fact, all of the gold that we've mined in history
could be piled into just three Olympic-size swimming pools, although this represents a
lot of mass because gold is about 20 times denser than water. So, can we produce more of
this coveted commodity? Actually, yes. Using particle accelerators, we can mimic the
complex nuclear reactions that create gold in stars. But these machines can only construct
gold atom by atom. So it would take almost the age of the universe to produce one gram at
a cost vastly exceeding the current value of gold.

So that's not a very good solution. But if we were to reach a hypothetical point where
we'd mined all of the Earth's buried gold, there are other places we could look. The
ocean holds an estimated 20 million tons of dissolved gold but at extremely miniscule
concentrations making its recovery too costly at present. Perhaps one day, we'll see gold
rushes to tap the mineral wealth of the other planets of our solar system. And who knows?
Maybe some future supernova will occur close enough to shower us with its treasure and
hopefully not eradicate all life on Earth in the process.
