speaker: Tom Nash
description: >-
 In this deeply charming and humorous talk, DJ and self-professed pirate Tom Nash
 meditates on how facing adversity due to disability invited patience, ambition
 and pragmatism into his life in enlightening, unexpected ways. "We all have
 unique weaknesses," he says. "If we're honest about what they are, we can learn
 how to best take advantage of them."

Often when I'm out in public, a child will stare at me. And if the child is particularly
brave, they'll approach me and ask: "Are you a pirate?"

To which I then need to respond, once again, "Yes."

I mean, let's be honest: I've got two hooks, prosthetic legs and a penchant for hard
liquor.

All I need is an eye-patch and a parrot, and I'm basically there.

But I like being a pirate. I find many advantages to having a disability, and I'm not just
talking about the money I save on gloves ...

or the fantastically legitimate excuse for never having to master chopsticks.

I'm talking about real advantages I feel I've gained, having gone through physical
adversity. When I was 19, I contracted a disease that resulted in the loss of both my arms
at the elbows, both my legs below the knee, and left enough scars on my face to elicit
jealousy in Freddy Krueger.

Now, I may never be able to communicate in sign language, but my increased resilience and
general ability to problem-solve has been heightened by being forced to think laterally to
overcome problems that most people aren't faced with. One of the first lessons that I
learned immediately followed the painful and arduous task of learning how to walk again,
but it went on to pay dividends for the rest of my life. It happened when I attempted to
step up a curb. Now as rudimentary as this action sounds to most of you, stepping up a
curb is somewhat of a challenge for those of us without ankle movement. So I tried
stepping up the curb the way I'd always known how, front on, for days on end, with no
success, until it became obvious that the time and effort I was investing into this
endeavor was clearly disproportionate to the benefit of its outcome.

So, I decided to inspect the problem from a different angle. If I couldn't use an ankle
joint to achieve the range of motion that I required to mount the curb, I would have to
use a different joint, like my hip. So I turned my body perpendicular to the curb and
placed my foot up sideways, and I was able to step up immediately. Within five minutes, no
staircase was safe from my advances.

That very day, I climbed a staircase of three flights, which I was quite impressed with as
well, except I realized that I didn't know how to get back down again.

That was a long weekend.

Now, in my past life as an able-bodied person, I'd been a guitarist. I was alright as a
player, but I'd never really taken it further. I'd never really started a band or played
live all that much. Nonetheless, music was a great passion of mine, and when I lost my
arms, the idea that it may no longer be a part of my life critically challenged my will to
keep living. However, the thought that emerged immediately after being discharged from
hospital was: "If Ray Charles can play the piano while blind as a bat, let's get to work
on a solution for this guitar problem." So, consulting with an engineer, I designed a
slide system that would hook into my left hook, and I devised another pick-holder system
that would clip into my right hook. Now, if this worked, I would be able to play the
guitar open tuned on my lap, like a slide. So after weeks of testing and alterations, I
finally had the accessories back to play the guitar again, and I was right back where I
was before losing my hands — being issued with noise complaints from my neighbors,
obviously.

But this time, I took it further. I started a band with my friends. We wrote songs and
recorded them. We even played gigs to real people. Not as many as this.

But even though it was a just a tiny step, it was a giant leap from what I'd achieved when
I was all in one piece. Now while relearning every action that one has ever cultivated
might seem like a significant undertaking — and believe me, it very much was, in the short
term — it was nonetheless having a positive effect on the way that I approached everything
else in my life. Not only did it transform my ability to problem-solve, but I also felt I
became more pragmatic, less sensitive to hindrances, in some cases, more patient, and
magically transformed people's abilities to offer me their seats on public
transport.

Trivial setbacks began to pale in comparison to challenges I'd previously overcome, and
this allowed me to take a calm and measured approach to these challenges, keeping them in
perspective and often even finding new and improved ways to overcome them. The benefit of
not dwelling on the negative and just getting on with the task at hand became
self-evident. It even encouraged me to pursue some more fulfilling career paths that may
otherwise have been inadvisable. And who would have thought that an appropriate job for me
might involve the meticulous operation of electronic equipment to curate dance music to
people in inaccessible places under the influence of alcohol.

Not I.So in a competitive industry where DJs have been relentlessly honing their craft,
desperate to attain gigs, sending demos to clubs, my best friend and I took a different
approach, and we started our own club night, and we employed ourselves as the
DJs.

Suddenly, we had a headline slot.

Now, when we started that club night, I could not DJ. The first time I ever got behind the
decks was on our opening night, in front of hundreds of people. I'd only just learned
where the play button was.

But, being previously faced with so many ultimatums, one's forced to be astute in adapting
to new situations. That club night went on to become the longest-running weekly club night
in Sydney, and we as DJs went on to play Australia's biggest music festivals. So
eventually, I either learned quickly, or the standards of clubs have gone really
downhill.

Coming close to death can be an educational experience. It's certainly true that one's
priorities receive somewhat of a realignment immediately afterwards. And it's also true
that some of those priorities are met with an increased sense of urgency. But another,
more salient realization that comes to light is the triviality of our own self-importance
and self-consciousness. To truly understand the extent to which your self-consciousness
prohibits you from engaging in opportunities should lead everyone to take risks they
otherwise wouldn't. We're merely a blip on the time line of the universe, right? Act
accordingly. Now the ideas that I'm presenting today were imbued upon me through some
otherwise unfortunate circumstances, granted, but they're lying dormant in the lives of
anyone who's willing to exploit them. If we all understand that we all have unique
weaknesses, and if we're honest about what they are, we can learn how to best take
advantage of them, whether they be mounting a curb or fear of presenting sales reports or
the inability to sufficiently manage one's finances — looking at that guy
—

there lies the ability to learn, to adapt, and even the ability to rewire one's
instinctual response to challenges. Adversity is good, and it has the potential to make you
stronger. And, at the very least, you can scare the hell out of kids if you look like a
pirate. Thanks.(Applause and cheers)
