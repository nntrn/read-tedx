title: How my mom inspired my approach to the cello
speaker: Paul Rucker
description: >-
 Multidisciplinary artist and TED Fellow Paul Rucker has developed his own style
 of cello; he puts chopsticks between his strings, uses the instrument as a drum
 and experiments with electronics like loop pedals. Moving between reflective
 storytelling and performance, Rucker shares his inspiration -- and definitely
 doesn't play the same old Bach.

(Cello music)(Music ends)On the flight here, I was reminded about my mom. I'm a
self-taught cellist, I've never had a lesson. I studied double bass, but I just picked up
the cello and started playing because I love doing it. But my mom was an inspiration to
me. I did not realize she was an inspiration, because she got her music degree through a
mail-order course, the US School of Music. While raising two kids, she received a lesson a
week in the mail, and practiced. And at the end of a couple of years, she put on a
recital. And I'll be 50 this month, and it took me that long to realize that she was that
big of an inspiration. I'm just going to keep â€” yeah, thanks, mom.

She's also one of the most extraordinary people I know, beyond being a wonderful musician.
I want to play a little bit for mom and your moms as well, actually.(Cello music)(Music
ends)You know, when you normally hear a cello, you think of this.(Plays Bach Cello Suite
No.1)We're not going to do that today.(Laughter and applause)

Hey!(Looped samples of onstage sounds)(Cello music and looped samples)(Music
ends)(Applause and cheers)
