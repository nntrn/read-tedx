speaker: Lee Mokobe
description: >-
 "I was the mystery of an anatomy, a question asked but not answered," says poet

The first time I uttered a prayer was in a glass-stained cathedral. I was kneeling long
after the congregation was on its feet,dip both hands into holy water,trace the trinity
across my chest,my tiny body drooping like a question markall over the wooden pew. I asked
Jesus to fix me,and when he did not answerI befriended silence in the hopes that my sin
would burnand salve my mouth would dissolve like sugar on tongue,but shame lingered as an
aftertaste. And in an attempt to reintroduce me to sanctity,my mother told me of the
miracle I was,said I could grow up to be anything I want. I decided to be a boy. It was
cute. I had snapback, toothless grin,used skinned knees as street cred,played hide and seek
with what was left of my goal. I was it. The winner to a game the other kids couldn't
play,I was the mystery of an anatomy,a question asked but not answered,tightroping between
awkward boy and apologetic girl,and when I turned 12, the boy phase wasn't deemed cute
anymore. It was met with nostalgic aunts who missed seeing my knees in the shadow of
skirts,who reminded me that my kind of attitude would never bring a husband home,that I
exist for heterosexual marriage and child-bearing. And I swallowed their insults along with
their slurs. Naturally, I did not come out of the closet. The kids at my school opened it
without my permission. Called me by a name I did not recognize,said "lesbian,"but I was
more boy than girl, more Ken than Barbie. It had nothing to do with hating my body,I just
love it enough to let it go,I treat it like a house,and when your house is falling
apart,you do not evacuate,you make it comfortable enough to house all your insides,you
make it pretty enough to invite guests over,you make the floorboards strong enough to
stand on. My mother fears I have named myself after fading things. As she counts the echoes
left behind by Mya Hall, Leelah Alcorn, Blake Brockington. She fears that I'll die without
a whisper,that I'll turn into "what a shame" conversations at the bus stop. She claims I
have turned myself into a mausoleum,that I am a walking casket,news headlines have turned
my identity into a spectacle,Bruce Jenner on everyone's lips while the brutality of living
in this bodybecomes an asterisk at the bottom of equality pages. No one ever thinks of us
as humanbecause we are more ghost than flesh,because people fear that my gender expression
is a trick,that it exists to be perverse,that it ensnares them without their consent,that
my body is a feast for their eyes and handsand once they have fed off my queer,they'll
regurgitate all the parts they did not like. They'll put me back into the closet, hang me
with all the other skeletons. I will be the best attraction. Can you see how easy it is to
talk people into coffins,to misspell their names on gravestones. And people still wonder
why there are boys rotting,they go away in high school hallwaysthey are afraid of becoming
another hashtag in a secondafraid of classroom discussions becoming like judgment dayand
now oncoming traffic is embracing more transgender children than parents. I wonder how long
it will bebefore the trans suicide notes start to feel redundant,before we realize that
our bodies become lessons about sinway before we learn how to love them. Like God didn't
save all this breath and mercy,like my blood is not the wine that washed over Jesus'
feet. My prayers are now getting stuck in my throat. Maybe I am finally fixed,maybe I just
don't care,maybe God finally listened to my prayers. Thank you.
