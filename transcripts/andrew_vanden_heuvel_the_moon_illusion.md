 Have you noticed how the full moon looks bigger on the horizon than high
 overhead? Actually, the two images are exactly the same size -- so why do we
 perceive them differently? Scientists aren't sure, but there are plenty of
 intriguing theories. Andrew Vanden Heuvel unravels the details of focus, distance
 and proportion that contribute to this mystifying optical illusion. [Directed by

Have you ever noticed how the full moon looks bigger when it's near the horizon than when
it's high over head? If so, you're not alone. People have wondered about this strange
effect since ancient times, and surprisingly, we still don't have a great explanation, but
that's not for lack of trying. Some of the greatest minds in history - Aristotle, Ptolemy,
Da Vinci, Decartes - have all wrestled with this problem and failed to generate an
adequate explanation. One of the first ideas suggested was that the image of the moon in
the sky really is bigger near the horizon. Perhaps the Earth's atmosphere acts like a
giant lens, magnifying the moon as it rises and sets. But this explanation doesn't cut it.
If anything, the refraction of the atmosphere would make the moon look slightly smaller.
Plus, if you actually measure the size of the visible moon at different positions, it
doesn't change at all. But then, why does it still seem bigger when it's
rising?

This must be some kind of optical illusion. The question is, which one? One explanation is
the Ebbinghaus Illusion, where two identical objects look different because of the
relative size of the objects they're surrounded by. Here the two center circles are
actually the same size. Maybe the moon looks bigger near the horizon because it's next to
tiny trees, houses, and towers in the distance. But when the moon is higher up, it's
surrounded by the vast darkness of the night sky and looks tiny by comparison. Another
possibility is the famous Ponzo Illusion. If you've ever tried to draw in perspective, you
know that the closer something is to the horizon, the smaller you should draw it. Our
brain compensates automatically for this by perceiving objects near the horizon as larger
than they actually appear. The two yellow lines in this drawing are the same size, but the
upper one seems bigger because we interpret it as receding farther into the
horizon.

So, between Ponzo and Ebbinghaus, it seems like we've solved the mystery of the moon
illusion, but, unfortunately, there are a few details that complicate things. For one
thing, if this was just the Ebbinghaus effect, then we would expect the moon illusion to
disappear for pilots flying high above the clouds since there wouldn't be any other
smaller objects near the horizon. But in fact, pilots and sailors out on the ocean still
claim to see the moon illusion. On the other hand, if it's just our brain's autocorrecting
the size of objects near the horizon, then we'd expect the moon illusion to be visible
inside a planetarium, where the whole sky, including the horizon, is displayed on a
spherical dome overhead. Studies have shown, though, that this is not the case. To make
matters worse, it seems the moon illusion disappears entirely if you just bend over and
look at the moon between your legs.

Now, this is just getting ridiculous! One of the most promising explanations today is
known as Convergence Micropsia. Our brains judge the distance to objects and their
apparent size by the focus of our eyes. When looking at the horizon, your eyes focus far
off into the distance so your brain knows you're looking far away. The moon appears a
certain size. Your brain thinks it's far away, which it is, so you naturally conclude the
moon must be big. But when looking up at the night sky, there's nothing for your eyes to
focus on, so they default to their rest focus, which is a point just a few meters away.
Now your brain thinks the moon is much closer than it really is, so you naturally conclude
the moon's not as big as you thought it was. Rather than explain why the moon looks so big
near the horizon, Convergence Microspia explains why the moon looks so small when
overhead. Still not satisfied?

Well, frankly, neither are many scientists, so the debate over the moon illusion still
rages on and may continue as long as we still see it in the night sky.
