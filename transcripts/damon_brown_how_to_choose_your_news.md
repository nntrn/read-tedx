How do you know what's happening in your world? The amount of information just a click
away may be limitless, but the time and energy we have to absorb and evaluate it is not.
All the information in the world won't be very useful unless you know how to read the
news. To your grandparents, parents, or even older siblings, this idea would have sounded
strange. Only a few decades ago, news was broad-based. Your choices were limited to a
couple of general interest magazines and newspaper of record, and three or four TV
networks where trusted newscasters delivered the day's news at the same reliable time
every evening. But the problems with this system soon became apparent as mass media
spread. While it was known that authoritarian countries controlled and censored
information, a series of scandals showed that democratic governments were also misleading
the public, often with media cooperation.

Revelations of covert wars, secret assassinations, and political corruption undermined
public faith in official narratives presented by mainstream sources. This breakdown of
trust in media gatekeepers lead to alternative newspapers, radio shows, and cable news
competing with the major outlets and covering events from various perspectives. More
recently, the Internet has multiplied the amount of information and viewpoints, with
social media, blogs, and online video turning every citizen into a potential reporter. But
if everyone is a reporter, nobody is, and different sources may disagree, not only
opinions, but on the facts themselves. So how do you get the truth, or something close?
One of the best ways is to get the original news unfiltered by middlemen. Instead of
articles interpreting a scientific study or a politician's speech, you can often find the
actual material and judge for yourself. For current events, follow reporters on social
media.

During major events, such as the Arab Spring or the Ukrainian protests, newscasters and
bloggers have posted updates and recordings from the midst of the chaos. Though many of
these later appear in articles or broadcasts, keep in mind that these polished versions
often combine the voice of the person who was there with the input of editors who weren't.
At the same time, the more chaotic the story, the less you should try to follow it in real
time. In events like terrorist attacks and natural disasters, today's media attempts
continuous coverage even when no reliable new information is available, sometimes leading
to incorrect information or false accusations of innocent people. It's easy to be anxious
in such events, but try checking for the latest information at several points in the day,
rather than every few minutes, allowing time for complete details to emerge and false
reports to be refuted. While good journalism aims for objectivity, media bias is often
unavoidable.

When you can't get the direct story, read coverage in multiple outlets which employ
different reporters and interview different experts. Tuning in to various sources and
noting the differences lets you put the pieces together for a more complete picture. It's
also crucial to separate fact from opinion. Words like think, likely, or probably mean
that the outlet is being careful or, worse, taking a guess. And watch out for reports that
rely on anonymous sources. These could be people who have little connection to the story,
or have an interest in influencing coverage, their anonymity making them unaccountable for
the information they provide. Finally, and most importantly, try to verify news before
spreading it. While social media has enabled the truth to reach us faster, it's also
allowed rumors to spread before they can be verified and falsehoods to survive long after
they've been refuted.

So, before you share that unbelievable or outrageous news item, do a web search to find
any additional information or context you might have missed and what others are saying
about it. Today, we are more free than ever from the old media gatekeepers who used to
control the flow of information. But with freedom comes responsibility: the responsibility
to curate our own experience and ensure that this flow does not become a flood, leaving us
less informed than before we took the plunge.
