title: Watch me fold origami (blindfolded)
speaker: Bruno Bowden + Rufus Cappadocia
description: >-
 After Robert Lang's talk on origami at TED2008, Bruno Bowden stepped onstage with
 a challenge -- he would fold one of Lang's astonishingly complicated origami
 figures, blindfolded, in under 2 minutes. He's accompanied by the cellist Rufus
 Cappadocia.

Hello everyone. And so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation. And
I'm going to be folding one of Robert Lang's models. And this is the piece of paper it
will be made from, and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it. And Rufus is
going to be doing some improvisation on his custom, five-string electric cello, and it's
very exciting to listen to him. Are you ready to go? OK. Just to make it a little bit
more exciting. All right. Take it away, Rufus. 

All right. There you go.
