"The Road Not Taken" By Robert Frost Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I
could not travel both And be one traveler, long I stood and looked down one as far as I
could To where it bent in the undergrowth; Then took the other, as just as fair, And
having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear; Though as for
that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, And both that morning equally
lay In leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet
knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall be
telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and
Iâ€” I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.
