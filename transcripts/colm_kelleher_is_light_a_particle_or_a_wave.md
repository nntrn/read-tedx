title: Is light a particle or a wave?
speaker: Colm Kelleher
description: >-
 Can we accurately describe light as exclusively a wave or just a particle? Are
 the two mutually exclusive? In this third part of his series on light and color
 Colm Kelleher discusses wave-particle duality and its relationship to how we see
 light and therefore color. [Directed by Nelson Diaz, narrated by Colm Kelleher].

You look down and see a yellow pencil lying on your desk. Your eyes, and then your brain,
are collecting all sorts of information about the pencil: its size, color, shape,
distance, and more. But, how exactly does this happen? The ancient Greeks were the first
to think more or less scientifically about what light is and how vision works. Some Greek
philosophers, including Plato and Pythagoras, thought that light originated in our eyes
and that vision happened when little, invisible probes were sent to gather information
about far-away objects. It took over a thousand years before the Arab scientist, Alhazen,
figured out that the old, Greek theory of light couldn't be right. In Alhazen's picture,
your eyes don't send out invisible, intelligence-gathering probes, they simply collect the
light that falls into them. Alhazen's theory accounts for a fact that the Greek's couldn't
easily explain: why it gets dark sometimes. The idea is that very few objects actually
emit their own light.

The special, light-emitting objects, like the sun or a lightbulb, are known as sources of
light. Most of the things we see, like that pencil on your desk, are simply reflecting
light from a source rather than producing their own. So, when you look at your pencil, the
light that hits your eye actually originated at the sun and has traveled millions of miles
across empty space before bouncing off the pencil and into your eye, which is pretty cool
when you think about it. But, what exactly is the stuff that is emitted from the sun and
how do we see it? Is it a particle, like atoms, or is it a wave, like ripples on the
surface of a pond? Scientists in the modern era would spend a couple of hundred years
figuring out the answer to this question. Isaac Newton was one of the earliest. Newton
believed that light is made up of tiny, atom-like particles, which he called corpuscles.
Using this assumption, he was able to explain some properties of light.

For example, refraction, which is how a beam of light appears to bend as it passes from
air into water. But, in science, even geniuses sometimes get things wrong. In the 19th
century, long after Newton died, scientists did a series of experiments that clearly
showed that light can't be made up of tiny, atom-like particles. For one thing, two beams
of light that cross paths don't interact with each other at all. If light were made of
tiny, solid balls, then you would expect that some of the particles from Beam A would
crash into some of the particles from Beam B. If that happened, the two particles involved
in the collision would bounce off in random directions. But, that doesn't happen. The
beams of light pass right through each other as you can check for yourself with two laser
pointers and some chalk dust. For another thing, light makes interference patterns.
Interference patterns are the complicated undulations that happen when two wave patterns
occupy the same space.

They can be seen when two objects disturb the surface of a still pond, and also when two
point-like sources of light are placed near each other. Only waves make interference
patterns, particles don't. And, as a bonus, understanding that light acts like a wave
leads naturally to an explanation of what color is and why that pencil looks yellow. So,
it's settled then, light is a wave, right? Not so fast! In the 20th century, scientists
did experiments that appear to show light acting like a particle. For instance, when you
shine light on a metal, the light transfers its energy to the atoms in the metal in
discrete packets called quanta. But, we can't just forget about properties like
interference, either. So these quanta of light aren't at all like the tiny, hard spheres
Newton imagined. This result, that light sometimes behaves like a particle and sometimes
behaves like a wave, led to a revolutionary new physics theory called quantum
mechanics.

So, after all that, let's go back to the question, "What is light?" Well, light isn't
really like anything we're used to dealing with in our everyday lives. Sometimes it
behaves like a particle and other times it behaves like a wave, but it isn't exactly like
either.
