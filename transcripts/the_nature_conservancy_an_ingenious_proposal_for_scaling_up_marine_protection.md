title: An ingenious proposal for scaling up marine protection
speaker: The Nature Conservancy
description: >-
 Island and coastal nations need to protect their waters to keep the oceans
 healthy. But they often have lots of debt and aren't able to prioritize ocean
 conservation over other needs. The team at The Nature Conservancy sees a way to
 solve both problems at once: restructuring a nation's debt in exchange for its
 government's commitment to protect coastal areas. Learn more about how "Blue
 Bonds for Conservation" work -- and how you can help unlock billions of dollars
 for the oceans. This ambitious plan is a part of the Audacious Project, TED's
 initiative to inspire and fund global change. (Voiced by Ladan Wise)

Ah, earth's oceans. They are beautiful, inspiring, life-sustaining. They are also, as
you're probably quite aware, more or less screwed. In the Seychelles, for example, human
activities and climate change have left corals bleached. Overfishing has caused fish
stocks to plummet. Biodiversity is in peril. So what can we do? Well, some form of
protection, obviously. Nature is very resilient. When marine areas are strategically
protected, entire ecosystems can bounce back. However, creating marine protected areas
isn't easy. First, you have the issue of figuring out where to protect. This coral reef
overlaps with that international fishing route, intersects with this fish hatchery.
Everything is interconnected. And marine protection plans must take into account how one
area affects another. Then, there's the issue of getting everyone on board. Coastal
economies often rely on fishing and tourism.

If people think they can't do their work, there's no chance of getting the local buy-in
you need for the area to be successful. Marine protected areas must also be enforced. That
means the government itself must be deeply invested in the plan. Token support will not
cut it. And finally, conservation requires money. A lot of it. Governments in island and
coastal nations may want to protect their waters, but often these nations have very high
debt and can't afford to prioritize conservation. If we rely on philanthropic dollars
alone to fund marine protection, we might get a small marine-protected area here, another
little one there. But we need more marine protected areas faster, to have lasting
impact. So what exactly does smart ocean conservation look like? How do we get the money,
government support and careful planning that takes into account both local economies and
complex ecosystems? We want to share with you an audacious idea from The Nature
Conservancy.

It seeks to address all of these things in one fell swoop. They've realized that debt held
by island and coastal nations is the very thing that will enable them to achieve their
conservation goals. TNC's idea is to restructure this debt, to generate the funds and
political will to protect reefs, mangroves and fisheries. For example, if you refinance
your house to take advantage of a better interest rate, maybe you use the savings to
insulate your attic. That's what Blue Bonds for Conservation do for entire coastal
countries. Refinance the debt, then use the savings to create marine protected areas. Of
course, sovereign debt restructuring is more complicated than that, but you get the basic
idea. If investors put in 40 million dollars now, it can unlock as much as 1.6 billion for
ocean conservation. And this is how the work gets done. Step one: negotiate the deal. A
coastal nation commits to protect at least 30 percent of its ocean areas.

In exchange, The Nature Conservancy bring investors, public funders and international
development organizations to the table to restructure a portion of the nation's debt,
leading to lower interest rates and longer repayment periods. Step two: create a marine
plan. Simultaneously, The Nature Conservancy works with marine scientists, government
leaders and local stakeholders to create a detailed conservation plan that integrates the
needs of the ocean with the needs of the people. Step three: activate for longevity. TNC
establishes an independently run conservation trust fund. The savings from the debt
restructure goes into it to support new marine protected areas. The trust then holds the
government accountable for its commitments, ensuring that the Blue Bonds finance real
protection efforts. Could this plan work? It already has. In 2016, TNC helped create a
national conservation plan in the Seychelles. TNC restructured 22 million dollars of the
government's debt.

And in exchange, the government agreed to protect 30 percent of its marine areas. Today,
the Seychelles is on track to protect 400,000 square kilometers of ocean. That's an area
roughly the size of Germany. The Seychelles is protecting its coral reefs, it's
replenishing its fisheries, it's improving its resilience to climate change. At the same
time, it's strengthening its economy. This success is making other governments take note.
Many want to be part of this. There's an opportunity to scale this up, dramatically. And
fast. TNC has identified 20 more nations where such a plan should be possible. But to
execute, they need seed capital. And to put in place local teams who can develop
conservation plans, work with all the stakeholders and structure the deals. If they get
the support they need over the next five years, they could protect four million square
kilometers of ocean. That's 10 Germanies. This would increase the amount of protected areas
in all of the world's oceans by an incredible 15 percent.

It would allow vast tracks of the world's coral reefs to replenish and give safe harbor to
countless species. This would be truly incredible. And it's really just the beginning.
Because there aren't 20 countries in the world where this kind of debt conversion would
work. There are almost 100.With this approach, everyone wins. Governments, local citizens,
funders, and most importantly, our oceans. So in fact, we all win. Ah, earth's oceans.[The
