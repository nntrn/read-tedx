title: A test for Parkinson's with a phone call
speaker: Max Little
description: >-
 Parkinson's disease affects 6.3 million people worldwide, causing weakness and
 tremors, but there's no objective way to detect it early on. Yet. Applied
 mathematician and TED Fellow Max Little is testing a simple, cheap tool that in
 trials is able to detect Parkinson's with 99 percent accuracy -- in a 30-second
 phone call.

So, well, I do applied math, and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied
math, is that we are like management consultants. No one knows what the hell we do. So I
am going to give you some — attempt today to try and explain to you what I do. So, dancing
is one of the most human of activities. We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you
will see later on. Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high
level of skill, and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic
component to it. Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease gradually
destroy this extraordinary ability, as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was a
virtuoso ballet dancer in his time. So great progress and treatment has been made over the
years. However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease, and they have
to live with incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity and the other symptoms that go along
with the disease, so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it's
too late.

We need to be able to measure progression objectively, and ultimately, the only way we're
going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can
answer that for sure. But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease and other movement
disorders, there are no biomarkers, so there's no simple blood test that you can do, and
the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test. You have to go to the
clinic to do it. It's very, very costly, and that means that, outside the clinical trials,
it's just never done. It's never done. But what if patients could do this test at home?
Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic, and what if patients
could do that test themselves, right? No expensive staff time required. Takes about $300,
by the way, in the neurologist's clinic to do it. So what I want to propose to you as an
unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this, because, you see, in one sense, at
least, we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling. So here we have a video of the
vibrating vocal folds.

Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds, and we can think of
ourselves as vocal ballet dancers, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs
when we make sounds, and we all actually have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example. And
like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training. I mean, just think how long it
takes a child to learn to speak. From the sound, we can actually track the vocal fold
position as it vibrates, and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's, so too are the
vocal organs. So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of irregular vocal fold
tremor. We see all the same symptoms. We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity. The
speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while, and that's one of the
example symptoms of it. So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle, in some cases,
but with any digital microphone, and using precision voice analysis software in
combination with the latest in machine learning, which is very advanced by now, we can now
quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice
signals alone. So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against expert clinical
tests?

We'll, they're both non-invasive. The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use
existing infrastructure. You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.
And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition, voice-based tests are non-expert. That
means they can be self-administered. They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most.
They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens. When something becomes ultra-low
cost, it becomes massively scalable. So here are some amazing goals that I think we can
deal with now. We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients. No need to go to the
clinic for a routine checkup. We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data.
We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials, and we can make
population-scale screening feasible for the first time. We have the opportunity to start
to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late. So, taking the
first steps towards this today, we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative.

With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming to record a very large number of voices
worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals. We have local
numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet. Anyone healthy or
with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply, and leave recordings, a few cents each, and I'm
really happy to announce that we've already hit six percent of our target just in eight
hours. Thank you. 

Tom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,let's say, 10,000 people, you'll be
able to tell who's healthy and who's not? What are you going to get out of those
samples? Max Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that, during the call you have to
indicate whether or not you have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right. ML: You see, some
people may not do it. They may not get through it. But we'll get a very large sample of
data that is collected from all different circumstances, and it's getting it in different
circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding
factors, and looking for the actual markers of the disease. TR: So you're 86 percent
accurate right now? ML: It's much better than that. Actually, my student Thanasis, I have
to plug him, because he's done some fantastic work, and now he has proved that it works
over the mobile telephone network as well, which enables this project, and we're getting
99 percent accuracy. TR: Ninety-nine.

Well, that's an improvement. So what that means is that people will be able to — ML:

TR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test, and people
with Parkinson's could call in, record their voice, and then their doctor can check up on
their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease. ML: Absolutely. TR:
Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody. ML: Thanks, Tom.
