title: Can technology solve our big problems?
speaker: Jason Pontin
description: >-
 In 1969, Buzz Aldrin’s historical step onto the moon leapt mankind into an era of
 technological possibility. The awesome power of technology was to be used to
 solve all of our big problems. Fast forward to present day, and what's happened?
 Are mobile apps all we have to show for ourselves? Journalist Jason Pontin looks
 closely at the challenges we face to using technology effectively ... for
 problems that really matter.

So, we used to solve big problems. On July 21st, 1969, Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo
11's lunar module and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility. Armstrong and Aldrin were
alone, but their presence on the moon's gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive,
collective effort. The Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the
history of the United States. To get to the moon, NASA spent around 180 billion dollars in
today's money, or four percent of the federal budget. Apollo employed around 400,000
people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies, universities and government
agencies. People died, including the crew of Apollo 1. But before the Apollo program
ended, 24 men flew to the moon. Twelve walked on its surface, of whom Aldrin, following
the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most senior. So why did they go? They didn't
bring much back: 841 pounds of old rocks, and something all 24 later emphasized — a new
sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home.

Why did they go? The cynical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show
the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets. But Kennedy's own words at Rice
University in 1962 provide a better clue.

John F. Kennedy: But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may
well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does
Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon.

We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do the other things, not because they are
easy, but because they are hard. Jason Pontin: To contemporaries, Apollo wasn't only a
victory of West over East in the Cold War. At the time, the strongest emotion was of
wonder at the transcendent powers of technology. They went because it was a big thing to
do. Landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological
triumphs. The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane,
penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis. In the middle years of the century, polio was
eradicated and smallpox eliminated. Technology itself seemed to possess what Alvin Toffler
in 1970 called "accelerative thrust." For most of human history, we could go no faster
than a horse or a boat with a sail, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 25,000
miles an hour. Since 1970, no human beings have been back to the moon.

No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and blithe optimism about
technology's powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve,
such as going to Mars, creating clean energy, curing cancer, or feeding the world have
come to seem intractably hard. I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17. I was five
years old, and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket. I
vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions, but I was absolutely certain
there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime. So "Something happened to our capacity to
solve big problems with technology" has become a commonplace. You hear it all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED. It feels as if technologists have
diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys, with things like iPhones and apps
and social media, or algorithms that speed automated trading. There's nothing wrong with
most of these things.

They've expanded and enriched our lives. But they don't solve humanity's big problems. What
happened? So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley, which admits that it has
been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed Intel,
Microsoft, Apple and Genentech. Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame, in
particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs. Silicon Valley
says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards
funding incremental problems or even fake problems. But I don't think that explanation is
good enough. It mostly explains what's wrong with Silicon Valley. Even when venture
capitalists were at their most risk-happy, they preferred small investments, tiny
investments that offered an exit within 10 years. V.C.s have always struggled to invest
profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose
development is long and lengthy, and V.C.s have never, never funded the development of
technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial
value.

No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and more
profound. Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems. We could go to Mars if we want.
NASA even has the outline of a plan. But going to Mars would follow a political decision
with popular appeal, and that will never happen. We won't go to Mars, because everyone
thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth. Sometimes, we can't solve big
problems because our political systems fail. Today, less than two percent of the world's
energy consumption derives from advanced, renewable sources such as solar, wind and
biofuels, less than two percent, and the reason is purely economic. Coal and natural gas
are cheaper than solar and wind, and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels. We want
alternative energy sources that can compete on price. None exist. Now, technologists,
business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and
international treaties would spur the development of alternative energy: mostly, a
significant increase in energy research and development, and some kind of price on
carbon.

But there's no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy
or international treaties that reflect that consensus. Sometimes, big problems that had
seemed technological turn out not to be so. Famines were long understood to be caused by
failures in food supply. But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are
political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution. Technology can improve
things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food, but there will be
famines so long as there are bad governments. Finally, big problems sometimes elude
solution because we don't really understand the problem. President Nixon declared war on
cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer, most of them
fiendishly resistant to therapy, and it is only in the last 10 years that effective,
viable therapies have come to seem real. Hard problems are hard. It's not true that we
can't solve big problems through technology.

We can, we must, but these four elements must all be present: Political leaders and the
public must care to solve a problem; institutions must support its solution; It must
really be a technological problem; and we must understand it. The Apollo mission, which has
become a kind of metaphor for technology's capacity to solve big problems, met these
criteria. But it is an irreproducible model for the future. It is not 1961. There is no
galvanizing contest like the Cold War, no politician like John Kennedy who can heroize the
difficult and the dangerous, and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring
the solar system. Most of all, going to the moon turned out to be easy. It was just three
days away. And arguably it wasn't even solving much of a problem. We are left alone with
our day, and the solutions of the future will be harder won. God knows, we don't lack for
the challenges. Thank you very much.
