Someone has tripped the magical alarms in the Element Temple. By the time you and the
other monks arrive on the scene, you know you have a disaster on your hands. Overnight,
four young apprentices broke into the temple’s inner chamber to steal the sacred element
crystals. But when the alarm went off they panicked, and each of them swallowed the
crystal they held right before they were caught. With no idea how to control the
crystals’ vast powers, they’ll soon transform into uncontrollable elemental
spirits. Improbably enough, the old monk next to you has seen something similar happen
before. He explains: “You must determine who ate which crystal and get each into the
proper containment field before they transform. The elements compel their masters: those
who ate the Earth and Water Crystals must speak the truth, while those who consumed Fire
and Air must lie."The youths are too scared to confess their own transgressions.

Instead, they fall to accusing each other.“Rikku took the Water crystal!” Sumi blurts
out. Rikku interrupts angrily. “It was Bella, she stole the Fire crystal!”So Bella yells: 
“Jonah ate the Air crystal, I saw him!”Jonah looks up timidly and shakes his head. “I… I
don’t know what happened, but Sumi doesn’t have the Earth crystal.”So who ate which
crystal? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. There’s no getting around it— this will
take some trial and error. But that’s not a bad thing. If we make a wrong guess, we’ll
eventually reach a point where our conclusions contradict each other. That would allow us
to confirm that our initial guess was wrong and work from there. This is a technique 
known as proof by contradiction. The trick is in being strategic about where we begin our
guessing. Some assumptions might not lead to contradictions without making further
assumptions. We want to pick one that creates the most constraints on its own, and thus
gives us the most information when it turns out to be right or wrong.

Take, for example, Sumi’s statement. If we assume she’s telling the truth, we’d know the
identity of both truth tellers. Rikku would have the Water crystal, and since she’s not
lying about him, Sumi would have Earth. So Bella would have the Fire crystal, as Rikku
says. But then Bella would have to be lying about Jonah having the Air crystal. And yet
that’s the only remaining option. This is a contradiction, and it tells us our initial
assumption was wrong. So now we can go back to the start, but with the added knowledge 
that Sumi is lying. As a liar, Sumi must either have the Fire or Air crystal. That means
Jonah was telling the truth about her, so he can’t have taken either of those. And that
means Bella was lying about him, so she must also have either Fire or Air. Since Sumi was
lying, Rikku can’t have taken the Water crystal— the only one left who could have it is
Jonah. And because we’ve already identified the two liars, Rikku must have the Earth
crystal.

That means Bella has the Fire crystal and Sumi has Air. You manage to get them all in the
proper containment fields just as the crystals’ magic begins to manifest. Compared with
the difficult task of training these kids to control their new powers, figuring out who
had which crystal was elementary.
