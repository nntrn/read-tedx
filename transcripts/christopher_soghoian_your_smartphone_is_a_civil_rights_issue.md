title: Your smartphone is a civil rights issue
speaker: Christopher Soghoian
description: >-
 The smartphone you use reflects more than just personal taste ... it could
 determine how closely you can be tracked, too. Privacy expert and TED Fellow
 Christopher Soghoian details a glaring difference between the encryption used on
 Apple and Android devices and urges us to pay attention to a growing digital
 security divide. "If the only people who can protect themselves from the gaze of
 the government are the rich and powerful, that's a problem," he says. "It's not
 just a cybersecurity problem -- it's a civil rights problem."

In the spring of 2016, a legal battle between Apple and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation captured the world's attention. Apple has built security features into its
mobile products which protect data on its devices from everyone but the owner. That means
that criminals, hackers and yes, even governments are all locked out. For Apple's
customers, this is a great thing. But governments are not so happy. You see, Apple has
made a conscious decision to get out of the surveillance business. Apple has tried to make
surveillance as difficult as possible for governments and any other actors. There are
really two smartphone operating systems in the global smartphone market: iOS and Android.
iOS is made by Apple. Android is made by Google. Apple has spent a lot of time and money
to make sure that its products are as secure as possible. Apple encrypts all data stored
on iPhones by default, and text messages sent from one Apple customer to another Apple
customer are encrypted by default without the user having to take any actions. What this
means is that, if the police seize an iPhone and it has a password, they'll have a
difficult time getting any data off of it, if they can do it at all.

In contrast, the security of Android just really isn't as good. Android phones, or at
least most of the Android phones that have been sold to consumers, do not encrypt data
stored on the device by default, and the built-in text messaging app in Android does not
use encryption. So if the police seize an Android phone, chances are, they'll be able to
get all the data they want off of that device. Two smartphones from two of the biggest
companies in the world; one that protects data by default, and one that doesn't. Apple is a
seller of luxury goods. It dominates the high end of the market. And we would expect a
manufacturer of luxury goods to have products that include more features. But not everyone
can afford an iPhone. That's where Android really, really dominates: at the middle and low
end of the market, smartphones for the billion and a half people who cannot or will not
spend 600 dollars on a phone. But the dominance of Android has led to what I call the
"digital security divide." That is, there is now increasingly a gap between the privacy
and security of the rich, who can afford devices that secure their data by default, and of
the poor, whose devices do very little to protect them by default. So, think of the average
Apple customer: a banker, a lawyer, a doctor, a politician.

These individuals now increasingly have smartphones in their pockets that encrypt their
calls, their text messages, all the data on the device, without them doing really anything
to secure their information. In contrast, the poor and the most vulnerable in our
societies are using devices that leave them completely vulnerable to surveillance. In the
United States, where I live, African-Americans are more likely to be seen as suspicious or
more likely to be profiled, and are more likely to be targeted by the state with
surveillance. But African-Americans are also disproportionately likely to use Android
devices that do nothing at all to protect them from that surveillance. This is a
problem. We must remember that surveillance is a tool. It's a tool used by those in power
against those who have no power. And while I think it's absolutely great that companies
like Apple are making it easy for people to encrypt, if the only people who can protect
themselves from the gaze of the government are the rich and powerful, that's a
problem.

And it's not just a privacy or a cybersecurity problem. It's a civil rights problem. So the
lack of default security in Android is not just a problem for the poor and vulnerable
users who are depending on these devices. This is actually a problem for our democracy.
I'll explain what I mean. Modern social movements rely on technology — from Black Lives
Matter to the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street. The organizers of these movements and the
members of these movements increasingly communicate and coordinate with smartphones. And
so, naturally governments that feel threatened by these movements will also target the
organizers and their smartphones. Now, it's quite possible that a future Martin Luther
King or a Mandela or a Gandhi will have an iPhone and be protected from government
surveillance. But chances are, they'll probably have a cheap, $20 Android phone in their
pocket. And so if we do nothing to address the digital security divide, if we do nothing to
ensure that everyone in our society gets the same benefits of encryption and is equally
able to protect themselves from surveillance by the state, not only will the poor and
vulnerable be exposed to surveillance, but future civil rights movements may be crushed
before they ever reach their full potential. Thank you.

Helen Walters: Chris, thank you so much. I have a question for you. We saw recently in the
press that Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook covers over his camera and does something with
his headphone mic jack. So I wanted to ask you a personal question, which is: Do you do
that? And, on behalf of everyone here, particularly myself, Should we be doing that?
Should we be covering these things? Christopher Soghoian: Putting a sticker — actually, I
like Band-Aids, because you can remove them and put them back on whenever you want to make
a call or a Skype call. Putting a sticker over your web cam is probably the best thing you
can do for your privacy in terms of bang for buck. There really is malware, malicious
software out there that can take over your web cam, even without the light turning on.
This is used by criminals. This is used by stalkers. You can buy $19.99 "spy on your
ex-girlfriend" software online. It's really terrifying. And then, of course, it's used by
governments.

And there's obviously a sexual violence component to this, which is that this kind of
surveillance can be used most effectively against women and other people who can be shamed
in our society. Even if you think you have nothing to hide, at the very least, if you have
children, teenagers in your lives, make sure you put a sticker on their camera and protect
them. HW: Wow. Thank you so much. CS: Thank you. HW: Thanks, Chris.
