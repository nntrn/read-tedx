title: What is verbal irony?
speaker: Christopher Warner
description: >-
 At face value the lines between verbal irony sarcasm and compliments can be
 blurry. After all the phrase 'That looks nice' could be all three depending on
 the circumstances. In the final of a three part series on irony Christopher
 Warner gets into the irony you may use most often and most casually: verbal
 irony. [Directed by Ben Pearce, narrated by Christopher Warner].

Great weather we're having! Awesome job! You're a tremendous athlete! Compliments, right?
Well, maybe. Depending on the attitude and tone of voice behind these lines, they very
well may be compliments. They may also be, though, pointed and attacking lines. This
slight change of attitude behind the lines reveals what we call verbal irony. So when
someone says, "Great weather we're having," it is quite possible that the person really
means that if the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the wind is calm. But if the
weather is horrible, the clouds are looming, and the wind is a raging tempest, and someone
says, "Great weather we're having," he probably doesn't actually mean that. He probably
means that the weather is horrible, but he has said the opposite. This is verbal irony
when the speaker says the opposite of what he means. I know what you're thinking. Isn't
this sarcasm, isn't the speaker being sarcastic? Yes.

When a speaker says the opposite of what he means, that is verbal irony. When a speaker
then goes the step farther to mean the opposite of what he says and seeks to be a little
pointed and mean, like he's making fun of something, then you have sarcasm. Take the
second example: "Awesome job!" Someone accomplishing his life-long dream: awesome! Someone
winning a sports championship: awesome! Someone rear-ends another car: not awesome. So
when the passenger says, "Awesome job!" they probably mean the opposite with a hint of
poking fun. That is verbal irony and that is sarcastic. "You're a talented athlete," said
to an Olympian: authentic, no verbal irony present. Said to the klutzy kid tripping into
English class and spilling his books and pencil case all over the room, now that is just
harsh and verbally ironic because what you said is not what you meant. That is verbal
irony. You have said the opposite of what you mean.

Additionally, since you have the intention of mocking this poor person, you have not only
been verbally ironic, but sarcastic as well. Beware, though. While all sarcasm fits the
definition of verbal irony, not all verbal irony is sarcastic. Verbal irony is where what
is meant is the opposite of what is said, while sarcasm adds that little punch of
attitude. There are times, though, where another layer of meaning can be present without
that sarcastic tone. Alright, now go out there and find those examples of verbal irony and
sarcasm. Good luck! No, seriously, I mean it, good luck. No, no, really, I truly want to
wish you luck on this difficult task. Ok, ok, sincerely good luck. You can do it! No
verbal irony here.
