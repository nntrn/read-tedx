speaker: Beardyman

 Frustrated by not being able to sing two notes at the same time, musical inventor
 Beardyman built a machine to allow him to create loops and layers from just the
 sounds he makes with his voice. Given that he can effortlessly conjure the sound
 of everything from crying babies to buzzing flies, not to mention mimic pretty
 much any musical instrument imaginable, that's a lot of different sounds. Sit
 back and let the wall of sound of this dazzling performance wash over you.

I'd like you all to ask yourselves a question which you may never have asked yourselves
before: What is possible with the human voice? What is possible with the human voice?

♪ Ooh baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Baby crying) ♪ baby ♪ (Cat
meowing) (Dog barking) Yeah. 

(Boomerang noises) It was coming straight for me. I had to. It was, yeah. As you can
probably well imagine, I was a strange child. 

Because the thing is, I was constantly trying to extend my repertoire of noises to be the
very maximum that it could be. I was constantly experimenting with these noises. And I'm
still on that mission. I'm still trying to find every noise that I can possibly make. And
the thing is, I'm a bit older and wiser now, and I know that there's some noises I'll
never be able to make because I'm hemmed in by my physical body, and there's things it
can't do. And there's things that no one's voice can do. For example, no one can do two
notes at the same time. You can do two-tone singing, which monks can do, which is like...
(Two-tone singing) But that's cheating. And it hurts your throat. So there's things you
can't do, and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me, because
beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world, but
they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me.

If only, if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions
which my body gives it. So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine.
We've made a system which is basically a live production machine, a real-time music
production machine, and it enables me to, using nothing but my voice, create music in real
time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might
place on me. And I'm going to show you what it can do. And before I start making noises
with it, and using it to manipulate my voice, I want to reiterate that everything that
you're about to hear is being made by my voice. This system has — thank you, beautiful
assistant — this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so
there's no prerecorded samples of any kind. So once this thing really gets going, and it
really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obvious that it is
the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice
and simple.

So the polyphony problem: I've only got one voice. How do I get around the problem of
really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time. The simplest
way to do it is something like this. 

By dancing. It's like this. 

Thanks. 

So that's probably the easiest way. But if you want to do something a little bit more
immediate, something that you can't achieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer
your voice up. There's things like pitch-shifting, which are awesome, and I'm going to
show you now what that sounds like. So I'm going to start another beat for you, like this.

There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start, because it's just fun, so you can
clap along if you want. You don't have to. It's fine. Check it out. I'm going to lay down
a bass sound now. 

And now, a rockabilly guitar. Which is nice. But what if I want to make, say, a —

— Thanks. What if I want to make, say, a rock organ? Is that possible? Yes, it is, by
recording myself like this. (Organ sound) And now I have that, I have that recorded.
Assign it to a keyboard. 

So that's cool. 

But what if I wanted to sound like the whole of Pink Floyd? Impossible, you say. No. It is
possible, and you can do it very simply using this machine. It's really fantastic. Check
it out. 

So every noise you can hear there is my voice. I didn't just trigger something which
sounds like that. There's no samples. There's no synthesizers. That is literally all my
voice being manipulated, and when you get to that point, you have to ask, don't you,
what's the point? Why do this? 

Because it's cheaper than hiring the whole of Pink Floyd, I suppose, is the easy answer.
But in actual fact, I haven't made this machine so that I can emulate things that already
exist. I've made this so that I can make any noise that I can imagine. So with your
permission, I'm going to do some things that are in my mind, and I hope you enjoy them,
because they're rather unusual, especially when you're doing things which are as unusual
as this, it can be hard to believe that it is all my voice, you see. (Voice effects)

Like this. 

So, loosely defined, that is what's possible with the human voice. Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.
