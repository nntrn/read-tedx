title: Teach statistics before calculus!
speaker: Arthur Benjamin
description: >-
 Someone always asks the math teacher, "Am I going to use calculus in real life?"
 And for most of us, says Arthur Benjamin, the answer is no. He offers a bold
 proposal on how to make math education relevant in the digital age.

Now, if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics, then I would have a
suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this
country. And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive. The mathematics curriculum that
we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra. And everything we learn after
that is building up towards one subject. And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus. And
I'm here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ... that the
correct summit — that all of our students, every high school graduate should know — should
be statistics: probability and statistics. 

I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject. It's one of the great
products of the human mind. The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics, they should
definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college. But I'm here to
say, as a professor of mathematics, that very few people actually use calculus in a
conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives. On the other hand, statistics —
that's a subject that you could, and should, use on daily basis. Right? It's risk. It's
reward. It's randomness. It's understanding data. I think if our students, if our high
school students — if all of the American citizens — knew about probability and statistics,
we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. 

Not only — thank you — not only that ... but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of
fun. I mean, probability and statistics, it's the mathematics of games and gambling. It's
analyzing trends. It's predicting the future. Look, the world has changed from analog to
digital. And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital,
from the more classical, continuous mathematics, to the more modern, discrete mathematics
— the mathematics of uncertainty, of randomness, of data — that being probability and
statistics. In summary, instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus,
I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations
from the mean means. And I mean it. Thank you very much.
