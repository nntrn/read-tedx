In 1962, Buckminster Fuller presented the particularly audacious proposal for the
Geoscope. It was a 200-foot diameter geodesic sphere to be suspended over the East River
in New York City, in full view of the United Nations. It was a big idea, for sure, and it
was one that he felt could truly inform and deeply affect the decision making of this body
through animations of global data, trends and other information regarding the globe, on
this sphere. And today, 45 years later, we clearly have no less need for this kind of
clarity and perspective, but what we do have is improved technology. Today we don't need
one million light bulbs to create a spherical display. We can use LEDs. LEDs are smaller,
they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient. Most importantly for
this, they're faster. And this speed, combined with today's high-performance
micro-controllers, allows us to actually simulate, in this piece, over 17,000 LEDs — using
just 64.

And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision. But as this
ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm — that's 28 times per second. The equator's speed is
actually about 60 miles per hour. There are four on-board micro-controllers that, each
time this ring rotates it, as it passes the rear of the display, it picks up a position
signal. And from that, the on-board micro-controllers can extrapolate the position of the
ring at all points around the revolution and display arbitrary bitmap images and
animations. But this is really just the beginning. In addition to higher resolution
versions of this display, my father and I are working on a new patent-pending design for a
fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon. It achieves this by rotating LEDs
about two axes. So as you can see here, this is a, eleven-inch diameter circuit board.
These blocks represent LEDs. And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this
axis, it will create a disc of light that we can control.

That's nothing new: that's a propeller clock; that's the rims that you can buy for your
car. But what is new is that, when we rotate this disc about this axis, this disc of light
actually becomes a sphere of light. And so we can control that with micro-controllers and
create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs. Now this piece is
currently in process — due out in May — but what we've done is we've put together a small
demo, just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere. I've got a little
video to show you, but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control, and this is
also with only four LEDs. This is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final
display will be in May. So, take a look. And here you can see it's rotating about the
vertical axis only, creating circles. And then, as the other axis kicks in, those actually
blur into a volume.

And the shutter speed of the camera actually makes it slightly less effective in this
case. But this piece is due out in May. It'll be on display at the Interactive
Telecommunications Spring Show in Greenwich Village in New York City — that's open to the
public, definitely invite you all to come and attend — it's a fantastic show. There are
hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects. This piece, actually, will be on
display down in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the
show. So I'd love to talk to you all, and invite you to come down and take a closer look.
It's an honor to be here. Thanks very much.
