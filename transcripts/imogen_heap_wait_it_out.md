♫ Where do we go from here? ♫♫ How do we carry on? ♫♫ I can't get beyond the questions ♫♫
Clambering for the scraps ♫ ♫ in the shatter of us, collapsed ♫♫ It cuts me with every
could have been ♫♫ Pain on pain on play, repeating ♫♫ With the backup, makeshift life in
waiting ♫♫ Everybody says ♫ ♫ time heals everything ♫♫ What of the wretched hollow? ♫ ♫
The endless in between? ♫♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫♫ There is nothing to see
here now ♫♫ Turning the sign around ♫♫ We're closed to the Earth 'til further notice ♫♫ A
crumbling cliche case ♫ ♫ crumpled and puffy faced ♫♫ caught dead in the stare of a
thousand miles ♫♫ All I want, only one street level miracle ♫♫ I'll be an out and out born
again ♫ ♫ from none more cynical ♫♫ Everybody says ♫ ♫ that time heals everything ♫♫ But
what of the wretched hollow? ♫ ♫ The endless in between? ♫♫ Are we just going to wait it
out? ♫ ♫ And sit here cold?

♫♫ We will be long gone by then ♫♫ In lackluster ♫♫ In dust we lay around old magazines ♫♫
Fluorescent lighting sets the scene ♫♫ for all we could and should be being ♫♫ in the one
life that we've got ♫♫ Everybody says ♫♫ time heals everything ♫♫ And what of the wretched
hollow? ♫♫ The endless in between? ♫♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫♫ Just going to
sweat it out? ♫♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫♫ Wait it out ♫
