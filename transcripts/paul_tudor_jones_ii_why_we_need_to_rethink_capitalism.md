title: Why we need to rethink capitalism
speaker: Paul Tudor Jones II
description: >-
 Paul Tudor Jones II loves capitalism. It's a system that has done him very well
 over the last few decades. Nonetheless, the hedge fund manager and philanthropist
 is concerned that a laser focus on profits is, as he puts it, "threatening the
 very underpinnings of society." In this thoughtful, passionate talk, he outlines
 his planned counter-offensive, which centers on the concept of "justness."

This is a story about capitalism. It's a system I love because of the successes and
opportunities it's afforded me and millions of others. I started in my 20s trading
commodities, cotton in particular, in the pits, and if there was ever a free market
free-for-all, this was it, where men wearing ties but acting like gladiators fought
literally and physically for a profit. Fortunately, I was good enough that by the time I
was 30, I was able to move into the upstairs world of money management, where I spent the
next three decades as a global macro trader. And over that time, I've seen a lot of crazy
things in the markets, and I've traded a lot of crazy manias. And unfortunately, I'm sad
to report that right now we might be in the grips of one of the most disastrous,
certainly of my career, and one consistent takeaway is manias never end well. Now, over the
past 50 years, we as a society have come to view our companies and corporations in a very
narrow, almost monomaniacal fashion with regard to how we value them, and we have put so
much emphasis on profits, on short-term quarterly earnings and share prices, at the
exclusion of all else.

It's like we've ripped the humanity out of our companies. Now, we don't do that —
conveniently reduce something to a set of numbers that you can play with like Lego toys —
we don't do that in our individual life. We don't treat somebody or value them based on
their monthly income or their credit score, but we have this double standard when it
comes to the way that we value our businesses, and you know what? It's threatening the
very underpinnings of our society. And here's how you'll see. This chart is corporate
profit margins going back 40 years as a percentage of revenues, and you can see that we're
at a 40-year high of 12.5 percent. Now, hooray if you're a shareholder, but if you're the
other side of that, and you're the average American worker, then you can see it's not such
a good thing. ["U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs. CEO-to-Worker Compensation
Ratio"]Now, higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth.

What they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality, and that's not a good thing.
But intuitively, that makes sense, right? Because if the top 10 percent of American
families own 90 percent of the stocks, as they take a greater share of corporate profits,
then there's less wealth left for the rest of society. Again, income inequality is not a
good thing. This next chart, made by The Equality Trust, shows 21 countries from Austria
to Japan to New Zealand. On the horizontal axis is income inequality. The further to the
right you go, the greater the income inequality. On the vertical axis are nine social and
health metrics. The more you go up that, the worse the problems are, and those metrics
include life expectancy, teenage pregnancy, literacy, social mobility, just to name a few.
Now, those of you in the audience who are Americans may wonder, well, where does the
United States rank? Where does it lie on that chart? And guess what? We're literally off
the chart.

Yes, that's us, with the greatest income inequality and the greatest social problems,
according to those metrics. Now, here's a macro forecast that's easy to make, and that's,
that gap between the wealthiest and the poorest, it will get closed. History always does
it. It typically happens in one of three ways: either through revolution, higher taxes, or
wars. None of those are on my bucket list. 

Now, there's another way to do it, and that's by increasing justness in corporate
behavior, but the way that we're operating right now, that would require a tremendous
change in behavior, and like an addict trying to kick a habit, the first step is to
acknowledge that you have a problem. And let me just say, this profits mania that we're on
is so deeply entrenched that we don't even realize how we're harming society. Here's a
small but startling example of exactly how we're doing that: this chart shows corporate
giving as a percentage of profits, not revenues, over the last 30 years. Juxtapose that
to the earlier chart of corporate profit margins, and I ask you, does that feel right? In
all fairness, when I started writing this, I thought, "Oh wow, what does my company, what
does Tudor do?" And I realized we give one percent of corporate profits to charity every
year. And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist. When I realized that, I literally wanted to
throw up.

But the point is, this mania is so deeply entrenched that well-intentioned people like
myself don't even realize that we're part of it. Now, we're not going to change corporate
behavior by simply increasing corporate philanthropy or charitable contributions. And oh,
by the way, we've since quadrupled that, but — 

— Please. But we can do it by driving more just behavior. And one way to do it is actually
trusting the system that got us here in the first place, and that's the free market
system. About a year ago, some friends of mine and I started a not-for-profit called Just
Capital. Its mission is very simple: to help companies and corporations learn how to
operate in a more just fashion by using the public's input to define exactly what the
criteria are for just corporate behavior. Now, right now, there's no widely accepted
standard that a company or corporation can follow, and that's where Just Capital comes in,
because beginning this year and every year we'll be conducting a nationwide survey of a
representative sample of 20,000 Americans to find out exactly what they think are the
criteria for justness in corporate behavior. Now, this is a model that's going to start in
the United States but can be expanded anywhere around the globe, and maybe we'll find out
that the most important thing for the public is that we create living wage jobs, or make
healthy products, or help, not harm, the environment.

At Just Capital, we don't know, and it's not for us to decide. We're but messengers, but
we have 100 percent confidence and faith in the American public to get it right. So we'll
release the findings this September for the first time, and then next year, we'll poll
again, and we'll take the additive step this time of ranking the 1,000 largest U.S.
companies from number one to number 1,000 and everything in between. We're calling it the
Just Index, and remember, we're an independent not-for-profit with no bias, and we will be
giving the American public a voice. And maybe over time, we'll find out that as people
come to know which companies are the most just, human and economic resources will be
driven towards them, and they'll become the most prosperous and help our country be the
most prosperous. Now, capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation that's
made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in. Capitalism has to be
based on justice.

It has to be, and now more than ever, with economic divisions growing wider every day.
It's estimated that 47 percent of American workers can be displaced in the next 20 years.
I'm not against progress. I want the driverless car and the jet pack just like everyone
else. But I'm pleading for recognition that with increased wealth and profits has to come
greater corporate social responsibility."If justice is removed," said Adam Smith, the
father of capitalism, "the great, the immense fabric of human society must in a moment
crumble into atoms."Now, when I was young, and there was a problem, my mama used to always
sigh and shake her head and say, "Have mercy, have mercy." Now's not the time for us, for
the rest of us to show them mercy. The time is now for us to show them fairness, and we
can do that, you and I, by starting where we work, in the businesses that we operate in.
And when we put justness on par with profits, we'll get the most wonderful thing in all
the world.

We'll take back our humanity. Thank you.
