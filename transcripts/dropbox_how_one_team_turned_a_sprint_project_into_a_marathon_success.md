title: How one team turned a sprint project into a marathon success
speaker: Dropbox
description: >-
 TED Resident Keith Kirkland and his team at WearWorks use haptic technology to
 develop products and experiences that communicate information through touch. In
 2017, they were faced with a seemingly impossible challenge: quickly develop a
 device for a blind ultra-marathon runner to compete -- unaided and unassisted --
 in the New York City Marathon. Jennifer Brook, a design researcher at Dropbox,
 explains how the team at WearWorks navigated the challenges and tensions of
 designing this groundbreaking new technology.

Keith Kirkland: We believe in making the world a better place, and we're trying to do that
through design, but the world for us starts with our company.

Our first product, Wayband, is a wearable haptic navigation device for the blind and
visually impaired. We had gotten an article published and it had made its way to this guy,
Simon Wheatcroft. He reached out to us and he was like, "If you can have this technology
ready by November, I'll run the New York City Marathon with it." We saw it and was kind of
like, moonshot, this is probably not going to work, but let's just do it and see how far
we can get.

[Dropbox is a collaborative platform whose mission is to design a more enlightened way of
working. They are invested in understanding how teams like WearWorks achieve extraordinary
outcomes.]Jennifer Brook: In Keith's story, I see a microcosm that reflects a greater
macrocosm in terms of an emerging set of values. What we found is that everyone has a set
of tensions in their work and life, things like making a living and making a life, or
fulfilling the organization's needs and the needs of the individual. We navigate those
tensions using our own unique strategies, for example, working remotely, learning new
skills, or self care. Navigating these tensions is critical, because a lot is at stake for
us when we show up to work, like our sense of purpose or our connection to our families
and communities. And for me, in this organization, this is why we should care about
designing a more enlightened way of working. KK: We see a company as a vehicle to design
life with as opposed to something to conform to. JB: WearWorks is really thinking
holistically about navigating their tensions.

For example, when it comes to a tension like making a living and making a life, what kinds
of cultural practices and policies need to be in place to support a strategy like flexible
or remote work? KK: At WearWorks, we have this policy called WhereverWorks, and the basic
idea is that we don't really care where people are as long as the work gets done. And by
doing so, we make our employees ridiculously happy. And by doing that, we get the best
work from people. JB: We're seeing that people everywhere are challenging these inherited,
default ways of working. They want access to more choices, more agency, the freedom to
decide how they want to work. This supports them to better navigate the tensions in their
work and life for the sake of preserving what's at stake for them. KK: We did a six-month
sprint, and on November 5, 2017, Simon ran the first 15 miles of the New York City
Marathon without any sight assistance. Working with the blind and visually impaired was a
wonderful challenge.

It's a different feeling when you go to work every day and the thing that you do actually
helped the needle of humanity, in some way, move forward. JB: WearWorks embodies what an
enlightened way of working means for people out in the world today.
