title: The dangers of mixing drugs
speaker: Céline Valéry
description: >-
 Which of the following is risky behavior: a person taking cholesterol medicine
 with grapefruit juice? Or a person taking Acetaminophen before going out for
 drinks? Or a person on blood thinners who takes an aspirin? Turns out, all of
 them are risky. Each has inadvertently created a drug interaction that could lead
 to serious complications. Céline Valéry describes the dangers of mixing
 substances. [Directed by Cabong Studios, narrated by Susan Zimmerman, music by
 Matheus Wittmann].

Which of these three people is doing something risky? Is it the one who takes their
cholesterol medication with grapefruit juice? The one who takes Acetaminophen pain 
relievers for a sore ankle before going out for drinks? Or the one who’s on a
blood-thinning medication and takes an aspirin for a headache? Actually, all of them are.
Each has inadvertently created a drug interaction that could, in extreme cases, lead to
kidney failure; liver damage; or internal bleeding. Drug interactions happen when the
combination of a drug with another substance causes different effects than either would
individually. Foods, herbal supplements, legal drugs, and illicit substances can all
cause drug interactions. Most drug interactions fall into two categories. Some take place
when two substances’ effects influence each other directly. In other cases, one substance
effects how the body processes another, like how it is absorbed, metabolized, or
transported around the body. Blood thinners and aspirin, for example, have similar effects
that become dangerous when combined.

Both prevent blood clots from forming— blood thinners by preventing the formation of the
clotting factors that hold clots together, and aspirin by preventing blood cells from
clumping into groups that become clots. Individually, these effects are usually safe, but
taken together, they can prevent blood clotting to a dangerous extent, possibly causing
internal bleeding. While blood thinners and aspirin are generally harmless when taken
individually, interactions where one substance exacerbates the effects of another can
also take place between drugs that are independently harmful. Cocaine and heroin are each
dangerous, and those dangers compound when the two drugs are combined— even though their
behavioral effects may feel like they cancel each other out. Cocaine is a stimulant, and
many of its effects, like increased heart rate, cause the body to need more oxygen. But
heroin, a depressant, slows breathing— reducing the body’s oxygen supply just when it
needs more.

This combination strains the organs and can cause respiratory failure and death. The
interaction between grapefruit juice and certain medications in class of
cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, has to do with drug metabolism. The liver
produces enzymes, molecules that facilitate the breakdown of substances that enter the
body. Enzymes can both activate drugs, by breaking them down into their therapeutic
ingredients from more complex molecules, and deactivate them, by breaking harmful
compounds down into harmless metabolites. There are many, many different enzymes, each of
which has a binding site that fits a specific molecule. Grapefruit binds to the same
enzyme as statins, making less of that enzyme available to break down statins. So
combining the two means that a greater concentration of the drug stays in the bloodstream
for a longer period of time, potentially causing kidney failure. Alcohol can also alter
the function of the enzyme that breaks down Acetaminophen, the active ingredient in pain
relievers like Tylenol and paracetamol.

When someone takes Acetaminophen, some of it is converted into a toxic substance. At the
recommended dose, there isn’t usually enough of this toxic byproduct to cause harm. But
heavy drinking can alter enzyme activity so more of that byproduct is produced,
potentially causing liver damage even with what’s usually a safe dose of 
acetominophen. Meanwhile, the herbal remedy Saint John’s Wort increases the liver’s
production of a particular enzyme. That means the drugs this enzyme is responsible for
breaking down get metabolized faster— sometimes too fast, before they can have their
therapeutic effects. In spite of the dizzying number of possible interactions, most of the
dangerous interactions with commonly used drugs are well known. And new developments in
science are helping us keep better track of drug interactions than ever. Some researchers
are developing AI programs that can predict the side effects of drug interactions before
they occur, using information about the landscape of protein interactions within your
body.

For the new drugs that are being developed all the time, supercomputers are being used to
find potential interactions while those drugs are still in development.
