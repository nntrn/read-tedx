title: Sculptures that’d be at home in the deep sea
speaker: Shih Chieh Huang
description: >-
 When he was young, artist Shih Chieh Huang loved taking toys apart and perusing
 the aisles of night markets in Taiwan for unexpected objects. Today, this TED
 Fellow creates madcap sculptures that seem to have a life of their own—with eyes
 that blink, tentacles that unfurl and parts that light up like bioluminescent sea
 creatures.

I was born in Taiwan. I grew up surrounded by different types of hardware stores, and I
like going to night markets. I love the energy of the night markets, the colors, the
lights, the toys, and all the unexpected things I find every time I go, things like
watermelon with straw antennas or puppies with mohawks. When I was growing up, I liked
taking toys apart, any kind of toys I'd find around the house, like my brother's BB gun
when he's not home. I also liked to make environments for people to explore and play. In
these early installations, I would take plastic sheets, plastic bags, and things I would
find in the hardware store or around the house. I would take things like highlighter pen,
mix it with water, pump it through plastic tubing, creating these glowing circulatory
systems for people to walk through and enjoy. I like these materials because of the way
they look, the way they feel, and they're very affordable. I also liked to make devices
that work with body parts.

I would take camera LED lights and a bungee cord and strap it on my waist and I would
videotape my belly button, get a different perspective, and see what it does.

I also like to modify household appliances. This is an automatic night light. Some of you
might have them at home. I would cut out the light sensor, add an extension line, and use
modeling clay, stick it onto the television, and then I would videotape my eye, and using
the dark part of my eye tricking the sensor into thinking it's night time, so you turn on
the lightbulb. The white of the eye and the eyelid will trick the sensor into thinking
it's daytime, and it will shut off the light. I wanted to collect more different types of
eyes, so I built this device using bicycle helmets, some lightbulbs and television sets.
It would be easier for other people to wear the helmet and record their eyes. This device
allows me to symbolically extract other people's eyes, so I have a diversity of eyes to
use for my other sculptures. This sculpture has four eyes. Each eye is controlling a
different device. This eye is turning itself around in a television. This eye is inflating
a plastic tube.

This eye is watching a video of another piece being made. And these two eyes are
activating glowing water. Many of these pieces are later on shown in museums, biennials,
triennial exhibitions around the world. I love science and biology. In 2007, I was doing a
research fellowship at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum looking at bioluminous
organisms in the oean. I love these creatures. I love the way they look, the way they
feel. They're soft, they're slimy, and I was fascinated by the way they use light in their
environment, either to attract mates, for self-defense, or to attract food. This research
inspired my work in many different ways, things like movement or different light patterns.
So I started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio and just
experimenting and trying this out, trying that out, and seeing what types of creatures I
can come up with. I used a lot of computer cooling fans and just kind of put them together
and see what happens.

This is an 8,000-square-foot installation composed of many different creatures, some
hanging from the ceiling and some resting on the floor. From afar, they look alien-like,
but when you look closer, they're all made out of black garbage bags or Tupperware
containers. I'd like to share with you how ordinary things can become something magical and
wondrous. 

Thank you.
