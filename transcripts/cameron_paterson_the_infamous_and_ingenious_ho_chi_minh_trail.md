title: The infamous and ingenious Ho Chi Minh Trail
speaker: Cameron Paterson
description: >-
 The Ho Chi Minh Trail not only connected North and South Vietnam during a brutal
 war but also aided Vietnamese soldiers. The trail shaved nearly five months of
 time off of the trip and was used as a secret weapon of sorts. Cameron Paterson
 describes the history and usage of the infamous trail. [Directed by Maxwell
 SÃ¸rensen, narrated by Cameron Paterson].

Deep in the jungles of Vietnam, soldiers from both sides battled heat exhaustion and each
other for nearly 20 long years. But the key to Communist victory wasn't weapons or
stamina, it was a dirt road. The Ho Chi Minh Trail, winding through Vietnam, Laos, and
Cambodia, started as a simple network of dirt roads and blossomed into the centerpiece of
the winning North Vietnamese strategy during the Vietnam War, supplying weapons, troops,
and psychological support to the South. The trail was a network of tracks, dirt roads, and
river crossings that threaded west out of North Vietnam and south along the Truong Son
Mountain Range between Vietnam and Laos. The journey to the South originally took six
months. But, with engineering and ingenuity, the Vietnamese expanded and improved the
trail. Towards the end of war, as the main roads detoured through Laos, it only took one
week. Here is how it happened.

In 1959, as relations deteriorated between the North and the South, a system of trails was
constructed in order to infiltrate soldiers, weapons, and supplies into South Vietnam. The
first troops moved in single-file along routes used by local ethnic groups, and broken
tree branches at dusty crossroads were often all that indicated the direction. Initially,
most of the Communist cadres who came down the trail were Southerners by birth who had
trained in North Vietnam. They dressed like civilian peasants in black, silk pajamas with
a checkered scarf. They wore Ho Chi Minh sandals on their feet, cut from truck tires, and
carried their ration of cooked rice in elephants' intestines, a linen tube hung around the
body. The conditions were harsh and many deaths were caused by exposure, malaria, and
amoebic dysentery. Getting lost, starving to death, and the possibility of attacks by wild
tigers or bears were constant threats.

Meals were invariably just rice and salt, and it was easy to run out. Fear, boredom, and
homesickness were the dominant emotions. And soldiers occupied their spare time by writing
letters, drawing sketches, and drinking and smoking with local villagers. The first troops
down the trail did not engage in much fighting. And after an exhausting six month trip,
arriving in the South was a real highlight, often celebrated by bursting into song. By
1965, the trip down the trail could be made by truck. Thousands of trucks supplied by
China and Russia took up the task amidst ferocious B-52 bombing and truck drivers became
known as pilots of the ground. As traffic down the trail increased, so did the U.S.
bombing. They drove at night or in the early morning to avoid air strikes, and watchmen
were ready to warn drivers of enemy aircraft. Villages along the trail organized teams to
guarantee traffic flow and to help drivers repair damage caused by air
attacks.

Their catch cries were, "Everything for our Southern brothers!" and, "We will not worry
about our houses if the vehicles have not yet gotten through." Some families donated their
doors and wooden beds to repair roads. Vietnamese forces even used deception to get the
U.S. aircraft to bomb mountainsides in order to make gravel for use in building and
maintaining roads. The all-pervading red dust seeped into every nook and cranny. The Ho
Chi Minh Trail had a profound impact on the Vietnam War and it was the key to Hanoi's
success. North Vietnamese victory was not determined by the battlefields, but by the
trail, which was the political, strategic, and economic lynchpin. Americans recognized its
achievement, calling the trail, "One of the great achievements in military engineering of
the 20th century." The trail is a testimony to the strength of will of the Vietnamese
people, and the men and women who used the trail have become folk heros.
