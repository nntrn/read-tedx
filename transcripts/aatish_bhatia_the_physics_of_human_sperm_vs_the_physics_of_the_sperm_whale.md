title: The physics of human sperm vs. the physics of the sperm whale
speaker: Aatish Bhatia
description: >-
 Traveling is extremely arduous for microscopic sperm -- think of a human trying
 to swim in a pool made of...other humans. We can compare the journey of a sperm
 to that of a sperm whale by calculating the Reynolds number, a prediction of how
 fluid will behave, often fluctuating due to size of the swimmer. Aatish Bhatia
 explores the great (albeit tiny) sperm's journey. [Directed by Brad Purnell,
 narrated by Addison Anderson].

In 1977, the physicist Edward Purcell calculated that if you push a bacteria and then let
go, it will stop in about a millionth of a second. In that time, it will have traveled
less than the width of a single atom. The same holds true for a sperm and many other
microbes. It all has to do with being really small. Microscopic creatures inhabit a world
alien to us, where making it through an inch of water is an incredible endeavor. But why
does size matter so much for a swimmer? What makes the world of a sperm so fundamentally
different from that of a sperm whale? To find out, we need to dive into the physics of
fluids. Here's a way to think about it. Imagine you are swimming in a pool. It's you and a
whole bunch of water molecules. Water molecules outnumber you a thousand trillion trillion
to one. So, pushing past them with your gigantic body is easy, but if you were really
small, say you were about the size of a water molecule, all of a sudden, it's like you're
swimming in a pool of people.

Rather than simply swishing by all the teeny, tiny molecules, now every single water
molecule is like another person you have to push past to get anywhere. In 1883, the
physicist Osborne Reynolds figured out that there is one simple number that can predict
how a fluid will behave. It's called the Reynolds number, and it depends on simple
properties like the size of the swimmer, its speed, the density of the fluid, and the
stickiness, or the viscosity, of the fluid. What this means is that creatures of very
different sizes inhabit vastly different worlds. For example, because of its huge size, a
sperm whale inhabits the large Reynolds number world. If it flaps its tail once, it can
coast ahead for an incredible distance. Meanwhile, sperm live in a low Reynolds number
world. If a sperm were to stop flapping its tail, it wouldn't even coast past a single
atom. To imagine what it would feel like to be a sperm, you need to bring yourself down to
its Reynolds number.

Picture yourself in a tub of molasses with your arms moving about as slow as the minute
hand of a clock, and you'd have a pretty good idea of what a sperm is up against. So, how
do microbes manage to get anywhere? Well, many don't bother swimming at all. They just let
the food drift to them. This is somewhat like a lazy cow that waits for the grass under
its mouth to grow back. But many microbes do swim, and this is where those incredible
adaptations come in. One trick they can use is to deform the shape of their paddle. By
cleverly flexing their paddle to create more drag on the power stroke than on the recovery
stroke, single-celled organisms like paramecia manage to inch their way through the crowd
of water molecules. But there's an even more ingenious solution arrived at by bacteria and
sperm. Instead of wagging their paddles back and forth, they wind them like a cork screw.
Just as a cork screw on a wine bottle converts winding motion into forward motion, these
tiny creatures spin their helical tails to push themselves forward in a world where water
feels as thick as cork.

Other strategies are even stranger. Some bacteria take Batman's approach. They use
grappling hooks to pull themselves along. They can even use this grappling hook like a
sling shot and fling themselves forward. Others use chemical engineering. H. pylori lives
only in the slimy, acidic mucus inside our stomachs. It releases a chemical that thins out
the surrounding mucus, allowing it to glide through slime. Maybe it's no surprise that
these guys are also responsible for stomach ulcers. So, when you look really closely at
our bodies and the world around us, you can see all sorts of tiny creatures finding clever
ways to get around in a sticky situation. Without these adaptations, bacteria would never
find their hosts, and sperms would never make it to their eggs, which means you would
never get stomach ulcers, but you would also never be born in the first place.
