I was afraid of womanhood. Not that I'm not afraid now, but I've learned to pretend. I've
learned to be flexible. In fact, I've developed some interesting tools to help me deal
with this fear. Let me explain. Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up, little
girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful and pretty and gentle and soft, and we were
supposed to fit into roles that were sort of shadowy — really not quite clear what we were
supposed to be.

There were plenty of role models all around us. We had our mothers, our aunts, our
cousins, our sisters, and of course, the ever-present media bombarding us with images and
words, telling us how to be. Now my mother was different. She was a homemaker, but she and
I didn't go out and do girlie things together, and she didn't buy me pink outfits.
Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons. And I just ate it
up. I drew, and I drew, and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family, I could
draw, do what I wanted to do, and not have to perform, not have to speak — I was very shy
— and I could still get approval. I was launched as a cartoonist. Now when we're young, we
don't always know. We know there are rules out there, but we don't always know — we don't
perform them right, even though we are imprinted at birth with these things, and we're
told what the most important color in the world is. We're told what shape we're supposed
to be in.

We're told what to wear — 

— and how to do our hair — 

— and how to behave. Now the rules that I'm talking about are constantly being monitored by
the culture. We're being corrected, and the primary policemen are women, because we are
the carriers of the tradition. We pass it down from generation to generation. Not only
that — we always have this vague notion that something's expected of us. And on top of all
off these rules, they keep changing. 

We don't know what's going on half the time, so it puts us in a very tenuous
position.

Now if you don't like these rules, and many of us don't — I know I didn't, and I still
don't, even though I follow them half the time, not quite aware that I'm following them —
what better way than to change them [than] with humor? Humor relies on the traditions of a
society. It takes what we know, and it twists it. It takes the codes of behavior and the
codes of dress, and it makes it unexpected, and that's what elicits a laugh. Now what if
you put together women and humor? I think you can get change. Because women are on the
ground floor, and we know the traditions so well, we can bring a different voice to the
table. Now I started drawing in the middle of a lot of chaos. I grew up not far from here
in Washington D.C. during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations, the Watergate
hearings and then the feminist movement, and I think I was drawing, trying to figure out
what was going on.

And then also my family was in chaos, and I drew to try to bring my family together —

— try to bring my family together with laughter. It didn't work. My parents got divorced,
and my sister was arrested. But I found my place. I found that I didn't have to wear high
heels, I didn't have to wear pink, and I could feel like I fit in. Now when I was a little
older, in my 20s, I realized there are not many women in cartooning. And I thought, "Well,
maybe I can break the little glass ceiling of cartooning," and so I did. I became a
cartoonist. And then I thought — in my 40s I started thinking, "Well, why don't I do
something? I always loved political cartoons, so why don't I do something with the content
of my cartoons to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following as well as
laugh?"Now my perspective is a particularly — 

— my perspective is a particularly American perspective. I can't help it. I live here.
Even though I've traveled a lot, I still think like an American woman. But I believe that
the rules that I'm talking about are universal, of course — that each culture has its
different codes of behavior and dress and traditions, and each woman has to deal with
these same things that we do here in the U.S. Consequently, we have. Women, because we're
on the ground, we know the tradition. We have amazing antennae. Now my work lately has been
to collaborate with international cartoonists, which I so enjoy, and it's given me a
greater appreciation for the power of cartoons to get at the truth, to get at the issues
quickly and succinctly. And not only that, it can get to the viewer through not only the
intellect, but through the heart. My work also has allowed me to collaborate with women
cartoonists from across the world — countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey,
Argentina, France — and we have sat together and laughed and talked and shared our
difficulties.

And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard in some very difficult
circumstances. But I feel blessed to be able to work with them. And we talk about how women
have such strong perceptions, because of our tenuous position and our role as
tradition-keepers, that we can have the great potential to be change-agents. And I think,
I truly believe, that we can change this thing one laugh at a time. Thank
you.
