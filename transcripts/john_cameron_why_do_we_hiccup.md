title: Why do we hiccup?
speaker: John Cameron
description: >-
 The longest recorded case of hiccups lasted for 68 years ... and was caused by a
 falling hog. While that level of severity is extremely uncommon, most of us are
 no stranger to an occasional case of the hiccups. But what causes these 'hics' in
 the first place? John Cameron takes us into the diaphragm to find out. [Directed
 by Black Powder Design, narrated by Addison Anderson].

Charles Osborne began to hiccup in 1922 after a hog fell on top of him. He wasn't cured
until 68 years later and is now listed by Guinness as the world record holder for hiccup
longevity. Meanwhile, Florida teen Jennifer Mee may hold the record for the most frequent
hiccups, 50 times per minute for more than four weeks in 2007. So what causes hiccups?
Doctors point out that a round of hiccups often follows from stimuli that stretch the
stomach, like swallowing air or too rapid eating or drinking. Others associate hiccups 
with intense emotions or a response to them: laughing, sobbing, anxiety, and excitement.
Let's look at what happens when we hiccup. It begins with an involuntary spasm or sudden
contraction of the diaphragm, the large dome-shaped muscle below our lungs that we use to
inhale air. This is followed almost immediately by the sudden closure of the vocal chords
and the opening between them, which is called the glottis.

The movement of the diaphragm initiates a sudden intake of air, but the closure of the
vocal chords stops it from entering the wind pipe and reaching the lungs. It also creates
the characteristic sound: "hic." To date, there is no known function for hiccups. They
don't seem to provide any medical or physiological advantage. Why begin to inhale air only
to suddenly stop it from actually entering the lungs? Anatomical structures, or
physiological mechanisms, with no apparent purpose present challenges to evolutionary
biologists. Do such structures serve some hidden function that hasn't yet been discovered?
Or are they relics of our evolutionary past, having once served some important purpose
only to persist into the present as vestigial remnants? One idea is that hiccups began
many millions of years before the appearance of humans. The lung is thought to have
evolved as a structure to allow early fish, many of which lived in warm, stagnant water
with little oxygen, to take advantage of the abundant oxygen in the air
overhead.

When descendants of these animals later moved onto land, they moved from gill-based
ventilation to air-breathing with lungs. That's similar to the much more rapid changes
faced by frogs today as they transition from tadpoles with gills to adults with lungs.
This hypothesis suggests that the hiccup is a relic of the ancient transition from water
to land. An inhalation that could move water over gills followed by a rapid closure of
the glottis preventing water from entering the lungs. That's supported by evidence which
suggests that the neural patterning involved in generating a hiccup is almost identical to
that responsible for respiration in amphibians. Another group of scientists believe that
the reflex is retained in us today because it actually provides an important advantage.
They point out that true hiccups are found only in mammals and that they're not retained
in birds, lizards, turtles, or any other exclusively air-breathing animals.

Further, hiccups appear in human babies long before birth and are far more common in
infants that adults. Their explanation for this involves the uniquely mammalian activity
of nursing. The ancient hiccup reflex may have been adapted by mammals to help remove air
from the stomach as a sort of glorified burp. The sudden expansion of the diaphragm would
raise air from the stomach, while a closure of the glottis would prevent milk from
entering the lungs. Sometimes, a bout of hiccups will go on and on, and we try home
remedies: sipping continuously from a glass of cold water, holding one's breath, a
mouthful of honey or peanut butter, breathing into a paper bag, or being suddenly
frightened. Unfortunately, scientists have yet to verify that any one cure works better or
more consistently than others. However, we do know one thing that definitely doesn't
work.
