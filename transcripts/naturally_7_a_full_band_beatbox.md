♫ I think I'm ready to do my thing ♫♫ I think I'm ready to take my chances ♫♫ I've been
dining out and all stressed out ♫♫ Due to the circumstances. See? ♫♫ I gotta get up, get
up, get up, get up ♫♫ Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up ♫♫ I see what you're saying ♫♫ We
sent a demo to the world, they said it sounds like Take 6 ♫♫ I said "Hold on, wait a
minute, I'll be back with the remix" ♫♫ They looking at us funny, we can't make any money
♫♫ It took us years to figure out that we was dealing with dummies ♫♫ They didn't
understand the sound from the Bronx, that's the boogie down ♫♫ to Huntsville, Alabama,
there's no circles in my planner, so ♫♫ It was time to make the product, so we hooked up
with Townsend ♫♫ Made a deal with John Neal, on the road sold ten thousand ♫♫ WBA, that
means a trip to Nashville ♫♫ Festplatte showed up and said them boys are naturals ♫♫ Can
you hear what they were hearing? See what they were seeing?

♫♫ From Bronx to Berlin, we took the tour European ♫♫ All vocal yeah, we widit, call the
album "What is it?" ♫♫ With Sarah Connor, set the goal for number one and we hit it ♫♫ But
now it's Kev, Sim, Drew, Stew, time for a new day ♫♫ Ring the alarm, hit 'em on Skype or a
two-way ♫♫ Sung by the words, we ready to fly! ♫♫ Fly baby! Time to leave that nest ♫♫ Fly
baby! This ain't no time to rest ♫♫ Come on fly baby, we got work to do ♫♫ Here we go,
spread my wings and ... ♫♫ Fly baby! Time to leave that nest ♫♫ Fly baby! This ain't no
time to rest. Come on ♫♫ Fly baby! We got work to do ♫♫ Here we go. Spread my wings and
fly. One more time ♫♫ Fly baby! Time to leave that nest ♫♫ Fly baby! This ain't no time to
rest ♫♫ Fly baby! We got work to do ♫♫ Here we go, spread my wings and ... ♫♫ Fly baby!
Fly baby fly ♫♫ Fly baby! Fly baby high ♫♫ Fly baby! Up to the sky ♫♫ Spread my wings and
fly ♫Instrumental!♫ We're ready to fly! ♫

Thank you very much.
