title: Selling condoms in the Congo
speaker: Amy Lockwood
description: >-
 HIV is a serious problem in the DR Congo, and aid agencies have flooded the
 country with free and cheap condoms. But few people are using them. Why?
 "Reformed marketer" Amy Lockwood offers a surprising answer that upends a
 traditional model of philanthropy. (Some NSFW images.)

I am a reformed marketer, and I now work in international development. In October, I spent
some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the [second] largest country in
Africa. In fact, it's as large as Western Europe, but it only has 300 miles of paved
roads. The DRC is a dangerous place. In the past 10 years, five million people have died
due to a war in the east. But war isn't the only reason that life is difficult in the
DRC.There are many health issues as well. In fact, the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent
among adults. This might not sound like a large number, but in a country with 76 million
people, it means there are 930,000 that are infected. And due to the poor infrastructure,
only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need. Which is why,
in part, donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost. And so while I was in the DRC, I
spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms, including Damien. Damien runs a hotel
outside of Kinshasa.

It's a hotel that's only open until midnight, so it's not a place that you stay. But it is
a place where sex workers and their clients come. Now Damien knows all about condoms, but
he doesn't sell them. He said there's just not in demand. It's not surprising, because
only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms. Joseph and Christine, who run a
pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms, said despite the fact that donor
agencies provide them at low or no cost, and they have marketing campaigns that go along
with them, their customers don't buy the branded versions. They like the generics. And as a
marketer, I found that curious. And so I started to look at what the marketing looked
like. And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for
these condoms: fear, financing and fidelity. They name the condoms things like Vive, "to
live" or Trust. They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV, put it in
boxes that remind you who paid for them, show pictures of your wife or husband and tell
you to protect them or to act prudently. Now these are not the kinds of things that someone
is thinking about just before they go get a condom.

What is it that you think about just before you get a condom? Sex! And the private
companies that sell condoms in these places, they understand this. Their marketing is
slightly different. The name might not be much different, but the imagery sure is. Some
brands are aspirational, and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative. And this
made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of
marketing: understanding who's the audience. And for donor agencies, unfortunately, the
audience tends to be people that aren't even in the country they're working [in]. It's
people back home, people that support their work, people like these. But if what we're
really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV, we need to think about the customer, the
people whose behavior needs to change — the couples, the young women, the young men —
whose lives depend on it. And so the lesson is this: it doesn't really matter what you're
selling; you just have to think about who is your customer, and what are the messages that
are going to get them to change their behavior.

It might just save their lives. Thank you.
