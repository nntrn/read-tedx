I'd like to begin this song I wrote about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want with a
poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder: "I find no peace, and
all my war is done; I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice; I fly above the wind, and
yet I cannot arise; And naught I have, and all the world I seize upon."♫ I want what I
can't have, need what I can't want ♫♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫♫ What I can't
have, need what I can't want ♫♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫♫ What I can't have,
need what I can't want ♫♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫♫ What I can't have, need
what I can't want ♫♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫♫ What I can't have, need what I
can't want ♫♫ Have but I don't have ♫♫ It feels like all I got is loss on a bad back ♫♫
Gone with the last train, honey don't you fret ♫♫ Every cloud has a silver lining ♫♫ Just
a little rain, just a little rain, just a little rain ♫♫ I want what I can't have, need
what I can't want ♫♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫♫ What I can't have, need what I
can't want ♫♫ Have but I don't have ♫♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫♫ Nobody
knows how to hold me ♫♫ My mind won't stop, and my heart says, ♫♫ "Good things come to
those who wait" ♫♫ And I can't stand in ...

♫♫ I can't stand in line forever ♫♫ Stand the cold air ♫♫ Glad-handed ♫♫ Sick and tired of
the "Later, maybe" ♫♫ Take it, fake it, take it, take-it-or-leave-it life ♫♫ And I gotta
just tame it ♫♫ I gotta just name it ♫♫ I gotta just seize, so please, oh please, oh
please, oh please ♫♫ Oh please me right, 'cause ♫♫ My mind won't stop ♫♫ And my heart says
go ♫♫ Nobody knows how to hold me ♫♫ My mind won't stop — and my heart says go-ooooo ...
♫♫ Good things must be here — yes, right here ♫♫ Here, right here, right here ♫♫ I won't
live this life forever ♫♫ One time round is all the offer is ♫♫ Sick and tired of the
"Later, maybe" ♫♫ Take it, fake it, make it, leave it life ♫♫ And I gotta just name it, I
gotta just claim it ♫♫ I gotta just seize ♫♫ Oh please, oh please, oh please me right ♫♫ I
want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫♫
What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫♫ Have but I don't have — you know that ♫♫ My
mind won't stop, and my heart says go ♫♫ Nobody knows how to hold me, no ♫♫ My mind won't
stop, and my heart says go ♫♫ 'Cause I want what I can't have, need what I can't want ♫♫
Have but I — have what I want ♫♫ What I can't have, need what I can't want ♫♫ What I can't
have, need what I can't want ♫♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫♫ What I can't have,
need what I can't want ♫♫ Have what I don't have, what I want ♫♫ What I can't have, need
what I can't want ♫♫ Have but I don't have, what I want ♫♫ What I can't have, need what I
can't want ♫♫ Have but I don't have what I want ♫
