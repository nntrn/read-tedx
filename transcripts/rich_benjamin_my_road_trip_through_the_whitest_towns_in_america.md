title: My road trip through the whitest towns in America
speaker: Rich Benjamin
description: >-
 As America becomes more and more multicultural, Rich Benjamin noticed a
 phenomenon: Some communities were actually getting less diverse. So he got out a
 map, found the whitest towns in the USA -- and moved in. In this funny, honest,
 human talk, he shares what he learned as a black man in Whitopia.

Imagine a place where your neighbors greet your children by name; a place with splendid
vistas; a place where you can drive just 20 minutes and put your sailboat on the water.
It's a seductive place, isn't it? I don't live there. 

But I did journey on a 27,000-mile trip for two years, to the fastest-growing and whitest
counties in America. What is a Whitopia? I define Whitopia in three ways: First, a Whitopia
has posted at least six percent population growth since 2000. Secondly, the majority of
that growth comes from white migrants. And third, the Whitopia has an ineffable charm, a
pleasant look and feel, a je Ne sais quoi. 

To learn how and why Whitopias are ticking, I immersed myself for several months apiece in
three of them: first, St. George, Utah; second, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; and third, Forsyth
County, Georgia. First stop, St. George — a beautiful town of red rock landscapes. In the
1850s, Brigham Young dispatched families to St. George to grow cotton because of the hot,
arid climate. And so they called it Utah's Dixie, and the name sticks to this day. I
approached my time in each Whitopia like an anthropologist. I made detailed spreadsheets
of all the power brokers in the communities, who I needed to meet, where I needed to be,
and I threw myself with gusto in these communities. I went to zoning board meetings, I
went to Democratic clubs and Republican clubs. I went to poker nights. In St. George, I
rented a home at the Entrada, one of the town's premier gated communities. There were no
Motel 6's or Howard Johnsons for me.

I lived in Whitopia as a resident, and not like a visitor. I rented myself this home by
phone. 

Golf is the perfect seductive symbol of Whitopia. When I went on my journey, I had barely
ever held a golf club. By the time I left, I was golfing at least three times a week.

Golf helps people bond. Some of the best interviews I ever scored during my trip were on
the golf courses. One venture capitalist, for example, invited me to golf in his private
club that had no minority members. I also went fishing. 

Because I had never fished, this fellow had to teach me how to cast my line and what bait
to use. I also played poker every weekend. It was Texas Hold 'em with a $10 buy-in. My
poker mates may have been bluffing about the hands that they drew, but they weren't
bluffing about their social beliefs. Some of the most raw, salty conversations I ever had
during my journey were at the poker table. I'm a gung ho entertainer. I love to cook, I
hosted many dinner parties, and in return, people invited me to their dinner parties, and
to their barbecues, and to their pool parties, and to their birthday parties. But it wasn't
all fun. Immigration turned out to be a big issue in this Whitopia. The St. George's
Citizens Council on Illegal Immigration held regular and active protests against
immigration, and so what I gleaned from this Whitopia is what a hot debate this would
become. It was a real-time preview, and so it has become. Next stop: Almost Heaven, a cabin
I rented for myself in Coeur d'Alene, in the beautiful North Idaho panhandle.

I rented this place for myself, also by phone. 

The book "A Thousand Places To See Before You Die" lists Coeur d'Alene — it's a gorgeous
paradise for huntsmen, boatmen and fishermen. My growing golf skills came in handy in Coeur
d'Alene. I golfed with retired LAPD cops. In 1993, around 11,000 families and cops fled
Los Angeles after the L.A. racial unrest, for North Idaho, and they've built an
expatriated community. Given the conservatism of these cops, there's no surprise that
North Idaho has a strong gun culture. In fact, it is said, North Idaho has more gun
dealers than gas stations. So what's a resident to do to fit in? I hit the gun club. When
I rented a gun, the gentleman behind the counter was perfectly pleasant and kind, until I
showed him my New York City driver's license. That's when he got nervous. I'm not as bad a
shot as I thought I might have been. What I learned from North Idaho is the peculiar brand
of paranoia that can permeate a community when so many cops and guns are around. In North
Idaho, in my red pickup truck, I kept a notepad.

And in that notepad I counted more Confederate flags than black people. In North Idaho, I
found Confederate flags on key chains, on cellphone paraphernalia, and on cars. About a
seven-minute drive from my hidden lake cabin was the compound of Aryan Nations, the white
supremacist group. America's Promise Ministries, the religious arm of Aryan Nations,
happened to have a three-day retreat during my visit. So I decided to crash it.

I'm the only non-Aryan journalist I'm aware of ever to have done so. 

Among the many memorable episodes of that retreat... 

...is when Abe, an Aryan, sidled up next to me. He slapped my knee, and he said, "Hey
Rich, I just want you to know one thing. We are not white supremacists. We are white
separatists. We don't think we're better than you, we just want to be away from you."

Indeed, most white people in Whitopia are neither white supremacists or white separatists;
in fact, they're not there for explicitly racial reasons at all. Rather, they emigrate
there for friendliness, comfort, security, safety — reasons that they implicitly associate
to whiteness in itself. Next stop was Georgia. In Georgia, I stayed in an exurb north of
Atlanta. In Utah, I found poker; in Idaho, I found guns; in Georgia, I found God.

The way that I immersed myself in this Whitopia was to become active at First Redeemer
Church, a megachurch that's so huge that it has golf carts to escort the congregants
around its many parking lots on campus. I was active in the youth ministry. And for me,
personally, I was more comfortable in this Whitopia than say, in a Colorado, or an Idaho,
or even a suburban Boston. That is because [there], in Georgia, white people and black
people are more historically familiar to one another. I was less exotic in this Whitopia.

But what does it all mean? Whitopian dreaming, Whitopia migration, is a push-pull
phenomenon, full of alarming pushes and alluring pulls, and Whitopia operates at the level
of conscious and unconscious bias. It's possible for people to be in Whitopia not for
racist reasons, though it has racist outcomes. Many Whitopians feel pushed by illegals,
social welfare abuse, minorities, density, crowded schools. Many Whitopians feel pulled by
merit, freedom, the allure of privatism — privatized places, privatized people, privatized
things. And I learned in Whitopia how a country can have racism without racists. Many of my
smug urban liberal friends couldn't believe I would go on such a venture. The reality is
that many white Americans are affable and kind. Interpersonal race relations — how we
treat each other as human beings — are vastly better than in my parents' generation. Can
you imagine me going to Whitopia 40 years ago? What a journey that would have
been.

And yet, some things haven't changed. America is as residentially and educationally
segregated today as it was in 1970.As Americans, we often find ways to cook for each
other, to dance with each other, to host with each other, but why can't that translate
into how we treat each other as communities? It's a devastating irony, how we have gone
forward as individuals, and backwards as communities. One of the Whitopian outlooks that
really hit me was a proverbial saying: "One black man is a delightful dinner guest; 50
black men is a ghetto."One of the big contexts animating my Whitopian journey was the year
2042. By 2042, white people will no longer be the American majority. As such, will there
be more Whitopias? In looking at this, the danger of Whitopia is that the more segregation
we have, the less we can look at and confront conscious and unconscious bias. I ventured on
my two-year, 27,000 mile journey to learn where, why, and how white people are fleeing,
but I didn't expect to have so much fun on my journey.

I didn't expect to learn so much about myself. I don't expect I'll be living in a Whitopia
— or a Blacktopia, for that matter. I do plan to continue golfing every chance I get.

And I'll just have to leave the guns and megachurches back in Whitopia. Thank
you.
