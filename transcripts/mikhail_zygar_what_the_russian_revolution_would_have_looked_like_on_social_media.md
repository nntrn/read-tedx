title: What the Russian Revolution would have looked like on social media
speaker: Mikhail Zygar
description: >-
 History is written by the victors, as the saying goes -- but what would it look
 like if it was written by everyone? Journalist and TED Fellow Mikhail Zygar is on
 a mission to show us with Project1917, a "social network for dead people" that
 posts the real diaries and letters of more than 3,000 people who lived during the
 Russian Revolution. By showing the daily thoughts of the likes of Lenin, Trotsky
 and many less celebrated figures, the project sheds new light on history as it
 once was -- and as it could have been. Learn more about this digital retelling of
 the past as well as Zygar's latest project about the transformative year of
 1968.

What is history? It is something written by the winners. There is a stereotype that
history should be focused on the rulers, like Lenin or Trotsky. As a result, people in
many countries, like mine, Russia, look at history as something that was predetermined or
determined by the leaders, and common people could not influence it in any way. Many
Russians today do not believe that Russia could ever have been or ever will be a truly
democratic nation, and this is due to the way history has been framed to the citizens of
Russia. And this is not true. To prove it, I spent two years of my life trying to go 100
years back, to the year 1917, the year of the Russian Revolution. I asked myself, what if
the internet and Facebook existed 100 years ago? So last year, we built a social network
for dead people, named Project1917.com. My team and I created our software, digitized and
uploaded all possible real diaries and letters written by more than 3,000 people 100 years
ago.

So any user of our website or application can follow a news feed for each day of 1917 and
read what people like Stravinsky or Trotsky, Lenin or Pavlova and others thought and felt.
We watch all those personalities being ordinary people like you and me, not demigods, and
we see that history consists of their mistakes, fears, weaknesses, not only their "genius
ideas."Our project was a shock for many Russians, who used to think that our country has
always been an autocratic empire and the ideas of freedom and democracy could never have
prevailed, just because democracy was not our destiny. But if we take a broader look, it's
not that black and white. Yes, 1917 led to 70 years of communist dictatorship. But with
this project, we see that Russia could have had a different history and a democratic
future, as any other country could or still can. Reading the posts from 1917, you learn
that Russia was the first country in the world to abolish the death penalty, or one of the
first ones to grant women voting rights. Knowing history and understanding how ordinary
people influenced history can help us create a better future, because history is just a
rehearsal of what's happening right now.

We do need new ways of telling history, and this year, for example, we started a new
online project that is called 1968Digital.com, and that is an online documentary series
that gives you an impression of that year, 1968, a year marked by global social change
that, in many ways, created the world as we know it now. But we are making that history
alive by imagining what if all the main characters could use mobile phones ... just like
that? And we see that a lot of individuals were facing the same challenges and were
fighting for the same values, no matter if they lived in the US or in USSR or in France or
in China or in Czechoslovakia. By exposing history in such a democratic way, through social
media, we show that people in power are not the only ones making choices. That gives any
user a possibility of reclaiming history. Ordinary people matter. They have an impact.
Ideas matter. Journalists, scientists, philosophers matter. We shape society.

We all make history. Thank you.
