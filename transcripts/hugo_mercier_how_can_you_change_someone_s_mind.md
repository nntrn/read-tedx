Three people are at a dinner party. Paul, who’s married, is looking at Linda. Meanwhile,
Linda is looking at John, who’s not married. Is someone who’s married looking at someone
who’s not married? Take a moment to think about it. Most people answer that there’s not
enough information to tell. And most people are wrong. Linda must be either married or
not married—there are no other options. So in either scenario, someone married is looking
at someone who’s not married. When presented with the explanation, most people change
their minds and accept the correct answer, despite being very confident in their first
responses. Now let’s look at another case. A 2005 study by Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler
examined American attitudes regarding the justifications for the Iraq War. Researchers
presented participants with a news article that showed no weapons of mass destruction
had been found.

Yet many participants not only continued to believe that WMDs had been found, but they
even became more convinced of their original views. So why do arguments change people’s
minds in some cases and backfire in others? Arguments are more convincing when they rest
on a good knowledge of the audience, taking into account what the audience believes, who
they trust, and what they value. Mathematical and logical arguments like the dinner party
brainteaser work because even when people reach different conclusions, they’re starting
from the same set of shared beliefs. In 1931, a young, unknown mathematician named Kurt
Gödel presented a proof that a logically complete system of mathematics was impossible.
Despite upending decades of work by brilliant mathematicians like Bertrand Russell and
David Hilbert, the proof was accepted because it relied on axioms that everyone in the
field already agreed on. Of course, many disagreements involve different beliefs that
can’t simply be reconciled through logic.

When these beliefs involve outside information, the issue often comes down to what
sources and authorities people trust. One study asked people to estimate several
statistics related to the scope of climate change. Participants were asked questions, such
as “how many of the years between 1995 and 2006 were one of the hottest 12 years since
1850?” After providing their answers, they were presented with data from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in this case showing that the answer was 11 of
the 12 years. Being provided with these reliable statistics from a trusted official
source made people more likely to accept the reality that the earth is warming. Finally,
for disagreements that can’t be definitively settled with statistics or evidence, making
a convincing argument may depend on engaging the audience’s values. For example,
researchers have conducted a number of studies where they’ve asked people of different
political backgrounds to rank their values.

Liberals in these studies, on average, rank fairness— here meaning whether everyone is
treated in the same way—above loyalty. In later studies, researchers attempted to
convince liberals to support military spending with a variety of arguments. Arguments
based on fairness— like that the military provides employment and education to people 
from disadvantaged backgrounds— were more convincing than arguments based on loyalty—
such as that the military unifies a nation. These three elements— beliefs, trusted
sources, and values— may seem like a simple formula for finding agreement and consensus.
The problem is that our initial inclination is to think of arguments that rely on our own
beliefs, trusted sources, and values. And even when we don’t, it can be challenging to
correctly identify what’s held dear by people who don’t already agree with us. The best
way to find out is simply to talk to them. In the course of discussion, you’ll be exposed
to counter-arguments and rebuttals.

These can help you make your own arguments and reasoning more convincing and sometimes,
you may even end up being the one changing your mind.
