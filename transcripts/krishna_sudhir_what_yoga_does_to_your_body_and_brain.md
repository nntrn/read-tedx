 There are many different approaches to modern yoga— though most forms have three
 core elements: physical postures, breathing exercises, and spiritual contemplation.This
 blend of physical and mental exercise is widely believed to have a unique set of

At some point between the 1st and 5th century CE, the Hindu sage Patañjali began to
codify the ancient, meditative traditions practiced throughout India. He recorded
techniques nearly as old as Indian civilization itself in 196 manuals called the Yoga
Sutras. These texts defined yoga as the ‘yoking’ or restraining of the mind from focusing
on external objects in efforts to reach a state of pure consciousness. Over time, yoga
came to incorporate physical elements from gymnastics and wrestling. Today, there are a
multitude of approaches to modern yoga— though most still maintain the three core elements
of Patañjali’s practice: physical postures, breathing exercises, and spiritual
contemplation. This blend of physical and mental exercise is widely believed to have a
unique set of health advantages. Such as improving strength and flexibility, boosting
heart and lung function, and enhancing psychological well-being.

But what have contemporary studies shown regarding the benefits of this ancient
tradition? Despite attempts by many researchers, it's tough to make specific claims about
yoga's advantages. Its unique combination of activities makes it difficult to determine
which component is producing a specific health benefit. Additionally, yoga studies are
often made up of small sample sizes that lack diversity, and the heavy reliance on
self-reporting makes results subjective. However, there are some health benefits that have
more robust scientific support than others. Let’s start with flexibility and strength.
Twisting your body into yoga’s physical postures stretches multiple muscle groups. In the
short term, stretching can change the water content of these muscles, ligaments, and
tendons to make them more elastic. Over time, regular stretching stimulates stem cells
which then differentiate into new muscle tissue and other cells that generate elastic
collagen.

Frequent stretching also reduces the body’s natural reflex to constrict muscles,
improving your pain tolerance for feats of flexibility. Researchers haven’t found that
any one form of yoga improves flexibility more than another, so the impact of specific 
postures is unclear. But like other low-impact exercises, yoga reliably improves fitness 
and flexibility in healthy populations. The practice has also been shown to be a
potentially powerful therapeutic tool. In studies involving patients with a variety of
musculo-skeletal disorders, yoga was more helpful at reducing pain and improving mobility
than other forms of low-impact exercise. Adding yoga to an existing exercise routine can
improve strength and flexibility for hard to treat conditions like chronic lower back
pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis. Yoga’s mix of physical exercise and
regimented breathing has proven similarly therapeutic for lung health.

Lung diseases like chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma shrink the passageways that
carry oxygen, while weakening the membrane that brings oxygen into the blood. But
breathing exercises like those found in yoga relax the muscles constricting those
passageways and improve oxygen diffusion. Increasing the blood’s oxygen content is
especially helpful for those with weak heart muscles who have difficulty pumping enough
oxygen throughout the body. And for those with healthy hearts, this practice can lower
blood pressure and reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Yoga’s most widely
celebrated benefit may be the most difficult to prove: its psychological effects. Despite
the longstanding association between yoga and psychological wellbeing, there’s little
conclusive evidence on how the practice affects mental health. One of the biggest claims
is that yoga improves symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders.

Since diagnosis of these conditions varies widely as do their origin and severity, it’s
difficult to quantify yoga’s impact. However, there is evidence to suggest that yoga can
help reduce the symptoms of stress, as well as meditation or relaxation. Research on the
effects of yoga is still evolving. In the future, we’ll need larger studies, 
incorporating diverse participants, which can measure yoga’s impact on heart attacks,
cancer rates, cognitive function and more. But for now, yoga can continue its ancient
tradition as a way to exercise, reflect, and relax.
