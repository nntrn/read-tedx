title: What would happen if you didn't sleep?
speaker: Claudia Aguirre
description: >-
 In the United States, it's estimated that 30 percent of adults and 66 percent of
 adolescents are regularly sleep-deprived. This isn't just a minor inconvenience:
 staying awake can cause serious bodily harm. Claudia Aguirre shows what happens
 to your body and brain when you skip sleep. [Directed by TED-Ed, narrated by
 Addison Anderson, music by Carlos Palomares].

In 1965, 17-year-old high school student, Randy Gardner stayed awake for 264 hours. That's
11 days to see how he'd cope without sleep. On the second day, his eyes stopped focusing.
Next, he lost the ability to identify objects by touch. By day three, Gardner was moody
and uncoordinated. At the end of the experiment, he was struggling to concentrate, had
trouble with short-term memory, became paranoid, and started hallucinating. Although
Gardner recovered without long-term psychological or physical damage, for others, losing
shuteye can result in hormonal imbalance, illness, and, in extreme cases, death. We're only
beginning to understand why we sleep to begin with, but we do know it's essential. Adults
need seven to eight hours of sleep a night, and adolescents need about ten. We grow sleepy
due to signals from our body telling our brain we are tired, and signals from the
environment telling us it's dark outside.

The rise in sleep-inducing chemicals, like adenosine and melatonin, send us into a light
doze that grows deeper, making our breathing and heart rate slow down and our muscles
relax. This non-REM sleep is when DNA is repaired and our bodies replenish themselves for
the day ahead. In the United States, it's estimated that 30% of adults and 66% of
adolescents are regularly sleep-deprived. This isn't just a minor inconvenience. Staying
awake can cause serious bodily harm. When we lose sleep, learning, memory, mood, and
reaction time are affected. Sleeplessness may also cause inflammation, halluciations, high
blood pressure, and it's even been linked to diabetes and obesity. In 2014, a devoted
soccer fan died after staying awake for 48 hours to watch the World Cup. While his
untimely death was due to a stroke, studies show that chronically sleeping fewer than six
hours a night increases stroke risk by four and half times compared to those getting a
consistent seven to eight hours of shuteye.

For a handful of people on the planet who carry a rare inherited genetic mutation,
sleeplessness is a daily reality. This condition, known as Fatal Familial Insomnia,
places the body in a nightmarish state of wakefulness, forbidding it from entering the
sanctuary of sleep. Within months or years, this progressively worsening condition leads
to dementia and death. How can sleep deprivation cause such immense suffering? Scientists
think the answer lies with the accumulation of waste prducts in the brain. During our
waking hours, our cells are busy using up our day's energy sources, which get broken down 
into various byproducts, including adenosine. As adenosine builds up, it increases the
urge to sleep, also known as sleep pressure. In fact, caffeine works by blocking
adenosine's receptor pathways. Other waste products also build up in the brain, and if
they're not cleared away, they collectively overload the brain and are thought to lead to
the many negative symptoms of sleep deprivation. So, what's happening in our brain when we
sleep to prevent this?

Scientists found something called the glymphatic system, a clean-up mechanism that
removes this buildup and is much more active when we're asleep. It works by using
cerebrospinal fluid to flush away toxic byproducts that accumulate between cells.
Lymphatic vessels, which serve as pathways for immune cells, have recently been
discovered in the brain, and they may also play a role in clearing out the brain's daily
waste products. While scientists continue exploring the restorative mechanisms behind
sleep, we can be sure that slipping into slumber is a necessity if we want to maintain
our health and our sanity.
