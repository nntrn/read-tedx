It was one of the strangest trials in Dutch history. The defendant in this 1947 case was
an art forger who had counterfeited millions of dollars worth of paintings. But he wasn’t
arguing his innocence— in fact, his life depended on proving that he had committed the
fraud. Like many art forgers, Han van Meegeren was an artist whose original works had
failed to bring him renown. Embittered towards the art world, van Meegeren set out to
make fools of his detractors. He learned all he could about the Old Masters— their
biographies, their techniques, and their materials. The artist he chose for his deception
 was 17th century Baroque painter Johannes Vermeer— an ambitious decision given Vermeer 
was famed for his carefully executed and technically brilliant domestic scenes. Working in
secret for six years, the forger perfected his art, copying numerous works as practice.
He mixed his own paints after researching the raw materials and pigments available in
Vermeer’s time.

He bought 17th century canvases, created his own brushes, and aged the works by applying
synthetic resin and baking them to dry and crack the paint. A forensic test could have
detected the synthetic resin. But at the time, such tests were neither advanced nor
widespread, and even today verification of a painting’s authenticity relies on the
assessment of art specialists. So it’s a matter of their subjective judgment— as well as
their reputation. And this is where van Meegeren truly outwitted the art world. From his
research, he knew historians believed Vermeer had an early period of religious painting
influenced by the Italian painter Caravaggio. The leading authority on Vermeer, Abraham
Bredius, was a huge proponent of this theory, though none of these works had surfaced. So
van Meegeren decided to make one. He called it "The Supper at Emmaus."Bredius declared van
Meegeren’s fake the masterpiece of Vermeer’s oeuvre.

Van Meegeren’s forgery was not totally up to Vermeer’s technical standards, but these
inconsistencies could be made to fit the narrative: this was an early work, produced
before the artist had come into his own. With the stamp of approval from the art world,
the fake was sold in 1937 for the equivalent of over $4 million in today’s money. The
success prompted van Meegeren to forge and sell more works through various art dealers.
As unbelievable as it may sound, the art world continued to believe in their
authenticity. When the Nazis occupied Holland during the Second World War, Hermann
Göring, one of Hitler’s top generals, sought to add a Vermeer to his collection of
artwork looted from all over Europe. Van Meegeren obliged, selling him an alleged early
Vermeer painting titled "Christ with the Adulteress."As the tide of the war turned, so
did van Meegeren’s luck. Following the Allied victory, he was arrested for delivering a
priceless piece of Dutch heritage to the Nazis— an act of treasonous collaboration
punishable by death.

To prove the painting wasn’t a national treasure, he explained step-by-step how he had
forged it. But he faced an unexpected obstacle— the very expert who had enabled his scam.
Moved to protect his reputation, Bredius defended the painting’s authenticity. With few
options left, van Meegeren set to work on a "new" Vermeer. When he presented the fake to
the court, they finally believed him. He was acquitted for collaborating with the Nazis—
and sentenced to a year imprisonment for fraud. Though there’s evidence that van Meegeren 
did, in fact, collaborate with the Nazis, he managed to convince the public that he had
tricked Göring on purpose, transforming his image into that of a folk hero who had
swindled the Nazis. Thanks to this newfound notoriety, his works became valuable in their
own right— so much so that they were later forged in turn by his own son. The same
canvases went from revered classics to despised forgeries to works of art respected for
the skill and notoriety of the forger.
