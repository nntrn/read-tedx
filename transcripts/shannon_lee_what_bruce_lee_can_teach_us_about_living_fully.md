Bruce Lee is my father, and he is best well-known as a martial artist and an action film
star, as I'm sure most of you know. He died when I was four years old, but I have a really
deep memory of him. I don't have those long-form, storied memories that you do when you're
older, but the memory that I do have is of the feeling of him. I remember his energy, his
presence, his love — the safety of it, the power of it, the radiance of it. And to me that
memory is very deep and personal. And it is the memory of the quality of his essential
nature. What a lot of people don't know about my father is that he was also a philosopher.
He had a very ever-evolving philosophy that he lived, and it is that distinction — that he
lived his philosophy and didn't just espouse his philosophy — that made him the force of
nature that he was, and still engages us today. His wisdom has salvaged me many times in
my life: when my brother died, when my heart's been broken, whenever I have faced a
challenge to my mind, my body or my spirit, the way that he expressed himself has lifted
me up.

And so I come to you today not as a researcher or an educator or a guru or even a life
coach, but as a student of Bruce Lee — as his daughter, and also as a student of my own
life. So ... my big burning question that I want you all to consider today is ... how are
you? Let me elaborate. Whenever anyone would ask my mom what my father was like, she would
say, "How he was in front of the camera, how you saw him in his films, how you saw him in
his interviews was, in fact, exactly how he was." There were not multiple Bruce Lees.
There was not public Bruce Lee and private Bruce Lee, or teacher Bruce Lee and actor Bruce
Lee and family man Bruce Lee. There was just one unified, total Bruce Lee. And that Bruce
Lee had a very deep, philosophical life practice called self-actualization. You've
probably heard that term before. It's also known as how to be yourself in the best way
possible. And that Bruce Lee said this: "When I look around, I always learn something and
that is to be always yourself, and to express yourself and have faith in
yourself.

Don't go out and find a successful personality and duplicate it, but rather start from the
very root of your being, which is 'How can I be me?'"Many of us have done some
soul-searching or at least some incessant thinking and worrying about things like our
purpose, our passion, our impact, our values and our "reason for being." And that is
sometimes considered our why. Why am I here? Why this life? What am I meant to be doing?
If we can grab a little piece of that information, it can help to ground us and root us,
and it can also point us in a direction, and typically what it points us to is our what.
What we manifest in the world, what we have. So our job, our home, our hobbies and the
like. But there's this little space in between the why and the what that often doesn't get
our full attention, and that is our ... how. How we get there and the quality of that
doing. And I want to offer that this is actually the most important part of the equation
when it comes to our personal growth, our sense of wholeness and even the long-term impact
that we make. How is the action that bridges the gap from the internal to the
external.

And bridging the gap is a very important concept for martial artists like my father. It's
how you get from point A to point B. It's how you get from here to your target under the
most vital of circumstances. And so it makes all the difference. Do you get there as an
amateur? Are you sloppy? Are you wild, chaotic, sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you're
not lucky? Or are you a warrior? Are you confident? Are you focused? Are you skilled? Are
you intuitive? Are you expressive, creative, aware? So I want to talk to you today about
your how in your life. So we do a little bit of — we spend a little time in existential
crisis over "Why am I here? What am I meant to be doing?" and we put a ton of effort into
our what — our job, our career, our partner that we have and the hobbies we pursue. But I
want us to consider that our how is the expression of our why in every what, whether we're
aware of it or not. And so let's take an example. Let's say that I have a value of
kindness.

I'm all about kindness, I feel really natural being kind, I want to see more kindness in
the world. Is that kindness — is that value in the result or is it in the doing? Are you
trying to be kind when it's hard to be kind? Can you do something you don't want to do
kindly, like fire someone? Can you leave a relationship with kindness? If kindness is the
value, then are you trying to express it in the whole spectrum of your doing — and trying
to do that? Or are you just doing it when it's easy? So I want us to think about that for
a moment and consider, you know, if we come home and we're kind and generous and loving
with our kids, but then we go to work and we are dismissive and rude to our assistant and
we treat them like a subhuman, then there is a fragmentation in the beingness of our
value. And so I want us to consider that how we are in our lives is in fact how we are.
Meaning, if I am the kind of person that walks down the street and smiles at people and
says "hi" as I walk past them on the sidewalk, then that is how I am.

But if I'm also the kind of person who makes fun of my brother every chance that I get
behind his back, that is also the kind of person that I am. And ultimately how we are
makes up the totality of the picture of who we are. And so I want to talk about how do we
unite these pieces if we have any fragmentation. I want to understand how we embody
ourselves as our one and only self. How do we actualize the whole self? My father said,
"All goals apart from the means are an illusion. There will never be means to ends — only
means. And I am means. I am what I started with and when it is all over, I will be all
that is left." So you can employ a systematic approach to training and practicing, but you
can't employ a systematic approach to actually living because life is a process not a
goal. It is a means and not an end. So "to obtain enlightenment" — and I'm going to say
self-actualize, to be self-actualized or to obtain wholeness — "emphasis should fall NOT
on the cultivation of the particular department" — all of our whats — "which then merges
into the totality of who we are as a total human being, but rather, on the total human
being that then enters into and unites those particular departments." You are your how. You
— if you have some consciousness and you want to bring some practice, if you want to step
into that warrior space around your how — how you express in every aspect of your life —
then you get to be the artist of that expression.

You get to step into that and claim it and exercise it and bring that beingness through
your doingness into your havingness. And there you will find the most profound of your
growth, you will find a sense of wholeness and ultimately, you will leave a lasting impact
on your environment. My father was his how. He applied the execution of who he was to every
aspect of his life. He was way more than that kung fu guy from the '70s. He was someone
who worked very hard at actualizing his inner self and expressing it out into the world.
And that laid the foundation for what continues to inspire us, engage us, excite us and
attract us to him. He was the embodied example of living fully. He said, "I am means." And
there are only means. So I'm going to ask you one more time. Thank you for listening, and
please consider, for you, across the spectrum of your doing, how are you? Thank
you.
