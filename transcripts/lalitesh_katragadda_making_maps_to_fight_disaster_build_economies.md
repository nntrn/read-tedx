title: Making maps to fight disaster, build economies
speaker: Lalitesh Katragadda
description: >-
 As of 2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped. This slows the delivery of
 aid after a disaster -- and hides the economic potential of unused lands and
 unknown roads. In this short talk, Google's Lalitesh Katragadda demos Map Maker,
 a group map-making tool that people around the globe are using to map their
 world.

In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar. Millions of people were in severe need of
help. The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area. But there were no maps, no
maps of roads, no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone
victims. When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London, it is hard to believe that as of
2005, only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail. The U.N.
ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world's populous faces: not having
detailed maps. But help was coming. At Google, 40 volunteers used a new software to map
120,000 kilometers of roads, 3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points. And it took
them four days. The new software they used? Google Mapmaker. Google Mapmaker is a
technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally. People have used this
software to map everything from roads to rivers, from schools to local businesses, and
video stores to the corner store. Maps matter.

Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most
developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land. For example, a
trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone. In the last year
alone, thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information,
and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable. And this was made possible by
the power of passionate users everywhere. Let's look at some of the maps being created by
users right now. So, as we speak, people are mapping the world in these 170 countries. You
can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal. And, closer to home, Chalua,
an N.G. road in Bangalore. This is the result of computational geometry, gesture
recognition, and machine learning. This is a victory of thousands of users, in hundreds of
cities, one user, one edit at a time. This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our
unmapped planet.

Welcome to the new world.
