title: Imaging at a trillion frames per second
speaker: Ramesh Raskar
description: >-
 Ramesh Raskar presents femto-photography, a new type of imaging so fast it
 visualizes the world one trillion frames per second, so detailed it shows light
 itself in motion. This technology may someday be used to build cameras that can
 look “around” corners or see inside the body without X-rays.

Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing
through an apple, and exposure just a millionth of a second. But now, 50 years later, we
can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million or a billion, but one
trillion frames per second. I present to you a new type of photography, femto-photography,
a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that can look around corners, beyond line of sight,
or see inside our body without an x-ray, and really challenge what we mean by a camera. Now
if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second — which is
several femtoseconds — I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide. And that
packet of photons, that bullet, will travel at the speed of light, and again, a million
times faster than an ordinary bullet.

Now, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle,
how will those photons shatter into this bottle? How does light look in slow motion?[Light
in Slow Motion ... 10 Billion x Slow]Now, the whole event —

Now remember, the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond —
that's how much time it takes for light to travel. But I'm slowing down in this video by a
factor of 10 billion, so you can see the light in motion.

But Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research.

Now, there's a lot going on in this movie, so let me break this down and show you what's
going on. So the pulse enters the bottle, our bullet, with a packet of photons that start
traveling through and that start scattering inside. Some of the light leaks, goes on the
table, and you start seeing these ripples of waves. Many of the photons eventually reach
the cap and then they explode in various directions. As you can see, there's a bubble of
air and it's bouncing around inside. Meanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table,
and because of the reflections at the top, you see at the back of the bottle, after
several frames, the reflections are focused. Now, if you take an ordinary bullet and let it
go the same distance and slow down the video — again, by a factor of 10 billion — do you
know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie?

A day, a week? Actually, a whole year. It'll be a very boring movie —

of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion. And what about some still-life photography? You can
watch the ripples, again, washing over the table, the tomato and the wall in the back.
It's like throwing a stone in a pond of water. I thought: this is how nature paints a
photo, one femto frame at a time, but of course our eye sees an integral composite. But if
you look at this tomato one more time, you will notice, as the light washes over the
tomato, it continues to glow. It doesn't become dark. Why is that? Because the tomato is
actually ripe, and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato, and it comes out after
several trillionths of a second. So in the future, when this femto-camera is in your
camera phone, you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe
without actually touching it.

So how did my team at MIT create this camera? Now, as photographers, you know, if you take
a short exposure photo, you get very little light. But we're going to go a billion times
faster than your shortest exposure, so you're going to get hardly any light. So what we do
is we send that bullet — that packet of photons — millions of times, and record again and
again with very clever synchronization, and from the gigabytes of data, we computationally
weave together to create those femto-videos I showed you. And we can take all that raw data
and treat it in very interesting ways. So, Superman can fly. Some other heroes can become
invisible. But what about a new power for a future superhero: To see around corners. The
idea is that we could shine some light on the door, it's going to bounce, go inside the
room, some of that is going to reflect back on the door, and then back to the camera. And
we could exploit these multiple bounces of light. And it's not science fiction.

We have actually built it. On the left, you see our femto-camera. There's a mannequin
hidden behind a wall, and we're going to bounce light off the door. So after our paper was
published in Nature Communications, it was highlighted by Nature.com, and they created
this animation.

[A laser pulse is fired]

Ramesh Raskar: We're going to fire those bullets of light, and they're going to hit this
wall, and because of the packet of the photons, they will scatter in all the directions,
and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin, which in turn will again scatter that
light, and again in turn, the door will reflect some of that scattered light. And a tiny
fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera, but most interestingly,
they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot.

And because we have a camera that can run so fast — our femto-camera — it has some unique
abilities. It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of
light. And this way, we know the distances, of course to the door, but also to the hidden
objects, but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance.

By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo, which, if you look on the screen,
doesn't really make any sense. But then we will take a lot of such pictures, dozens of
such pictures, put them together, and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light, and
from that, can we see the hidden object? Can we see it in full 3D?So this is our
reconstruction.

Now, we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road, but in the
future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the bend. Or we can
look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open
windows. Or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders,
and also for cardioscopes. But of course, because of tissue and blood, this is quite
challenging, so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about
femto-photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of
health-imaging problems. Now, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist himself, science became art —
an art of ultra-fast photography. And I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we're
collecting every time, are not just for scientific imaging. But we can also do a new form
of computational photography, with time-lapse and color coding. And we look at those
ripples.

Remember: The time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second. But
there's also something funny going on here. When you look at the ripples under the cap,
the ripples are moving away from us. The ripples should be moving towards us. What's going
on here? It turns out, because we're recording nearly at the speed of light, we have
strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this picture.

The order at which events take place in the world appears in the camera sometimes in
reversed order. So by applying the corresponding space and time warp, we can correct for
this distortion. So whether it's for photography around corners, or creating the next
generation of health imaging, or creating new visualizations, since our invention, we have
open-sourced all the data and details on our website, and our hope is that the DIY, the
creative and the research communities will show us that we should stop obsessing about the
megapixels in cameras —

and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging. It's about time. Thank
you.
