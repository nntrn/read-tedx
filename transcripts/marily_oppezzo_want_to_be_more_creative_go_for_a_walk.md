title: Want to be more creative? Go for a walk
speaker: Marily Oppezzo
description: >-
 When trying to come up with a new idea, we all have times when we get stuck. But
 according to research by behavioral and learning scientist Marily Oppezzo,
 getting up and going for a walk might be all it takes to get your creative juices
 flowing. In this fun, fast talk, she explains how walking could help you get the
 most out of your next brainstorm.

The creative process — you know this — from the first idea to the final product, is a long
process. It's super-iterative, lots of refinement, blood, sweat, tears and years. And
we're not saying you're going to go out for a walk and come back with the Sistine Chapel
in your left hand. So what frame of the creative process did we focus on? Just this first
part. Just brainstorming, coming up with a new idea. We actually ran four studies with a
variety of people. You were either walking indoors or outdoors. And all of these studies
found the same conclusion. I'm only going to tell you about one of them today. One of the
tests we used for creativity was alternate uses. In this test, you have four minutes. Your
job is to come up with as many other ways to use common everyday objects as you can think
of. So, for example, what else would you do with a key, other than to use it for opening
up a lock? Clearly, you could use it as a third eyeball for a giraffe, right?
Maybe.

That's sort of interesting, kind of new. But is it creative? So people came up with as
many ideas as they could, and we had to decide: Is this creative or not? The definition of
creativity that a lot of people go with is "appropriate novelty." For something to be
appropriate, it has to be realistic, so unfortunately, you can't use a key as an eyeball.
Boo! But "novel," the second thing, is that nobody had to have said it. So for us, it had
to be appropriate first, and then for novelty, nobody else in the entire population that
we surveyed could have said it. So you might think you could use a key to scratch
somebody's car, but if somebody else said that, you didn't get credit for it. Neither of
you did. However, only one person said this: "If you were dying and it were a murder
mystery, and you had to carve the name of the murderer into the ground with your dying
words." One person said this.

And it's a creative idea, because it's appropriate and it's novel. You either did this test
and came up with ideas while you were seated or while you were walking on a
treadmill.

They did the test twice, with different objects. Three groups: the first group sat first
and then sat again for the second test. The second group sat first and then did the second
test while walking on a treadmill. The third group — and this is interesting — they walked
on the treadmill first, and then they sat. OK, so the two groups that sat together for the
first test, they looked pretty similar to each other, and they averaged about 20 creative
ideas per person. The group that was walking on the treadmill did almost twice as well.
And they were just walking on a treadmill in a windowless room. Remember, they took the
test twice. The people who sat twice for that second test didn't get any better; practice
didn't help. But these same people who were sitting and then went on the treadmill got a
boost from walking. Here's the interesting thing. The people who were walking on the
treadmill still had a residue effect of the walking, and they were still creative
afterwards.

So the implication of this is that you should go for a walk before your next big meeting
and just start brainstorming right away. We have five tips for you that will help make this
the best effect possible. First, you want to pick a problem or a topic to brainstorm. So,
this is not the shower effect, when you're in the shower and all of a sudden, a new idea
pops out of the shampoo bottle. This is something you're thinking about ahead of time.
They're intentionally thinking about brainstorming a different perspective on the
walk. Secondly — I get asked this a lot: Is this OK while running? Well, the answer for me
is that if I were running, the only new idea I would have would be to stop running, so
...

But if running for you is a comfortable pace, good. It turns out, whatever physical
activity is not taking a lot of attention. So just walking at a comfortable pace is a good
choice. Also, you want to come up with as many ideas as you can. One key of creativity is
to not lock on that first idea. Keep going. Keep coming up with new ones, until you pick
one or two to pursue. You might worry that you don't want to write them down, because what
if you forget them? So the idea here is to speak them. Everybody was speaking their new
ideas. So you can put your headphones on and record through your phone and then just
pretend you're having a creative conversation, right? Because the act of writing your idea
down is already a filter. You're going to be like, "Is this good enough to write down?"
And then you write it down. So just speak as many as you can, record them and think about
them later. And finally: don't do this forever. Right?

If you're on the walk and that idea's not coming to you, come back to it later at another
time. I think we're coming up on a break right now, so I have an idea: Why don't you grab a
leash and take your thoughts for a walk? Thank you.
