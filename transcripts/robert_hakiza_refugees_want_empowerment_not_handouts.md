title: Refugees want empowerment, not handouts
speaker: Robert Hakiza
description: >-
 The prevailing image of where refugees live is of temporary camps in isolated
 areas -- but in reality, nearly 60 percent of them worldwide end up in urban
 areas. TED Fellow Robert Hakiza takes us inside the lives of urban refugees --
 and shows us how organizations like the one that he started can provide them with
 the skills they need to ultimately become self-sufficient.

Currently, most refugees live in the cities rather than in the refugee camps. We represent
over 60 percent of the number of refugees globally. With the majority of refugees living
in urban areas, there is a strong need for a paradigm shift and new thinking. Rather than
wasting money on building walls, it would be better to spend on programs to help refugees
to help themselves.

We always have to leave behind all our possessions. But not our skills and knowledge. If
allowed to live a productive life, refugees can help themselves and contribute to the
development of their host country. I was born in the city called Bukavu, South Kivu, in the
Democratic Republic of Congo. I am the fifth-born in a family of 12 children. My father, a
mechanic by profession, worked very hard to send me to school. Just like other young
people, I had a lot of plans and dreams. I wanted to complete my studies, get a nice job,
marry and have my own children and support my family. But this didn't happen. War in my
homeland forced me to flee to Uganda in 2008, nine years ago. My family joined a steady
exodus of refugees who settled in Uganda's capital, Kampala. In my country, I lived
already in the city, and we felt Kampala was much better than a refugee camp. Refugees in
the cities have always been denied international assistance, even after their recognition
by UNHCR in 1997.

In addition to the poverty problem we were confronted with as the local urban poor, we
were facing challenges due to our refugee status, such as a language barrier. In Congo,
the official language is French. But in Uganda, it is English. We didn't have access to
education and health. We were exposed to harassment, exploitation, intimidation and
discrimination. Humanitarian organizations mostly focused on the formal settlement in
rural areas, and there was nothing in place for us. But we didn't want handouts. We wanted
to work and support ourselves. I joined my other two colleagues in exile and set up an
organization to support other refugees. YARID — Young African Refugees for Integral
Development — began as a conversation within the Congolese community. We asked the
community how they could organize themselves to solve these challenges. The YARID programs
for support evolve in stages, progressing from soccer community, to English language to
sewing livelihoods.

The soccer changed the energy of unemployed youth and connected people from different
communities. The free English classes help empower people to engage with the Ugandan
community, allowing them to get to know their neighbors and sell wares. The vocational
training program offers livelihood skills, and with them, important opportunities for
economic self-reliance. We've seen so many families become self-sustaining. We've seen who
no longer needs our help. As YARID's programs have expanded, it has included an increasing
range of nationalities — Congolese, Rwandan, Burundian, Somalis, Ethiopian, South
Sudanese. Today, YARID has supported over 3,000 refugees across Kampala and continues
supporting more.

Refugees want empowerment, not handouts. We know our community better than anyone. We
understand the challenges and opportunities we face to become self-reliant. I know better
than anyone that initiatives created by refugees work. They need to be internationally
recognized and supported. Give us the support we deserve, and we will pay you back with
interest. Thank you so much.
