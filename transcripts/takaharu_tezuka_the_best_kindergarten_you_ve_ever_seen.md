This is a kindergarten we designed in 2007. We made this kindergarten to be a circle.
It's a kind of endless circulation on top of the roof. If you are a parent, you know that
kids love to keep making circles. This is how the rooftop looks. And why did we design
this? The principal of this kindergarten said, "No, I don't want a handrail." I said,
"It's impossible." But he insisted: "How about having a net sticking out from the edge of
the roof? So that it can catch the children falling off?" 

I said, "It's impossible."And of course, the government official said, "Of course you have
to have a handrail." But we could keep that idea around the trees. There are three trees
popping through. And we were allowed to call this rope as a handrail. But of course, rope
has nothing to do with them. They fall into the net. And you get more, and more, more.

Sometimes 40 children are around a tree. The boy on the branch, he loves the tree so he
is eating the tree. 

And at the time of an event, they sit on the edge. It looks so nice from underneath.

Feeding time. 

 

And we made the roof as low as possible, because we wanted to see children on top of the
roof, not only underneath the roof. And if the roof is too high, you see only the
ceiling. And the leg washing place — there are many kinds of water taps. You see with the
flexible tubes, you want to spray water to your friends, and the shower, and the one in
front is quite normal. But if you look at this, the boy is not washing his boots, he's
putting water into his boots. 

This kindergarten is completely open, most of the year. And there is no boundary between
inside and outside. So it means basically this architecture is a roof. And also there is
no boundary between classrooms. So there is no acoustic barrier at all. When you put many
children in a quiet box, some of them get really nervous. But in this kindergarten, there
is no reason they get nervous. Because there is no boundary. And the principal says if the
boy in the corner doesn't want to stay in the room, we let him go. He will come back
eventually, because it's a circle, it comes back. 

But the point is, in that kind of occasion, usually children try to hide somewhere. But
here, just they leave and come back. It's a natural process. And secondly, we consider
noise very important. You know that children sleep better in noise. They don't sleep in a
quiet space. And in this kindergarten, these children show amazing concentration in class.
And you know, our kind grew up in the jungle with noise. They need noise. And you know,
you can talk to your friends in a noisy bar. You are not supposed to be in silence. And you
know, these days we are trying to make everything under control. You know, it's completely
open. And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter. In summer you go
swimming. The sand is 50 degrees. And also, you should know that you are waterproof. You
never melt in rain. So, children are supposed to be outside. So that is how we should
treat them. This is how they divide classrooms. They are supposed to help teachers. They
don't.

I didn't put him in. A classroom. And a washbasin. They talk to each other around the
well. And there are always some trees in the classroom. A monkey trying to fish another
monkey from above. 

Monkeys. 

And each classroom has at least one skylight. And this is where Santa Claus comes down at
the time of Christmas. This is the annex building, right next to that oval-shaped
kindergarten. The building is only five meters tall with seven floors. And of course, the
ceiling height is very low. So you have to consider safety. So, we put our children, a
daughter and a son. They tried to go in. He hit his head. He's okay. His skull is quite
strong. He is resilient. It's my son. 

And he is trying to see if it is safe to jump off. And then we put other children. The
traffic jam is awful in Tokyo, as you know. 

The driver in front, she needs to learn how to drive. Now these days, kids need a small
dosage of danger. And in this kind of occasion, they learn to help each other. This is
society. This is the kind of opportunity we are losing these days. Now, this drawing is
showing the movement of a boy between 9:10 and 9:30. And the circumference of this
building is 183 meters. So it's not exactly small at all. And this boy did 6,000 meters in
the morning. But the surprise is yet to come. The children in this kindergarten do 4,000
meters on average. And these children have the highest athletic abilities among many
kindergartens. The principal says, "I don't train them. We leave them on top of the roof.
Just like sheep." 

They keep running. 

My point is don't control them, don't protect them too much, and they need to tumble
sometimes. They need to get some injury. And that makes them learn how to live in this
world. I think architecture is capable of changing this world, and people's lives. And
this is one of the attempts to change the lives of children. Thank you very
much.
