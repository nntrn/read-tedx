 Forget stitches -- there's a better way to close wounds. In this talk, TED Fellow
 Joe Landolina talks about his invention -- a medical gel that can instantly stop
 traumatic bleeding without the need to apply pressure. (Contains medical

I want you guys to imagine that you're a soldier running through the battlefield. Now,
you're shot in the leg with a bullet, which severs your femoral artery. Now, this bleed is
extremely traumatic and can kill you in less than three minutes. Unfortunately, by the
time that a medic actually gets to you, what the medic has on his or her belt can take
five minutes or more, with the application of pressure, to stop that type of bleed. Now,
this problem is not only a huge problem for the military, but it's also a huge problem
that's epidemic throughout the entire medical field, which is how do we actually look at
wounds and how do we stop them quickly in a way that can work with the body? So now, what
I've been working on for the last four years is to develop smart biomaterials, which are
actually materials that will work with the body, helping it to heal and helping it to
allow the wounds to heal normally. So now, before we do this, we have to take a much
closer look at actually how does the body work.

So now, everybody here knows that the body is made up of cells. So the cell is the most
basic unit of life. But not many people know what else. But it actually turns out that
your cells sit in this mesh of complicated fibers, proteins and sugars known as the
extracellular matrix. So now, the ECM is actually this mesh that holds the cells in
place, provides structure for your tissues, but it also gives the cells a home. It allows
them to feel what they're doing, where they are, and tells them how to act and how to
behave. And it actually turns out that the extracellular matrix is different from every 
single part of the body. So the ECM in my skin is different than the ECM in my liver, and
the ECM in different parts of the same organ actually vary, so it's very difficult to be
able to have a product that will react to the local extracellular matrix, which is
exactly what we're trying to do. So now, for example, think of the rainforest.

You have the canopy, you have the understory, and you have the forest floor. Now, all of
these parts of the forest are made up of different plants, and different animals call them
home. So just like that, the extracellular matrix is incredibly diverse in three
dimensions. On top of that, the extracellular matrix is responsible for all wound healing,
so if you imagine cutting the body, you actually have to rebuild this very complex ECM in
order to get it to form again, and a scar, in fact, is actually poorly formed
extracellular matrix. So now, behind me is an animation of the extracellular matrix. So as
you see, your cells sit in this complicated mesh and as you move throughout the tissue,
the extracellular matrix changes. So now every other piece of technology on the market
can only manage a two- dimensional approximation of the extracellular matrix, which means
that it doesn't fit in with the tissue itself. So when I was a freshman at NYU, what I
discovered was you could actually take small pieces of plant-derived polymers and
reassemble them onto the wound.

So if you have a bleeding wound like the one behind me, you can actually put our
material onto this, and just like Lego blocks, it'll reassemble into the local tissue. So
that means if you put it onto liver, it turns into something that looks like liver, and
if you put it onto skin, it turns into something that looks just like skin. So when you
put the gel on, it actually reassembles into this local tissue. So now, this has a whole 
bunch of applications, but basically the idea is, wherever you put this product, you're
able to reassemble into it immediately. Now, this is a simulated arterial bleed — blood
warning — at twice human artery pressure. So now, this type of bleed is incredibly
traumatic, and like I said before, would actually take five minutes or more with pressure
to be able to stop. Now, in the time that it takes me to introduce the bleed itself, our
material is able to stop that bleed, and it's because it actually goes on and works with
the body to heal, so it reassembles into this piece of meat, and then the blood actually
recognizes that that's happening, and produces fibrin, producing a very fast clot in less
than 10 seconds. So now this technology — Thank you.

So now this technology, by January, will be in the hands of veterinarians, and we're
working very diligently to try to get it into the hands of doctors, hopefully within the
next year. But really, once again, I want you guys to imagine that you are a soldier
running through a battlefield. Now, you get hit in the leg with a bullet, and instead of
bleeding out in three minutes, you pull a small pack of gel out of your belt, and with
the press of a button, you're able to stop your own bleed and you're on your way to
recovery. Thank you very much.
