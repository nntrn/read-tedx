title: What's the difference between accuracy and precision?
speaker: Matt Anticole
description: >-
 When we measure things, most people are only worried about how accurate, or how
 close to the actual value, they are. Looking at the process of measurement more
 carefully, you will see that there is another important consideration: precision.
 Matt Anticole explains what exactly precision is and how can help us to measure
 things better. [Directed by Anton Bogaty, narrated by Addison Anderson].

As the story goes, the legendary marksman William Tell was forced into a cruel challenge
by a corrupt lord. William's son was to be executed unless William could shoot an apple
off his head. William succeeded, but let's imagine two variations on the tale. In the
first variation, the lord hires a bandit to steal William's trusty crossbow, so he is
forced to borrow an inferior one from a peasant. However, the borrowed crossbow isn't
adjusted perfectly, and William finds that his practice shots cluster in a tight spread 
beneath the bullseye. Fortunately, he has time to correct for it before it's too late.
Variation two: William begins to doubt his skills in the long hours before the challenge
and his hand develops a tremor. His practice shots still cluster around the apple but in a
random pattern. Occasionally, he hits the apple, but with the wobble, there is no
guarantee of a bullseye. He must settle his nervous hand and restore the certainty in his
aim to save his son.

At the heart of these variations are two terms often used interchangeably: accuracy and
precision. The distinction between the two is actually critical for many scientific
endeavours. Accuracy involves how close you come to the correct result. Your accuracy
improves with tools that are calibrated correctly and that you're well-trained on.
Precision, on the other hand, is how consistently you can get that result using the same
method. Your precision improves with more finely incremented tools that require less
estimation. The story of the stolen crossbow was one of precision without accuracy.
William got the same wrong result each time he fired. The variation with the shaky hand
was one of accuracy without precision. William's bolts clustered around the correct
result, but without certainty of a bullseye for any given shot. You can probably get away 
with low accuracy or low precision in everyday tasks.

But engineers and researchers often require accuracy on microscopic levels with a high
certainty of being right every time. Factories and labs increase precision through better
equipment and more detailed procedures. These improvements can be expensive, so managers
must decide what the acceptable uncertainty for each project is. However, investments in
precision can take us beyond what was previously possible, even as far as Mars. It may
surprise you that NASA does not know exactly where their probes are going to touch down on
another planet. Predicting where they will land requires extensive calculations fed by
measurements that don't always have a precise answer. How does the Martian atmosphere's
density change at different elevations? What angle will the probe hit the atmosphere at?
What will be the speed of the probe upon entry? Computer simulators run thousands of
different landing scenarios, mixing and matching values for all of the
variables.

Weighing all the possibilities, the computer spits out the potential area of impact in
the form of a landing ellipse. In 1976, the landing ellipse for the Mars Viking Lander was
62 x 174 miles, nearly the area of New Jersey. With such a limitation, NASA had to ignore
many interesting but risky landing areas. Since then, new information about the Martian
atmosphere, improved spacecraft technology, and more powerful computer simulations have
drastically reduced uncertainty. In 2012, the landing ellipse for the Curiosity Lander
was only 4 miles wide by 12 miles long, an area more than 200 times smaller than
Viking's. This allowed NASA to target a specific spot in Gale Crater, a previously
un-landable area of high scientific interest. While we ultimately strive for accuracy,
precision reflects our certainty of reliably achieving it. With these two principles in
mind, we can shoot for the stars and be confident of hitting them every
time.
