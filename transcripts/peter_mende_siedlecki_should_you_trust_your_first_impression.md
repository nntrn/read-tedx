title: Should you trust your first impression?
speaker: Peter Mende-Siedlecki
description: >-
 You can't help it; sometimes, you just get a bad feeling about someone that's
 hard to shake. So, what's happening in your brain when you make that critical
 (and often lasting) first judgment? Peter Mende-Siedlecki shares the social
 psychology of first impressions -- and why they may indicate that, deep down,
 people are basically good. [Directed by TOGETHER: Words+Pictures for Art &
 Culture, narrated by Addison Anderson].

Imagine you're at a football game when this obnoxious guy sits next to you. He's loud, he
spills his drink on you, and he makes fun of your team. Days later, you're walking in the
park when suddenly it starts to pour rain. Who should show up at your side to offer you an
umbrella? The same guy from the football game. Do you change your mind about him based on
this second encounter, or do you go with your first impression and write him off? Research
in social psychology suggests that we're quick to form lasting impressions of others based
on their behaviors. We manage to do this with little effort, inferring stable character
traits from a single behavior, like a harsh word or a clumsy step. Using our impressions
as guides, we can accurately predict how people are going to behave in the future. Armed
with the knowledge the guy from the football game was a jerk the first time you met him,
you might expect more of the same down the road.

If so, you might choose to avoid him the next time you see him. That said, we can change
our impressions in light of new information. Behavioral researchers have identified
consistent patterns that seem to guide this process of impression updating. On one hand,
learning very negative, highly immoral information about someone typically has a stronger
impact than learning very positive, highly moral information. So, unfortunately for our
new friend from the football game, his bad behavior at the game might outweigh his good
behavior at the park. Research suggests that this bias occurs because immoral behaviors
are more diagnostic, or revealing, of a person's true character. Okay, so by this logic,
bad is always stronger than good when it comes to updating. Well, not necessarily. Certain
types of learning don't seem to lead to this sort of negativity bias. When learning about
another person's abilities and competencies, for instance, this bias flips.

It's actually the positive information that gets weighted more heavily. Let's go back to
that football game. If a player scores a goal, it ultimately has a stronger impact on your
impression of their skills than if they miss the net. The two sides of the updating story
are ultimately quite consistent. Overall, behaviors that are perceived as being less
frequent are also the ones that people tend to weigh more heavily when forming and
updating impressions, highly immoral actions and highly competent actions. So, what's
happening at the level of the brain when we're updating our impressions? Using fMRI, or
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, researchers have identified an extended network of
brain regions that respond to new information that's inconsistent with initial
impressions. These include areas typically associated with social cognition, attention,
and cognitive control. Moreover, when updating impressions based on people's behaviors,
activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus
correlates with perceptions of how frequently those behaviors occur in daily
life.

In other words, the brain seems to be tracking low-level, statistical properties of
behavior in order to make complex decisions regarding other people's character. It needs
to decide is this person's behavior typical or is it out of the ordinary? In the situation
with the obnoxious-football-fan-turned-good-samaritan, your brain says, "Well, in my
experience, pretty much anyone would lend someone their umbrella, but the way this guy
acted at the football game, that was unusual." And so, you decide to go with your first
impression. There's a good moral in this data: your brain, and by extension you, might
care more about the very negative, immoral things another person has done compared to the
very positive, moral things, but it's a direct result of the comparative rarity of those
bad behaviors. We're more used to people being basically good, like taking time to help a
stranger in need. In this context, bad might be stronger than good, but only because good
is more plentiful.

Think about the last time you judged someone based on their behavior, especially a time
when you really feel like you changed your mind about someone. Was the behavior that
caused you to update your impression something you'd expect anyone to do, or was it
something totally out of the ordinary?
