title: Can animals be deceptive?
speaker: Eldridge Adams
description: >-
 A male firefly emits a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a female will respond
 and mate with him. A female from a different species mimics his patterns: by
 tricking the male, she lures him in -- and turns him into a meal. Where else do
 we see this kind of trickery in the animal kingdom? Eldridge Adams details the
 surprising complexity of how animals manipulate predators, prey and their rivals.

A male firefly glows above a field on a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing
flashes. He hopes a nearby female will respond with her own lightshow and mate with him.
Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans. A female from a different
species mimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with her promise of
partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal. He’s been
deceived. Behavioral biologists have identified three defining hallmarks of deception by
non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t
simply be an accident. In this case we know that the predatory firefly’s signal isn’t an
accident because she flexibly adjusts her flash pattern to match males of different
species. Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature? Camouflage is a
good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples of animal trickery.

The leaf-tailed gecko and the octopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces on
which they rest. Other animals use mimicry to protect themselves. Harmless scarlet
kingsnakes have evolved red, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous 
eastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings these markings convey. Even
some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like female wasps to
attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant. Some of these animals benefit by
having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited to their environments. But in
other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate the reactions of other animals and to
adjust its behavior accordingly. Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its
colors to match its surroundings. Dwarf chameleons color-match their environments more
closely when they see a bird predator rather than a snake– birds, after all, have better
color vision. One of the more fascinating examples of animal deception comes from the
fork-tailed drongo.

This bird sits atop tall trees in the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for
predators and calling when it senses a threat. That sends meerkats, pied babblers, and
others dashing for cover. But the drongo will also sound a false alarm when those other
species have captured prey. As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down to
steal their catches. This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos with
much of their food. There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members 
of their own species, but that happens too. Consider the mantis shrimp. Like other
crustaceans, it molts as it grows, which leaves its soft body vulnerable to attack. But
it’s still driven to protect its home against rivals. So it has become a masterful
bluffer. Despite being fragile, a newly molted shrimp is actually more likely to threaten
intruders, spreading the large limbs it usually uses to strike or stab its
opponents.

And that works – bluffers are more likely to keep their homes than non-bluffers. In its
softened condition, a mantis shrimp couldn’t withstand a fight– which is why we can be
confident that its behavior is a bluff. Biologists have even noticed that its bluffs are
tactical: newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely to bluff against smaller rivals, who
are especially likely to be driven away. It would seem that instead of just threatening
reflexively, the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the situation and predicting others’
behavior, to get the best result. So we know that animals can deceive, but do they do so
with intent? That’s a difficult question, and many scientists think we'll never be able
to answer it. We can't observe animals’ internal thoughts. But we don’t need to know what
an animal is thinking in order to detect deception. By watching behavior and its
outcomes, we learn that animals manipulate predators, prey, and rivals, and that their
capacity for deception can be surprisingly complex.
