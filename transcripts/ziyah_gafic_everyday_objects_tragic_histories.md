title: Everyday objects, tragic histories
speaker: Ziyah Gafić
description: >-
 Ziyah Gafić photographs everyday objects—watches, shoes, glasses. But these
 images are deceptively simple; the items in them have been exhumed from the mass
 graves of the Bosnian War. Gafić, a TED Fellow and Sarajevo native, is
 photographing every item from these graves in order to create a living archive of
 the identities of those lost.

These are simple objects: clocks, keys, combs, glasses. They are the things the victims of
genocide in Bosnia carried with them on their final journey. We are all familiar with
these mundane, everyday objects. The fact that some of the victims carried personal items
such as toothpaste and a toothbrush is a clear sign they had no idea what was about to
happen to them. Usually, they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners
of war. These items have been recovered from numerous mass graves across my homeland, and
as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies from newly discovered mass graves, 20 years
after the war. And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered. During the four years
of conflict that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s, approximately 30,000
citizens, mainly civilians, went missing, presumed killed, and another 100,000 were killed
during combat operations.

Most of them were killed either in the early days of the war or towards the end of the
hostilities, when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica fell into the hands of the Serb army. The
international criminal tribunal delivered a number of sentences for crimes against
humanity and genocide. Genocide is a systematic and deliberate destruction of a racial,
political, religious or ethnic group. As much as genocide is about killing. It is also
about destroying their property, their cultural heritage, and ultimately the very notion
that they ever existed. Genocide is not only about the killing; it is about the denied
identity. There are always traces — no such thing as a perfect crime. There are always
remnants of the perished ones that are more durable than their fragile bodies and our
selective and fading memory of them. These items are recovered from numerous mass graves,
and the main goal of this collection of the items is a unique process of identifying those
who disappeared in the killings, the first act of genocide on European soil since the
Holocaust.

Not a single body should remain undiscovered or unidentified. Once recovered, these items
that the victims carried with them on their way to execution are carefully cleaned,
analyzed, catalogued and stored. Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags
just like the ones you see on CSI. These objects are used as a forensic tool in visual
identification of the victims, but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence
in the ongoing war crimes trials. Survivors are occasionally called to try to identify
these items physically, but physical browsing is extremely difficult, an ineffective and
painful process. Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers are done with these objects,
they become orphans of the narrative. Many of them get destroyed, believe it or not, or
they get simply shelved, out of sight and out of mind. I decided a few years ago to
photograph every single exhumed item in order to create a visual archive that survivors
could easily browse.

As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community. I like to move beyond raising
awareness. And in this case, someone may recognize these items or at least their
photographs will remain as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder of what happened.
Photography is about empathy, and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy. In
this case, I am merely a tool, a forensic, if you like, and the result is a photography
that is as close as possible of being a document. Once all the missing persons are
identified, only decaying bodies in their graves and these everyday items will remain. In
all their simplicity, these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims,
the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed. Thank you very
much.
