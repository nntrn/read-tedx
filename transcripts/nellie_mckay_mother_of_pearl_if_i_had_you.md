♫ Feminists don't have a sense of humor. ♫♫ Feminists just want to be alone — boo hoo,
hoo, hoo. ♫♫ Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors. ♫♫ They have a tumor on their funny
bone. ♫♫ They say child molestation isn't funny — ha, ha, ha, ha. ♫♫ Rape and
degradation's just a crime — lighten up, ladies. ♫♫ Rampant prostitution's sex for money —
what’s wrong with that? ♫♫ Can't these chicks do anything but whine? ♫♫ Dance break! Da,
da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. ♫♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. ♫♫ Woo-hoo! ♫♫ Da,
da, da, da, da, da, da, da — ♫♫ yeah, take it off. ♫♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,
dum. ♫♫ They say cheap objectification isn’t witty — it’s hot! ♫♫ Equal work and wages
worth the fight — ♫♫ sing us a new one. ♫♫ On-demand abortion every city — OK, but no gun
control. ♫♫ Won’t these women ever get a life? ♫♫ Feminists don’t have a sense of humor —
poor Hillary. ♫♫ Feminists and vegetarians — make mine a Big Mac. ♫♫ Feminists spread
vicious lies and rumors.

♫♫ They're far too sensitive to ever be a ham, ♫♫ that's why these feminists just need to
find a man. ♫♫ Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. ♫I’m Dennis Kucinich and I approved
this message. Thank you. 

Thank you. 

Thank you. I asked my mother, you know, should I say anything in support of anyone? And she
said, "Oh no! Just dis everybody, except Ralph Nader."

♫ I could show the world how to smile, ♫♫ I could be glad all of the while. ♫♫ I could
turn the gray skies to blue, if I had you. ♫♫ I could leave the old days behind, ♫♫ leave
all my pals, I’d never mind. ♫♫ I could start my life all anew, if I had you. ♫♫ I could
climb the snow-capped mountains, ♫♫ sail the mighty ocean wide. ♫♫ I could cross the
burning desert, if I had you by my side. ♫♫ I could be a king, dear, uncrowned, humble or
poor, rich or renowned. ♫♫ There is nothing I couldn’t do, if I had you. ♫Thank you. Well,
thank you so much.
