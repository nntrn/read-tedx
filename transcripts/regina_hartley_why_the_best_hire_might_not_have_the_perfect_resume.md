title: Why the best hire might not have the perfect resume
speaker: Regina Hartley
description: >-
 Given the choice between a job candidate with a perfect resume and one who has
 fought through difficulty, human resources executive Regina Hartley always gives
 the "Scrapper" a chance. As someone who grew up with adversity, Hartley knows
 that those who flourish in the darkest of spaces are empowered with the grit to
 persist in an ever-changing workplace. "Choose the underestimated contender,
 whose secret weapons are passion and purpose," she says. "Hire the Scrapper."

Your company launches a search for an open position. The applications start rolling in,
and the qualified candidates are identified. Now the choosing begins. Person A: Ivy
League, 4.0, flawless resume, great recommendations. All the right stuff. Person B: state
school, fair amount of job hopping, and odd jobs like cashier and singing waitress. But
remember — both are qualified. So I ask you: who are you going to pick? My colleagues and I
created very official terms to describe two distinct categories of candidates. We call A
"the Silver Spoon," the one who clearly had advantages and was destined for success. And
we call B "the Scrapper," the one who had to fight against tremendous odds to get to the
same point. You just heard a human resources director refer to people as Silver Spoons and
Scrappers —

which is not exactly politically correct and sounds a bit judgmental. But before my human
resources certification gets revoked —

let me explain. A resume tells a story. And over the years, I've learned something about
people whose experiences read like a patchwork quilt, that makes me stop and fully
consider them before tossing their resumes away. A series of odd jobs may indicate
inconsistency, lack of focus, unpredictability. Or it may signal a committed struggle
against obstacles. At the very least, the Scrapper deserves an interview. To be clear, I
don't hold anything against the Silver Spoon; getting into and graduating from an elite
university takes a lot of hard work and sacrifice. But if your whole life has been
engineered toward success, how will you handle the tough times? One person I hired felt
that because he attended an elite university, there were certain assignments that were
beneath him, like temporarily doing manual labor to better understand an operation.
Eventually, he quit. But on the flip side, what happens when your whole life is destined
for failure and you actually succeed? I want to urge you to interview the
Scrapper.

I know a lot about this because I am a Scrapper. Before I was born, my father was
diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and he couldn't hold a job in spite of his
brilliance. Our lives were one part "Cuckoo's Nest," one part "Awakenings" and one part "A
Beautiful Mind."

I'm the fourth of five children raised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood in
Brooklyn, New York. We never owned a home, a car, a washing machine, and for most of my
childhood, we didn't even have a telephone. So I was highly motivated to understand the
relationship between business success and Scrappers, because my life could easily have
turned out very differently. As I met successful business people and read profiles of
high-powered leaders, I noticed some commonality. Many of them had experienced early
hardships, anywhere from poverty, abandonment, death of a parent while young, to learning
disabilities, alcoholism and violence. The conventional thinking has been that trauma
leads to distress, and there's been a lot of focus on the resulting dysfunction. But
during studies of dysfunction, data revealed an unexpected insight: that even the worst
circumstances can result in growth and transformation.

A remarkable and counterintuitive phenomenon has been discovered, which scientists call
Post Traumatic Growth. In one study designed to measure the effects of adversity on
children at risk, among a subset of 698 children who experienced the most severe and
extreme conditions, fully one-third grew up to lead healthy, successful and productive
lives. In spite of everything and against tremendous odds, they succeeded. One-third. Take
this resume. This guy's parents give him up for adoption. He never finishes college. He
job-hops quite a bit, goes on a sojourn to India for a year, and to top it off, he has
dyslexia. Would you hire this guy? His name is Steve Jobs. In a study of the world's most
highly successful entrepreneurs, it turns out a disproportionate number have dyslexia. In
the US, 35 percent of the entrepreneurs studied had dyslexia. What's remarkable — among
those entrepreneurs who experience post traumatic growth, they now view their learning
disability as a desirable difficulty which provided them an advantage because they became
better listeners and paid greater attention to detail.

They don't think they are who they are in spite of adversity, they know they are who they
are because of adversity. They embrace their trauma and hardships as key elements of who
they've become, and know that without those experiences, they might not have developed the
muscle and grit required to become successful. One of my colleagues had his life completely
upended as a result of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in 1966. At age 13, his parents
were relocated to the countryside, the schools were closed and he was left alone in
Beijing to fend for himself until 16, when he got a job in a clothing factory. But instead
of accepting his fate, he made a resolution that he would continue his formal education.
Eleven years later, when the political landscape changed, he heard about a highly
selective university admissions test. He had three months to learn the entire curriculum
of middle and high school.

So, every day he came home from the factory, took a nap, studied until 4am, went back to
work and repeated this cycle every day for three months. He did it, he succeeded. His
commitment to his education was unwavering, and he never lost hope. Today, he holds a
master's degree, and his daughters each have degrees from Cornell and Harvard. Scrappers
are propelled by the belief that the only person you have full control over is yourself.
When things don't turn out well, Scrappers ask, "What can I do differently to create a
better result?" Scrappers have a sense of purpose that prevents them from giving up on
themselves, kind of like if you've survived poverty, a crazy father and several muggings,
you figure, "Business challenges? —

Really? Piece of cake. I got this."

And that reminds me — humor. Scrappers know that humor gets you through the tough times,
and laughter helps you change your perspective. And finally, there are relationships.
People who overcome adversity don't do it alone. Somewhere along the way, they find people
who bring out the best in them and who are invested in their success. Having someone you
can count on no matter what is essential to overcoming adversity. I was lucky. In my first
job after college, I didn't have a car, so I carpooled across two bridges with a woman who
was the president's assistant. She watched me work and encouraged me to focus on my future
and not dwell on my past. Along the way I've met many people who've provided me brutally
honest feedback, advice and mentorship. These people don't mind that I once worked as a
singing waitress to help pay for college.

I'll leave you with one final, valuable insight. Companies that are committed to diversity
and inclusive practices tend to support Scrappers and outperform their peers. According to
DiversityInc, a study of their top 50 companies for diversity outperformed the S&P 500 by
25 percent. So back to my original question. Who are you going to bet on: Silver Spoon or
Scrapper? I say choose the underestimated contender, whose secret weapons are passion and
purpose. Hire the Scrapper.
