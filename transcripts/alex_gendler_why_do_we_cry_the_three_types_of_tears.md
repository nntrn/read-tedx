title: Why do we cry? The three types of tears
speaker: Alex Gendler
description: >-
 Whether we cry during a sad movie, while chopping onions, or completely
 involuntarily, our eyes are constantly producing tears. Alex Gendler tracks a
 particularly watery day in the life of Iris (the iris) as she cycles through
 basal, reflex and emotional tears. [Directed by The Moving Company Animation
 Studio, narrated by Addison Anderson].

Our story is about a girl named Iris. Iris is very sensitive. (Bird cawing) So much that
she is always in tears. She cries when she's sad, when she's happy, (Godzilla roars) and
even tears up when things just get to her. She has special lacrimal glands to make new
tears and special tubes, called lacrimal puncta, to drain old ones away. And she cries so
much that she goes through ten ounces of tears per day, thirty gallons a year! In fact, if
you look closely, you'll see that she's crying a little bit all the time. The basal tears
that Iris constantly produces form a thin coating of three layers that cover her and keep
dirt and debris away. Right next to Iris is the mucus layer, which keeps the whole thing
fastened to her. On top of it is the aqueous layer, which keeps Iris hydrated, repels
invasive bacteria, and protects her skin, or cornea, from damage. And, finally, there is
the lipid layer, an oily outer film that keeps the surface smooth for Iris to see through,
and prevents the other layers from evaporating.

Normally, Iris goes about her day without really noticing the basal tears doing their
thing. That's kind of their whole point. But one day, she meets a girl named Onion. Iris
is immediately smitten. Onion looks gorgeous in her bright purple jacket, and she smells
terrific. So, Iris invites Onion to her house for dinner. But when she comes in and takes
off her jacket, something terrible happens. You see, when Onion's jacket is removed, a
chemical reaction happens, converting the sulfoxides that make her smell so great into
sulfenic acid, which then becomes a nasty substance with a long name: syn-Propanethial
S-oxide. The gas stings Iris, and suddenly, she can't help it, she starts weeping
uncontrollably. These reflex tears are different from the basal tears that Iris is used
to. Because they're designed to wash away harmful substances, or particles, they're
released in much larger amounts, and their aqueous layer contains more antibodies to stop
any microorganisms that may be trying to get in, as well.

Both Iris and Onion are devastated. They know they can't continue their relationship if
Iris is going to hurt and cry every time Onion takes off her jacket. So, they decide to
break up. As Onion walks out the door, Iris stops crying. And immediately starts again.
Only now, she's not crying reflex tears but emotional tears. When someone is either too
sad or too happy, it feels like a loss of control, which can be dangerous. So, emotional
tears are sent in to stabilize the mood as quickly as possible, along with other physical
reactions, such as an increased heart rate and slower breathing. But scientists still
aren't sure exactly how or why the tears themselves are helpful. They may be a social
mechanism to elicit sympathy or show submission. But some studies have also found that
emotional tears contain higher levels of stress hormones, such as ACTH and enkephalin, an
endorphin and natural pain killer.

In this case, emotional tears are also directly calming Iris down, as well as signaling
her emotional state to others. Sorry things didn't work out with Onion, Iris, but don't
worry. As long as you have all three kinds of tears working to keep you balanced and
healthy, it will get better. You'll see.
