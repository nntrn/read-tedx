When I was a child growing up in Maine, one of my favorite things to do was to look for
sand dollars on the seashores of Maine, because my parents told me it would bring me luck.
But you know, these shells, they're hard to find. They're covered in sand, they're
difficult to see. However, over time, I got used to looking for them. I started seeing
shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them. This grew into a passion for finding
things, a love for the past and archaeology. And eventually, when I started studying
Egyptology, I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn't enough. Because all of
the sudden, in Egypt, my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred
miles long, next to the Nile. And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities. This is
really what brought me to using satellite imagery. For trying to map the past, I knew that
I had to see differently. So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using
the infrared.

This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called Mendes. And the site visibly
appears brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it, all of the sudden, using
false color, the site appears as bright pink. What you are seeing are the actual chemical
changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient
Egyptians. What I want to share with you today is how we've used satellite data to find an
ancient Egyptian city, called Itjtawy, missing for thousands of years. Itjtawy was ancient
Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, at a period of time called the Middle
Kingdom, about four thousand years ago. The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt, and
the site is really important, because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great
renaissance for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion. Egyptologists have always
known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who
built it, indicated within the red circles here, but somewhere within this massive flood
plain.

This area is huge — it's four miles by three miles in size. The Nile used to flow right
next to the city of Itjtawy, and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the
east, it covered over the city. So, how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape?
Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack,
blindfolded, wearing baseball mitts.

So what we did is we used NASA topography data to map out the landscape, very subtle
changes. We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow. But you can see in more
detail, and even more interesting, this very slight raised area seen within the circle up
here which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy. So we
collaborated with Egyptian scientists to do coring work, which you see here. When I say
coring, it's like ice coring, but instead of layers of climate change, you're looking for
layers of human occupation. And, five meters down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we
found a dense layer of pottery. What this shows is that at this possible location of
Itjtawy, five meters down, we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years, dating
to the Middle Kingdom, dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is. We also
found work stone — carnelian, quartz and agate that shows that there was a jeweler's
workshop here.

These might not look like much, but when you think about the most common stones used in
jewelry from the Middle Kingdom, these are the stones that were used. So, we have a dense
layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site. We also have evidence of an
elite jeweler's workshop, showing that whatever was there was a very important city. No
Itjtawy was here yet, but we're going to be returning to the site in the near future to
map it out. And even more importantly, we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use
of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well. So I
wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom — it was probably written at
the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago. "Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all
callings. There's nothing like it in the land." So as it turns out, TED was not founded in
1984 AD.

Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC at a not-lost-for-long city, found from above. It
certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective. Thank you very
much.

Thank you.
