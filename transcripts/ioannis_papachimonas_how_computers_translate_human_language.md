 Is a universal translator possible in real life? We already have many programs
 that claim to be able to take a word, sentence, or entire book in one language
 and translate it into almost any other. The reality, however, is a bit more

 explains why they often get a bit mixed up. [Directed by Peyton Skyler, narrated

How is it that so many intergalactic species in movies and TV just happen to speak
perfect English? The short answer is that no one wants to watch a starship crew spend
years compiling an alien dictionary. But to keep things consistent, the creators of Star
Trek and other science-fiction worlds have introduced the concept of a universal
translator, a portable device that can instantly translate between any languages. So is a
universal translator possible in real life? We already have many programs that claim to
do just that, taking a word, sentence, or entire book in one language and translating it
into almost any other, whether it's modern English or Ancient Sanskrit. And if translation
were just a matter of looking up words in a dictionary, these programs would run circles
around humans. The reality, however, is a bit more complicated. A rule-based translation
program uses a lexical database, which includes all the words you'd find in a dictionary
and all grammatical forms they can take, and set of rules to recognize the basic
linguistic elements in the input language.

For a seemingly simple sentence like, "The children eat the muffins," the program first
parses its syntax, or grammatical structure, by identifying the children as the subject,
and the rest of the sentence as the predicate consisting of a verb "eat," and a direct
object "the muffins." It then needs to recognize English morphology, or how the language
can be broken down into its smallest meaningful units, such as the word muffin and the
suffix "s," used to indicate plural. Finally, it needs to understand the semantics, what
the different parts of the sentence actually mean. To translate this sentence properly,
the program would refer to a different set of vocabulary and rules for each element of the
target language. But this is where it gets tricky. The syntax of some languages allows
words to be arranged in any order, while in others, doing so could make the muffin eat the
child. Morphology can also pose a problem.

Slovene distinguishes between two children and three or more using a dual suffix absent 
in many other languages, while Russian's lack of definite articles might leave you
wondering whether the children are eating some particular muffins, or just eat muffins in
general. Finally, even when the semantics are technically correct, the program might miss
their finer points, such as whether the children "mangiano" the muffins, or "divorano"
them. Another method is statistical machine translation, which analyzes a database of
books, articles, and documents that have already been translated by humans. By finding
matches between source and translated text that are unlikely to occur by chance, the
program can identify corresponding phrases and patterns, and use them for future
translations. However, the quality of this type of translation depends on the size of
the initial database and the availability of samples for certain languages or styles of
writing.

The difficulty that computers have with the exceptions, irregularities and shades of
meaning that seem to come instinctively to humans has led some researchers to believe that
our understanding of language is a unique product of our biological brain structure. In
fact, one of the most famous fictional universal translators, the Babel fish from "The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", is not a machine at all but a small creature that
translates the brain waves and nerve signals of sentient species through a form of
telepathy. For now, learning a language the old fashioned way will still give you better
results than any currently available computer program. But this is no easy task, and the
sheer number of languages in the world, as well as the increasing interaction between the
people who speak them, will only continue to spur greater advances in automatic
translation. Perhaps by the time we encounter intergalactic life forms, we'll be able to
communicate with them through a tiny gizmo, or we might have to start compiling that
dictionary, after all.
