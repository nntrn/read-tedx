Claps of thunder and flashes of lightning illuminate a swelling sea, as a ship buckles
beneath the waves. This is no ordinary storm, but a violent and vengeful tempest, and
it sets the stage for Shakespeare’s most enigmatic play. As the skies clear, we are
invited into a world that seems far removed from our own, but is rife with familiar
concerns about freedom, power, and control. The Tempest is set on a desert island, exposed
to the elements and ruled with magic and might by Prospero, the exiled Duke of Milan.
Betrayed by his brother Antonio, Prospero has been marooned on the island for twelve
years with his daughter Miranda and his beloved books. In this time he’s learned the 
magic of the island and uses it to harness its elementary spirits. He also rules over the
island’s only earthly inhabitant, the dejected and demonized Caliban. But after years of
plotting revenge, Prospero’s foe is finally in sight.

With the help of the fluttering sprite Ariel, the magician destroys his brother’s ship
and washes its sailors ashore. Prospero’s plotting even extends to his daughter’s love
life, whom he plans to fall for stranded prince Ferdinand. And as Prospero and Ariel
close in on Antonio, Caliban joins forces with some drunken sailors, who hatch a comic
plot to take the island. The play strips society down to its basest desires, with each
faction in hot pursuit of power- be it over the land, other people, or their own destiny.
But Shakespeare knows that power is always a moving target; and as he reveals these
characters’ dark histories, we begin to wonder if this vicious cycle will ever
end. Although Prospero was wronged by Antonio, he has long inflicted his own abuses on the
island, hoarding its magical properties and natural re-sources for himself. Caliban
especially resents this takeover. The son of Sycorax, a witch who previously ruled the
island, he initially helped the exiles find their footing.

But he’s since become their slave, and rants with furious regret: “And then I loved thee,/
And showed thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle/ The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place
 and fertile./ Cursed be I that did so!”With his thunderous language and seething anger,
Caliban constantly reminds Prospero of what came before: this island’s mine by Sycorax my
mother, Which thou takest from me. Yet Sycorax also abused the island, and imprisoned
Ariel until Prospero released him. Now Ariel spends the play hoping to repay his debt and
earn his freedom, while Caliban is enslaved indefinitely, or at least as long as Prospero
is in charge. For these reasons and many more, The Tempest has often been read as an
exploration of colonialism, and the moral dilemmas that come with en-counters of “brave
new world(s)." Questions of agency and justice hang over the play: is Caliban the rightful
 master of the land? Will Ariel flutter free?

 And is Prospero the mighty overseer- or is there some deeper magic at work, beyond any
one character's grasp? Throughout the play, Ariel constantly reminds Prospero of the
freedom he is owed. But the question lingers of whether the invader will be able to
relinquish his grip. The question of ending one’s reign is particularly potent given that
The Tempest is believed to be Shakespeare’s final play. In many ways Prospero’s actions
echo that of the great entertainer him-self, who hatched elaborate plots, maneuvered those
around him, and cast a spell over characters and audience alike. But by the end of his
grand performance of power and control, Prospero’s final lines see him humbled by his
audience - and the power that they hold over his creations. "With the help of your good
hands./ Gentle breath of yours my sails/ Must fill or else my project fails,/ Which was to
please." This evokes Shakespeare’s own role as the great entertainer who surrenders
himself, ultimately, to our applause.
