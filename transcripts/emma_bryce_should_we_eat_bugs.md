title: Should we eat bugs?
speaker: Emma Bryce
description: >-
 What's tasty, abundant and high in protein? Bugs! Although less common outside
 the tropics, entomophagy, the practice of eating bugs, was once extremely
 widespread throughout cultures. You may feel icky about munching on insects, but
 they feed about 2 billion people each day (Mmm, fried tarantulas). They also hold
 promise for food security and the environment. Emma Bryce makes a compelling case
 for dining on bugs. [Directed by NEIGHBOR, narrated by Addison Anderson].

[Why don't we eat bugs?] For centuries, people have consumed bugs, everything from beetles
to caterpillars, locusts, grasshoppers, termites, and dragonflies. The practice even has a
name: entomophagy. Early hunter-gatherers probably learned from animals that foraged for
protein-rich insects and followed suit. As we evolved and bugs became part of our dietary
tradition, they fulfilled the role of both staple food and delicacy. In ancient Greece,
cicadas were considered luxury snacks. And even the Romans found beetle larvae to be
scrumptious. Why have we lost our taste for bugs? The reason for our rejection is
historical, and the story probably begins around 10,000 BC in the Fertile Crescent, a
place in the Middle East that was a major birthplace of agriculture. Back then, our
once-nomadic ancestors began to settle in the Crescent. And as they learned to farm crops
and domesticate animals there, attitudes changed, rippling outwards towards Europe and the
rest of the Western world.

As farming took off, people might have spurned bugs as mere pests that destroyed their
crops. Populations grew, and the West became urbanized, weakening connections with our
foraging past. People simply forgot their bug-rich history. Today, for people not
accustomed to entomophagy, bugs are just an irritant. They sting and bite and infest our
food. We feel an "ick factor" associated with them and are disgusted by the prospect of
cooking insects. Almost 2,000 insect species are turned into food, forming a big part of
everyday diets for two billion people around the world. Countries in the tropics are the
keenest consumers, because culturally, it's acceptable. Species in those regions are also
large, diverse, and tend to congregate in groups or swarms that make them easy to harvest.
Take Cambodia in Southeast Asia where huge tarantulas are gathered, fried, and sold in the
marketplace. In southern Africa, the juicy mopane worm is a dietary staple, simmered in a
spicy sauce or eaten dried and salted.

And in Mexico, chopped jumiles are toasted with garlic, lemon, and salt. Bugs can be eaten
whole to make up a meal or ground into flour, powder, and paste to add to food. But it's
not all about taste. They're also healthy. In fact, scientists say entomophagy could be a
cost-effective solution for developing countries that are food insecure. Insects can
contain up to 80% protein, the body's vital building blocks, and are also high in
energy-rich fat, fiber, and micronutrients like vitamins and minerals. Did you know that
most edible insects contain the same amount or even more mineral iron than beef, making
them a huge, untapped resource when you consider that iron deficiency is currently the
most common nutritional problem in the world? The mealworm is another nutritious example.
The yellow beetle larvae are native to America and easy to farm. They have a high vitamin
content, loads of healthy minerals, and can contain up to 50% protein, almost as much as
in an equivalent amount of beef.

To cook, simply saut√© in butter and salt or roast and drizzle with chocolate for a crunchy
snack. What you have to overcome in "ick factor," you gain in nutrition and taste. Indeed,
bugs can be delicious. Mealworms taste like roasted nuts. Locusts are similar to shrimp.
Crickets, some people say, have an aroma of popcorn. Farming insects for food also has
less environmental impact than livestock farms do because insects emit far less greenhouse
gas and use up less space, water, and food. Socioeconomically, bug production could uplift
people in developing countries since insect farms can be small scale, highly productive,
and yet relatively inexpensive to keep. Insects can also be turned into more sustainable
food for livestock and can be reared on organic waste, like vegetable peelings, that might
otherwise just end up rotting in landfills. Feeling hungry yet? Faced with a plate of
fried crickets, most people today would still recoil, imagining all those legs and feelers
getting stuck between their teeth.

But think of a lobster. It's pretty much just a giant insect with legs and feelers galore
that was once regarded as an inferior, repulsive food. Now, lobster is a delicacy. Can the
same paradigm shift happen for bugs? So, give it a try! Pop that insect into your mouth,
and savor the crunch.
