After centuries of war, the world’s kingdoms have come to an agreement. Every five years,
teams representing the elves, goblins, and treefolk will compete in a grand tournament 
of dragon jousting. Every team will face each of the others once. The kingdom whose team
wins the most matches will rule all of Center-Realm until the next tournament. To prevent
any outside meddling, the games are to be conducted in absolute secret except for a group
of wizards who will make sure nobody uses enchantments, hexes, or spells to cheat. You’ve
been given the extremely important job of recording the scores for the first inaugural
tournament. But the opening celebrations get a bit out of control, and when you wake up,
you realize the games are already underway. Fortunately, no one has noticed your absence
so far. However, you need to get up to speed quickly; if your boss, the head tournament
official, finds out you’ve been sleeping on the job, you’ll lose your head. After weighing
your options, you decide to offer your life’s savings to one of the regulation wizards in
return for the information, giving him your blank scorecard to fill out.

But before he can finish, your boss walks into the tent. You barely manage to hide the
scorecard in time, and the wizard excuses himself. Your boss chuckles. “Hope you didn’t
believe anything Gorbak’s been saying— he’s been cursed to tell only lies, even in
writing. Anyway, can you believe how low-scoring the tournament’s been? Every team has
played at least once, yet not a single match with a combined score of more than five
hits! Anyhow, I’ll be back in a minute to review your scorecard.” You laugh along, and
when he leaves you look at the partially completed card, now knowing every single number 
on it is wrong. You’ve only got one chance to save yourself, so what’s the real score of
each match? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. The incredible thing about this riddle 
is that you can reach the solution despite an almost complete lack of correct
information. And that’s possible because knowing that something is false is meaningful
information in its own right. The first key is to realize that no team will play more
than two matches, since there are only two other teams.

So if the elves didn’t actually play one match, and the goblins didn’t actually play two,
the truth must be that elves played two and goblins played one. For the elves to have
played two matches, they must’ve faced each of the other teams once. And since goblins
have only played one match so far— against the elves— that means the match between
goblins and treefolk has not occurred yet. We know it’s false that the treefolk tied zero
matches, which means their bout against the elves must’ve tied. We also know that the
elves won at least one match, and since they tied against the treefolk, they must have
beaten the goblins. But can we figure out the actual scores? Let’s start with the
elf-treefolk tie. Because no more than five total hits were scored, the final tally
must’ve been 0-0, 1-1, or 2-2. But the treefolk must’ve scored some hits, and it’s false
that they only had one hit scored against them.

The only option that leaves is 2-2.In the match between elves and goblins, the goblins
must’ve scored at least one hit. And the elf score must be 2 or more for them to have
won the match. This leaves only a few possibilities that add up to 5 or less. The elves
couldn’t have scored three, so that eliminates these two. And their total hits scored 
across both matches can’t add up to six, so this one’s out too. So the score must’ve been
2-1.With one match remaining, you’ve managed to save your job— and your neck. Gorbak the
wizard may have lied, but your deductive skills quickly evened the score.
