title: The jobs we'll lose to machines -- and the ones we won't
speaker: Anthony Goldbloom
description: >-
 Machine learning isn't just for simple tasks like assessing credit risk and
 sorting mail anymore -- today, it's capable of far more complex applications,
 like grading essays and diagnosing diseases. With these advances comes an uneasy
 question: Will a robot do your job in the future?

So this is my niece. Her name is Yahli. She is nine months old. Her mum is a doctor, and
her dad is a lawyer. By the time Yahli goes to college, the jobs her parents do are going
to look dramatically different. In 2013, researchers at Oxford University did a study on
the future of work. They concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of
being automated by machines. Machine learning is the technology that's responsible for
most of this disruption. It's the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence. It
allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can do. My
company, Kaggle, operates on the cutting edge of machine learning. We bring together
hundreds of thousands of experts to solve important problems for industry and academia.
This gives us a unique perspective on what machines can do, what they can't do and what
jobs they might automate or threaten. Machine learning started making its way into industry
in the early '90s.

It started with relatively simple tasks. It started with things like assessing credit risk
from loan applications, sorting the mail by reading handwritten characters from zip codes.
Over the past few years, we have made dramatic breakthroughs. Machine learning is now
capable of far, far more complex tasks. In 2012, Kaggle challenged its community to build
an algorithm that could grade high-school essays. The winning algorithms were able to
match the grades given by human teachers. Last year, we issued an even more difficult
challenge. Can you take images of the eye and diagnose an eye disease called diabetic
retinopathy? Again, the winning algorithms were able to match the diagnoses given by human
ophthalmologists. Now, given the right data, machines are going to outperform humans at
tasks like this. A teacher might read 10,000 essays over a 40-year career. An
ophthalmologist might see 50,000 eyes. A machine can read millions of essays or see
millions of eyes within minutes.

We have no chance of competing against machines on frequent, high-volume tasks. But there
are things we can do that machines can't do. Where machines have made very little progress
is in tackling novel situations. They can't handle things they haven't seen many times
before. The fundamental limitations of machine learning is that it needs to learn from
large volumes of past data. Now, humans don't. We have the ability to connect seemingly
disparate threads to solve problems we've never seen before. Percy Spencer was a physicist
working on radar during World War II, when he noticed the magnetron was melting his
chocolate bar. He was able to connect his understanding of electromagnetic radiation with
his knowledge of cooking in order to invent — any guesses? — the microwave oven. Now, this
is a particularly remarkable example of creativity. But this sort of cross-pollination
happens for each of us in small ways thousands of times per day.

Machines cannot compete with us when it comes to tackling novel situations, and this puts
a fundamental limit on the human tasks that machines will automate. So what does this mean
for the future of work? The future state of any single job lies in the answer to a single
question: To what extent is that job reducible to frequent, high-volume tasks, and to what
extent does it involve tackling novel situations? On frequent, high-volume tasks, machines
are getting smarter and smarter. Today they grade essays. They diagnose certain diseases.
Over coming years, they're going to conduct our audits, and they're going to read
boilerplate from legal contracts. Accountants and lawyers are still needed. They're going
to be needed for complex tax structuring, for pathbreaking litigation. But machines will
shrink their ranks and make these jobs harder to come by. Now, as mentioned, machines are
not making progress on novel situations.

The copy behind a marketing campaign needs to grab consumers' attention. It has to stand
out from the crowd. Business strategy means finding gaps in the market, things that nobody
else is doing. It will be humans that are creating the copy behind our marketing
campaigns, and it will be humans that are developing our business strategy. So Yahli,
whatever you decide to do, let every day bring you a new challenge. If it does, then you
will stay ahead of the machines. Thank you.
