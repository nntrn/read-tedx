title: How turtle shells evolved... twice
speaker: Judy Cebra-Thomas
description: >-
 Modern turtle shells are almost as diverse as the turtles themselves. Sea turtles
 have flatter, lighter shells for gliding through the water. Land-dwelling
 tortoises have domed shells that can slip free of predators' jaws. Leatherback
 turtles have shells without the ring of bone around the edge. So how did the
 shell evolve? Judy Cebra-Thomas explores the ancestry of the turtle. [Directed by

Meet Odontochelys semitestacea. This little creature spends its days splashing in Late
Triassic swamps with a host of other reptiles. Under the surface lies its best defense
against attack: a hard shell on its belly. Odontochelys is an early ancestor of the
turtle. Its half-shelled body illustrates an important point about the modern turtle: it
actually has two shells that develop totally separately while the turtle is still an
embryo. Both are extensions of the animal’s skeleton, and together they are made of
almost 60 bones. Like other embryos, turtle embryos are made of undifferentiated cells
that become specific cell types, and then organs and tissues, through gene activity and
communication between cells. At first, turtle embryos look very similar to those of other
reptiles, birds, and mammals, except for a bulge of cells called the carapacial ridge.
The ridge expands around the body between the neck and lower back, creating a disc
shape.

It guides the formation of the upper part of the turtle’s shell, called the carapace,
likely by attracting the cells that will become ribs. Instead of curving downwards to
make a regular rib cage, the ribs move outwards towards the carapacial ridge. They then
secrete a signaling protein that converts surrounding cells into bone-forming cells.
These fifty bones grow until they meet and connect with sutures. A ring of bone
solidifies the carapace’s edges. The outer layer of skin cells produces the scales,
known as scutes, that cover the carapace. The development of the bottom half of the shell,
the plastron, is driven by neural crest cells, which can produce a variety of different 
cell types including neurons, cartilage and bone. A thick shield of these cells spreads
across the belly, coming together in regions that produce nine plate-like bones.
Eventually, these connect to the carapace by sutures. A turtle’s shell has obvious
advantages for guarding against predators, but the rigid casing also presents some
challenges.

As the turtle grows, the sutures between the bones of the carapace and plastron spread.
Most mammals and reptiles rely on a flexible rib cage that expands to allow them to
breathe, but turtles use abdominal muscles attached to the shell instead: one to breathe
in, and one to breathe out. So how did the shell evolve? Though there are still gaps in
the fossil record, the first step seems to have been a thickening of the ribs. The
oldest known turtle ancestor, a creature called Eunotosaurus africanus, lived 260 million
years ago and looked almost nothing like a modern turtle, but it had a set of broad, flat
ribs that anchored the muscles of its powerful forearms. Eunotosaurus was likely a
burrowing creature, digging homes for itself in what’s now southern Africa. Odontochelys
semitestacea illustrates another, later step in turtle evolution, with thick ribs like
Eunotosaurus plus a belly plate for protection.

Our first fossil evidence of the full shell characteristic of modern turtles is about 210
million years old, and belongs to a species called Proganochelys quenstedti, whose ribs
had fused. Proganochelys could move between water and land. Unlike modern turtles, it
couldn’t retract its head into its shell, but had defensive spines on its neck. Modern
turtle shells are almost as diverse as the turtles themselves. Sea turtles have flatter,
lighter shells for streamlined gliding through the water. Land-dwelling tortoises,
meanwhile, have domed shells that can slip free of predators’ jaws and help them turn
right-side up if they fall on their backs. Leatherback and softshell turtles have shells
without the ring of bone around the edge of the carapace or the tough scutes covering it,
making it easier for them to squeeze into tight spaces.
