Why are transgender people suddenly everywhere?

As a trans activist, I get this question a lot. Keep in mind, less than one percent of
American adults openly identify as trans. According to a recent GLAAD survey, about 16
percent of non-trans Americans claim to know a trans person in real life. So for the other
84 percent, this may seem like a new topic. But trans people are not new. Gender variance
is older than you think, and trans people are part of that legacy. From central Africa to
South America to the Pacific Islands and beyond, there have been populations who recognize
multiple genders, and they go way back. The hijra of India and Pakistan, for example, have
been cited as far back as 2,000 years ago in the Kama Sutra. Indigenous American nations
each have their own terms, but most share the umbrella term "two-spirit." They saw
gender-variant people as shamans and healers in their communities, and it wasn't until the
spread of colonialism that they were taught to think otherwise. Now, in researching trans
history, we look for both trans people and trans practices.

Take, for example, the women who presented as men so they could fight in the US Civil War.
After the war, most resumed their lives as women, but some, like Albert Cashier, continued
to live as men. Albert was eventually confined to an asylum and forced to wear a dress for
the rest of his life.

Around 1895, a group of self-described androgynes formed the Cercle Hermaphroditos. Their
mission was to unite for defense against the world's bitter persecution. And in doing
that, they became one of the earliest trans support groups. By the '40s and '50s, medical
researchers were starting to study trans medicine, but they were aided by their trans
patients, like Louise Lawrence, a trans woman who had corresponded extensively with people
who had been arrested for public cross-dressing. She introduced sexual researchers like
Alfred Kinsey to a massive trans network. Other early figures would follow, like Virginia
Prince, Reed Erickson and the famous Christine Jorgensen, who made headlines with her very
public transition in 1952.But while white trans suburbanites were forming their own
support networks, many trans people of color had to carve their own path. Some, like Miss
Major Griffin-Gracy, walked in drag balls.

Others were the so-called "street queens," who were often targeted by police for their
gender expression and found themselves on the forefront of seminal events in the LGBT
rights movement. This brings us to the riots at Cooper Do-nuts in 1959, Compton's Cafeteria
in 1966 and the famous Stonewall Inn in 1969. In 1970, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P.
Johnson, two veterans of Stonewall, established STAR: Street Transvestite Action
Revolutionaries. Trans people continued to fight for equal treatment under the law, even
as they faced higher rates of discrimination, unemployment, arrests, and the looming AIDS
epidemic. For as long as we've been around, those in power have sought to disenfranchise
trans people for daring to live lives that are ours. This motion picture still, taken in
Berlin in 1933, is sometimes used in history textbooks to illustrate how the Nazis burned
works they considered un-German.

But what's rarely mentioned is that included in this massive pile are works from the
Institute for Sexual Research. See, I just recapped the trans movement in America, but
Magnus Hirschfeld and his peers in Germany had us beat by a few decades. Magnus Hirschfeld
was an early advocate for LGBT people. He wrote the first book-length account of trans
individuals. He helped them obtain medical services and IDs. He worked with the Berlin
Police Department to end discrimination of LGBT people, and he hired them at the
Institute. So when the Nazi Party burned his library, it had devastating implications for
trans research around the world. This was a deliberate attempt to erase trans people, and
it was neither the first nor the last. So whenever people ask me why trans people are
suddenly everywhere, I just want to tell them that we've been here. These stories have to
be told, along with the countless others that have been buried by time.

Not only were our lives not celebrated, but our struggles have been forgotten and, yeah,
to some people, that makes trans issues seem new. Today, I meet a lot of people who think
that our movement is just a phase that will pass, but I also hear well-intentioned allies
telling us all to be patient, because our movement is "still new." Imagine how the
conversation would shift if we acknowledge just how long trans people have been demanding
equality. Are we still overreacting? Should we continue to wait? Or should we, for example,
do something about the trans women of color who are murdered and whose killers never see
justice? Do our circumstances seem dire to you yet? 

Finally, I want other trans people to realize they're not alone. I grew up thinking my
identity was an anomaly that would die with me. People drilled this idea of otherness into
my mind, and I bought it because I didn't know anyone else like me. Maybe if I had known
my ancestors sooner, it wouldn't have taken me so long to find a source of pride in my
identity and in my community. Because I belong to an amazing, vibrant community of people
that uplift each other even when others won't, that take care of each other even when we
are struggling, that somehow, despite it all, still find cause to celebrate each other, to
love each other, to look one another in the eyes and say, "You are not alone. You have us.
And we're not going anywhere."Thank you.
