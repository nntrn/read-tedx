4,300 years ago in ancient Sumer, the most powerful person in the city of Ur was banished
to wander the vast desert. Her name was Enheduanna. She was the high priestess of the moon
god and history’s first known author. By the time of her exile, she had written 42 hymns
and three epic poems— and Sumer hadn’t heard the last of her. Enheduanna lived 1,700 years 
before Sappho, 1,500 years before Homer, and about 500 years before the biblical
patriarch Abraham. She was born in Mesopotamia, the land between the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers, and the birthplace of the first cities and high cultures. Her father was King
Sargon the Great, history’s first empire builder, who conquered the independent
city-states of Mesopotamia under a unified banner. Sargon was a northern Semite who
spoke Akkadian, and the older Sumerian cities in the south viewed him as a foreign
invader. They frequently revolted to regain their independence, fracturing his new
dynasty. To bridge the gap between cultures, Sargon appointed his only daughter, 
Enheduanna, as high priestess in the empire’s most important temple.

Female royalty traditionally served religious roles, and she was educated to read and
write in both Sumerian and Akkadian, and make mathematical calculations. The world's first
writing started in Sumer as a system of accounting, allowing merchants to communicate 
over long distances with traders abroad. Their pictogram system of record keeping 
developed into a script about 300 years before Enheduanna’s birth. This early writing
style, called cuneiform, was written with a reed stylus pressed into soft clay to make
wedge-shaped marks. But until Enheduanna, this writing mostly took the form of record
keeping and transcription, rather than original works attributable to individual
writers. Enheduanna’s Ur was a city of 34,000 people with narrow streets, multi-storied
brick homes, granaries, and irrigation. As high priestess, Enheduanna managed grain
storage for the city, oversaw hundreds of temple workers, interpreted sacred dreams, and
presided over the monthly new moon festival and rituals celebrating the
equinoxes. Enheduanna set about unifying the older Sumerian culture with the newer
Akkadian civilization.

To accomplish this, she wrote 42 religious hymns that combined both mythologies. Each
Mesopotamian city was ruled by a patron deity, so her hymns were dedicated to the ruling
god of each major city. She praised the city’s temple, glorified the god’s attributes,
and explained the god’s relationship to other deities within the pantheon. In her
writing, she humanized the once aloof gods— now they suffered, fought, loved, and
responded to human pleading. Enheduanna’s most valuable literary contribution was the
poetry she wrote to Inanna, goddess of war and desire, the divinely chaotic energy that
gives spark to the universe. Inanna delighted in all forms of sexual expression and was
considered so powerful that she transcended gender boundaries, as did her earthly
attendants, who could be prostitutes, eunuchs or cross-dressers. Enheduanna placed Inanna
at the top of the pantheon as the most powerful deity.

Her odes to Inanna mark the first time an author writes using the pronoun “I,” and the
first time writing is used to explore deep, private emotions. After the death of
Enheduanna’s father, King Sargon, a general took advantage of the power vacuum and
staged a coup. As a powerful member of the ruling family, Enheduanna was a target, and the
general exiled her from Ur. Her nephew, the legendary Sumerian king Naram-Sin, ultimately
crushed the uprising and restored his aunt as high priestess. In total, Enheduanna served 
as high priestess for 40 years. After her death, she became a minor deity, and her poetry
was copied, studied, and performed throughout the empire for over 500 years. Her poems
influenced the Hebrew Old Testament, the epics of Homer, and Christian hymns. Today,
Enheduanna’s legacy still exists, on clay tablets that have stood the test of
time.
