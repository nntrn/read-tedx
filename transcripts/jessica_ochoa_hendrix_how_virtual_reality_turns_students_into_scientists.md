title: How virtual reality turns students into scientists
speaker: Jessica Ochoa Hendrix
description: >-
 Using low-cost virtual reality, education activist Jessica Ochoa Hendrix helps
 bring science to life in schools across the US. In this quick talk, she explains
 how a VR experience she developed invites students to explore underwater
 ecosystems as if they're marine biologists -- and envision themselves in other
 careers they might not have otherwise imagined.

How did you discover your passion or find your career? Were you exposed to it? Or was it
trial and error? As child rights advocate Marian Wright Edelman said, "You can't be what
you can't see." Fortunately, we now live in a time when emerging technologies may help us
to solve this problem. For the past two years, I've been developing an extended reality
program that enables middle school students from across the country to take on the role of
a marine biologist — even if they've never seen the ocean. As one seventh grader who
recently completed our program said, "I could see myself as a scientist, because I enjoyed
this game."This feedback really excited me, because too few students do see themselves as
scientists. A 2014 study showed that 57 percent of eighth- and ninth-grade students said,
"Science isn't me." Coincidentally, also in 2014, I met Mandë Holford, a marine
biochemist, and Lindsay Portnoy, an educational psychologist.

The three of us shared a passion for getting students excited by and comfortable with
science. We thought about how we could give children the most realistic experience of a
scientific career. We discussed the research; it showed that students felt comfortable
taking risks when playing games. So the three of us started an educational games company to
bring science to life. Virtual reality seemed like a low-cost way of increasing access. In
addition, academic research has shown that virtual reality may lead to increases in
learning retention. This was perfect for us, as we wanted to be in schools so that we
could reach the most number of students possible, particularly students who have been
underrepresented in science. So, with funding from the National Science Foundation, we
began developing our extended reality program that combined virtual reality with
personalized digital journaling. We worked with teachers while developing it to ensure
that it would fit seamlessly into existing curricula and empower teachers to use
cutting-edge technology in their classroom.

We designed the virtual reality for Google Cardboard, which requires only a smartphone and
a 10 dollar VR viewer made of cardboard. With this inexpensive headset, students are
transported to an underwater expedition. Students use their digital journal to write down
their notes, to answer questions, to construct models and to develop hypotheses. Students
then go to the virtual world to test their hypotheses and see if they're accurate, much as
scientists go to the field in their careers. When students return to their digital
journal, they share their observations, claims, reasoning and evidence. The students'
written answers and virtual interactions are all updated live in an educator assessment
dashboard, so that teachers can follow their progress and support them as needed. To give
you a better sense, I'm going to show you a little bit of what students see. This is the
virtual reality when they're underwater observing the flora and fauna.

This is the digital journal where they're constructing their models based on this abiotic
data to show what they expect to see. Here, they're supporting that with qualitative
statements. And this is the educator dashboard that shows progress and enables [teachers]
to see the students' answers as they go. When we were creating BioDive, again, we really
wanted to focus on access, so we designed it to require only one phone for every four
students. We also knew how collaborative science work is, so we constructed the experience
to only be solved through collaborative teamwork, as each student is an expert in a
different geographic location. Given that these children's brains are still developing, we
limited each experience to last a maximum of two minutes. And finally, because we know the
importance of repeated exposure for internalizing knowledge, we constructed BioDive to
take place over five class periods. We started piloting BioDive in 2017 in 20 schools in
New York and New Jersey.

We wanted to see students as they were using this new technology. In 2019, now, we are now
piloting in 26 states. What we have heard from teachers who have taught our program: "It
was a nice way to show ocean dynamics without the luxury of actually being there since we
are in Ohio."

"It's pretty mind-blowing." "The students were totally engaged." But what really gives us
hope is what we're hearing from students. "I liked how it felt like I was there." "It's
interactive and a fun way to learn." "It really gave me realistic examples of how these
organisms appear." "I could see myself as a scientist because it seems really fun."Our
feedback wasn't always so positive. When we began developing, we started off by asking
students what they liked, what they didn't like and what they found confusing. Eventually
we began asking what they wished they could do. Their feedback gave us concrete items to
build in to be sure that we were including student voices in what we were designing.
Overall, what we have learned is that this is the beginning of a new platform for giving
students both voice and ownership in deciding how they want to have impact in their
careers. We focused on science, because we know we need scientists to help us solve our
current and future challenges.

But virtual reality could support students in any area. How could we support students in
exploring all of their desires with these eye-opening experiences and chances to learn
from primary sources? Could we create VR for inexpensive headsets that lets them be
immersed in oral literature or in critical moments of human history? Extended reality has
the potential to change the trajectory of our children's lives and lead them to careers
they never imagined by giving them the chance to see what they can be. Thank
you.
