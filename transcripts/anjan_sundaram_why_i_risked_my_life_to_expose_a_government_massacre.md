title: Why I risked my life to expose a government massacre
speaker: Anjan Sundaram
description: >-
 A war zone can pass for a mostly peaceful place when no one is watching, says
 investigative journalist and TED Fellow Anjan Sundaram. In this short, incisive
 talk, he takes us inside the conflict in the Central African Republic, where he
 saw the methodical preparation for ethnic cleansing, and shares a lesson about
 why it's important to bear witness to other people's suffering. "Ignored people
 in all our communities tell us something important about who we are," Sundaram
 says. "A witness can become precious, and their gaze most necessary, when
 violence passes silently, unseen and unheard."

What does it mean to be a witness? Why is it important to bear witness to people's
suffering, especially when those people are isolated from us? And what happens when we
turn away? Three years ago, I traveled to the Central African Republic to report on its
ongoing war. I'd heard warnings of massacres in the country's jungles and deserts, but no
one could locate these massacres or tell me who was killed, or when. I drove into this war
with little information. I witnessed scenes that were tragic and unreal, and only at the
end did I realize that I had witnessed the slow preparation of ethnic cleansing. The
Central African Republic is a country of about five million people the size of Texas in
the center of Africa. The country has known chronic violence since French colonial rule
ended in 1960. The war I reported on was between the minority Muslim government, called
the Seleka, and citizen militias, mostly Christian, called the anti-balaka. The first sign
of the impending cleansing was the breakdown of trust within communities.

Three days after I arrived in the country, I watched the small city of Gaga be abandoned.
A battle was about to break out. And to save themselves, many people were working as
government spies, identifying friends and neighbors to be killed. Cities and towns, any
place with humans, had become unsafe. So people moved to the jungle. I felt strangely
isolated as pigs and livestock moved into the empty homes. In a war zone, you know that
you are near the killing when people have left. The war moved across the jungle and reached
Gaga, and I was surrounded by the thunder of bombs. Government forces drove into the
jungle to attack a town sheltering a militia. I rode on motorcycle for hours, crossing
jungle streams and tall elephant grass, but I only got to the town after the government
had burned it and its people were gone. To see if I could speak to someone, I shouted out
that I was a friend, that I would not hurt them. A woman in a red shirt ran out of the
forest.

Others cautiously emerged from the trees and asked, "Est-ce les gens savent?" "Do people
know?"The question surprised me. Their children were hungry and sick, but they didn't ask
for food or medicine. They asked me, "Do people know what is happening to us?" I felt
helpless as I wrote down their question. And I became determined that this moment in their
lives should not be forgotten. In bearing witness to their crisis, I felt a small
communion with these people. From far away, this war had felt like a footnote in world
news. As a witness, the war felt like history unfolding. The government denied that it was
committing any violence, but I continually drove through towns where people described
government massacres from a day or a week before. I felt overwhelmed and tried to calm
myself. As I reported on these massacres, I bought and ate little sweets, seeking the
familiar comfort of their taste.

Central Africans ate these sweets to ease their hunger, leaving a trail of thousands of
plastic wrappers as they fled. On the few radio stations still operating in the country, I
mostly heard pop music. As the war mounted, we received less information about the
massacres. It became easier to feel a sense of normalcy. I witnessed the effect of this
missing information. Two weeks later, I slowly and anxiously drove into an isolated
militia headquarters, a town called PK100. Here, Christian fighters told me that all
Muslims were foreigners, evil and allied with the government. They likened Muslims to
animals. Without neutral observers or media to counter this absurd narrative, it became
the single narrative in these camps. The militias began to hunt down Muslims, and emptied
the capital, Bangui, of nearly 140,000 Muslims in just a few months. Most of the killing
and fleeing of Muslims went unrecorded by witnesses. I'm telling you about my reporting in
the Central African Republic, but I still ask myself why I went there.

Why put myself at risk? I do this work because I feel that ignored people in all our
communities tell us something important about who we are. When information is missing,
people have the power to manipulate reality. Without witnesses, we would believe that
those thousands of massacred people are still alive, that those hundreds of burned homes
are still standing. A war zone can pass for a mostly peaceful place when no one is
watching. And a witness can become precious, and their gaze most necessary, when violence
passes silently, unseen and unheard. Thank you.
