title: An engineer's vision for tiny forests, everywhere
speaker: Shubhendu Sharma
description: >-
 A forest planted by humans, then left to nature's own devices, typically takes at
 least 100 years to mature. But what if we could make the process happen ten times
 faster? In this short talk, eco-entrepreneur (and TED Fellow) Shubhendu Sharma
 explains how to create a mini-forest ecosystem anywhere.

I'm an industrial engineer. The goal in my life has always been to make more and more
products in the least amount of time and resources. While working at Toyota, all I knew
was how to make cars until I met Dr. Akira Miyawaki, who came to our factory to make a
forest in it in order to make it carbon-neutral. I was so fascinated that I decided to
learn this methodology by joining his team as a volunteer. Soon, I started making a forest
in the backyard of my own house, and this is how it looks after three years. These forests,
compared to a conventional plantation, grow 10 times faster, they're 30 times more dense,
and 100 times more biodiverse. Within two years of having this forest in our backyard, I
could observe that the groundwater didn't dry during summers, the number of bird species I
spotted in this area doubled. Quality of air became better, and we started harvesting
seasonal fruits growing effortlessly right in the backyard of our house. I wanted to make
more of these forests.

I was so moved by these results that I wanted to make these forests with the same acumen
with which we make cars or write software or do any mainstream business, so I founded a
company which is an end-to-end service provider to create these native natural forests.
But to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry, we had to standardize
the process of forest-making. So we benchmarked the Toyota Production System known for its
quality and efficiency for the process of forest-making. For an example, the core of TPS,
Toyota Production System, lies in heijunka, which is making manufacturing of different
models of cars on a single assembly line. We replaced these cars with trees, using which
now we can make multi-layered forests. These forests utilize 100 percent vertical space.
They are so dense that one can't even walk into them. For an example, we can make a
300-tree forest in an area as small as the parking spaces of six cars.

In order to reduce cost and our own carbon footprint, we started utilizing local biomass
as soil amender and fertilizers. For example, coconut shells crushed in a machine mixed
with rice straw, powder of rice husk mixed with organic manure is finally dumped in soil
on which our forest is planted. Once planted, we use grass or rice straw to cover the soil
so that all the water which goes into irrigation doesn't get evaporated back into the
atmosphere. And using these simple improvisations, today we can make a forest for a cost
as low as the cost of an iPhone. Today, we are making forests in houses, in schools, even
in factories with the corporates. But that's not enough. There is a huge number of people
who want to take matters into their own hands. So we let it happen. Today, we are working
on an Internet-based platform where we are going to share our methodology on an open
source using which anyone and everyone can make their own forest without our physical
presence being there, using our methodology.

At the click of a button, they can get to know all the native species of their place. By
installing a small hardware probe on site, we can do remote soil testing, using which we
can give step-by-step instructions on forest-making remotely. Also we can monitor the
growth of this forest without being on site. This methodology, I believe, has a potential.
By sharing, we can actually bring back our native forests. Now, when you go back home, if
you see a barren piece of land, do remember that it can be a potential forest. Thank you
very much. Thanks.
