title: What makes the Great Wall of China so extraordinary
speaker: Megan Campisi and Pen-Pen Chen
description: >-
 The Great Wall of China is a 13,000-mile dragon of earth and stone that winds its
 way through the countryside of China. As it turns out, the wall's history is
 almost as long and serpentine as its structure. Megan Campisi and Pen-Pen Chen
 detail the building and subsequent decay of this massive, impressive wall.

A 13,000 mile dragon of earth and stone winds its way through the countryside of China
with a history almost as long and serpentine as the structure. The Great Wall began as
multiple walls of rammed earth built by individual feudal states during the Chunqiu period
to protect against nomadic raiders north of China and each other. When Emperor Qin Shi
Huang unified the states in 221 BCE, the Tibetan Plateau and Pacific Ocean became natural
barriers, but the mountains in the north remained vulnerable to Mongol, Turkish, and
Xiongnu invasions. To defend against them, the Emperor expanded the small walls built by
his predecessors, connecting some and fortifying others. As the structures grew from
Lintao in the west to Liaodong in the east, they collectively became known as The Long
Wall. To accomplish this task, the Emperor enlisted soldiers and commoners, not always
voluntarily. Of the hundreds of thousands of builders recorded during the Qin Dynasty,
many were forcibly conscripted peasants and others were criminals serving out
sentences.

Under the Han Dynasty, the wall grew longer still, reaching 3700 miles, and spanning from
Dunhuang to the Bohai Sea. Forced labor continued under the Han Emperor Han-Wudi , and the
walls reputation grew into a notorious place of suffering. Poems and legends of the time
told of laborers buried in nearby mass graves, or even within the wall itself. And while
no human remains have been found inside, grave pits do indicate that many workers died
from accidents, hunger and exhaustion. The wall was formidable but not invincible. Both
Genghis and his son Khublai Khan managed to surmount the wall during the Mongol invasion
of the 13th Century. After the Ming dynasty gained control in 1368, they began to
refortify and further consolidate the wall using bricks and stones from local kilns.
Averaging 23 feet high and 21 feet wide, the walls 5500 miles were punctuated by
watchtowers. When raiders were sighted, fire and smoke signals traveled between towers
until reinforcements arrived.

Small openings along the wall let archers fire on invaders, while larger ones were used to
drop stones and more. But even this new and improved wall was not enough. In 1644,
northern Manchu clans overthrew the Ming to establish the Qing dynasty, incorporating
Mongolia as well, Thus, for the second time, China was ruled by the very people the wall
had tried to keep out. With the empire's borders now extending beyond the Great Wall, the
fortifications lost their purpose. And without regular reinforcement, the wall fell into
disrepair, rammed earth eroded, while brick and stone were plundered for building
materials. But its job wasn't finished. During World War II, China used sections for
defense against Japanese invasion, and some parts are still rumored to be used for
military training. But the Wall's main purpose today is cultural. As one of the largest
man-made structures on Earth, it was granted UNESCO World Heritage Status in
1987.

Originally built to keep people out of China, the Great Wall now welcomes millions of
visitors each year. In fact, the influx of tourists has caused the wall to deteriorate,
leading the Chinese government to launch preservation initiatives. It's also often
acclaimed as the only man-made structure visible from space. Unfortunately, that's not at
all true. In low Earth orbit, all sorts of structures, like bridges, highways and airports
are visible, and the Great Wall is only barely discernible. From the moon, it doesn't
stand a chance. But regardless, it's the Earth we should be studying it from because new
sections are still discovered every few years, branching off from the main body and
expanding this remarkable monument to human achievement.
