title: Empathy is not endorsement
speaker: Dylan Marron

 Digital creator Dylan Marron has racked up millions of views for projects like
 "Every Single Word" and "Sitting in Bathrooms With Trans People" -- but he's
 found that the flip side of success online is internet hate. Over time, he's
 developed an unexpected coping mechanism: calling the people who leave him
 insensitive comments and asking a simple question: "Why did you write that?" In a
 thoughtful talk about how we interact online, Marron explains how sometimes the
 most subversive thing you can do is actually speak with people you disagree with,
 not simply at them.

Hi. I've received hate online. A lot of it. And it comes with the territory of my work.
I'm a digital creator, I make things specifically for the internet. Like, a few years ago,
I made a video series called "Every Single Word" where I edited down popular films to only
the words spoken by people of color, as a way to empirically and accessibly talk about the
issue of representation in Hollywood. Then, later, as transphobic bathroom bill started
gaining media attention around the United States, I hosted and produced an interview
series called "Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People" where I did exactly
that.

And then — Sure, I'll take applause.

Thank you. And then, are you familiar with those unboxing videos on YouTube where
YouTubers open up the latest electronic gadgets? Great, so I satirized those in a weekly
series, where instead I unboxed intangible ideologies like police brutality, masculinity
and the mistreatment of Native Americans.

My work — Thanks. One person applauding, God bless.

Mom, hi.

So, my work became popular. Very popular. I got millions of views, a ton of great press
and a slew of new followers. But the flip side of success on the internet is internet
hate. I was called everything. From "beta" to "snowflake" and, of course, the ever-popular
"cuck." Don't worry, I will break these terms down for you.

So, "beta," for those of you unfamiliar, is shorthand online lingo for "beta male." But
let's be real, I wear pearl earrings and my fashion aesthetic is rich-white-woman-running-errands,
so I'm not angling to be an alpha.

Doesn't totally work.

Now, "snowflake" is a put-down for people who are sensitive and believe themselves to be
unique, and I'm a millennial and an only child, so, duh!

But my favorite, favorite, favorite is "cuck." It's a slur, short for "cuckold," for men
who have been cheated on by their wives. But friends, I am so gay, that if I had a wife, I
would encourage her to cheat on me.

Thank you. Let's take a look at some of this negativity in action. Sometimes it's direct.
Like Marcos, who wrote, "You're everything I hate in a human being." Thank you, Marcos.
Others are more concise. Like Donovan, who wrote, "gaywad fagggggg." Now, I do need to
point out, Donovan is not wrong, OK? In fact, he's right on both counts, so credit where
credit is due. Thank you, Donovan. Others write to me with questions, like Brian, who
asked, "Were you born a bitch or did you just learn to be one over time?" But my favorite
thing about this is that once Brian was done typing, his finger must have slipped because
then he sent me the thumbs-up emoji.

So, babe, thumbs up to you, too.

It's fun to talk about these messages now. Right? And it's cathartic to laugh at them. But
I can tell you that it really does not feel good to receive them. At first, I would
screenshot their comments and make fun of their typos, but this soon felt elitist and
ultimately unhelpful. So over time, I developed an unexpected coping mechanism. Because
most of these messages I received were through social media, I could often click on the
profile picture of the person who sent them and learn everything about them. I could see
pictures they were tagged in, posts they'd written, memes they'd shared, and somehow,
seeing that it was a human on the other side of the screen made me feel a little better.
Not to justify what they wrote, right? But just to provide context. Still, that didn't
feel like enough. So, I called some of them — only the ones I felt safe talking to — with
a simple opening question: "Why did you write that?"The first person I spoke to was
Josh.

He had written to tell me that I was a moron, I was a reason this country was dividing
itself, and he added at the end that being gay was a sin. I was so nervous for our first
conversation. This wasn't a comments section. So I couldn't use tools like muting or
blocking. Of course, I guess, I could have hung up on him. But I didn't want to. Because I
liked talking to him. Because I liked him. Here's a clip of one of our
conversations.

Dylan Marron: Josh, you said you're about to graduate high school, right? Josh: Mmm-hmm. DM:
How is high school for you? Josh: Am I allowed to use the H-E-double-hockey-stick word? DM:
Oh, yeah. You're allowed to. Josh: It was hell. DM: Really? Josh: And it's still hell right
now, even though it's only two weeks left. I'm a little bit bigger — I don't like to use
the word "fat," but I am a little bit bigger than a lot of my classmates and they seem to
judge me before they even got to know me. DM: That's awful. I mean, I also just want to let
you know, Josh, I was bullied in high school, too. So did our common ground of being
bullied in high school erase what he wrote me? No. And did our single phone conversation
radically heal a politically divided country and cure systemic injustice? No, absolutely
not, right? But did our conversation humanize us to each other more than profile pictures
and posts ever could? Absolutely. I didn't stop there.

Because some of the hate I received was from "my side." So when Matthew, a queer liberal
artist like me publicly wrote that I represented some of the worst aspects of liberalism,
I wanted to ask him this. DM: You tagged me in this post. Did you want me to see it? Matthew

: I honestly didn't think that you would. DM: Have you ever been publicly dragged? Matthew:
I have been. And I just said, "No, I don't care."DM: And did you not care? Matthew: But it
was hard. DM: Did you not care? Matthew: Oh, I cared, yes. DM: At the end of these
conversations, there's often a moment of reflection. A reconsideration. And that's exactly
what happened at the end of my call with a guy named Doug who had written that I was a
talentless propaganda hack.

Did the conversation we just had — does it, like, make you feel differently about how you
write online? Doug: Yeah! You know, when I said this to you, when I said you were a
"talentless hack," I had never conversed with you in my life, really. I didn't really know
anything really about you. And I think that a lot of times, that's what the comment
sections really are, it's really a way to get your anger at the world out on random
profiles of strangers, pretty much. DM 

: Yeah, right. Doug: But it definitely has made me rethink the way that I interact with
people online. DM: So I've collected these conversations and many others for my podcast
"Conversations with People Who Hate Me."

Before I started this project, I thought that the real way to bring about change was to
shut down opposing viewpoints through epically worded video essays and comments and posts,
but I soon learned those were only cheered on by the people who already agreed with me.
Sometimes — bless you. Sometimes, the most subversive thing you could do — yeah, clap for
him.

Sometimes, the most subversive thing you could do was to actually speak with the people
you disagreed with, and not simply at them. Now in every one of my calls, I always ask my
guests to tell me about themselves. And it's their answer to this question that allows me
to empathize with them. And empathy, it turns out, is a key ingredient in getting these
conversations off the ground, but it can feel very vulnerable to be empathizing with
someone you profoundly disagree with. So I established a helpful mantra for myself.
Empathy is not endorsement. Empathizing with someone you profoundly disagree with does not
suddenly compromise your own deeply held beliefs and endorse theirs. Empathizing with
someone who, for example, believes that being gay is a sin doesn't mean that I'm suddenly
going to drop everything, pack my bags and grab my one-way ticket to hell, right? It just
means that I'm acknowledging the humanity of someone who was raised to think very
differently from me.

I also want to be super clear about something. This is not a prescription for activism. I
understand that some people don't feel safe talking to their detractors and others feel so
marginalized that they justifiably don't feel that they have any empathy to give. I
totally get that. This is just what I feel well-suited to do. You know, I've reached out to
a lot of people for this podcast. And some have politely declined, others have read my
message and ignored it, some have blocked me automatically when I sent the invitation and
one guy actually agreed to do it and then, five minutes into the call, hung up on me. I'm
also aware that this talk will appear on the internet. And with the internet comes comment
sections, and with comment sections inevitably comes hate. So as you are watching this
talk, you can feel free to call me whatever you'd like. You can call me a "gaywad," a
"snowflake," a "cuck," a "beta," or "everything wrong with liberalism." But just know that
if you do, I may ask you to talk.

And if you refuse or block me automatically or agree and hang up on me, then maybe, babe,
the snowflake is you. Thank you so much.
