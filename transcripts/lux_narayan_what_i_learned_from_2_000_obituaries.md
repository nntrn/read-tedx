speaker: Lux Narayan
description: >-
 Lux Narayan starts his day with scrambled eggs and the question: "Who died
 today?" Why? By analyzing 2,000 New York Times obituaries over a 20-month period,
 Narayan gleaned, in just a few words, what achievement looks like over a

Joseph Keller used to jog around the Stanford campus, and he was struck by all the women
jogging there as well. Why did their ponytails swing from side to side like that? Being a
mathematician, he set out to understand why.

Professor Keller was curious about many things: why teapots dribble or how earthworms
wriggle. Until a few months ago, I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller. I read about him in the
New York Times, in the obituaries. The Times had half a page of editorial dedicated to
him, which you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature. I read the
obituaries almost every day. My wife understandably thinks I'm rather morbid to begin my
day with scrambled eggs and a "Let's see who died today."

But if you think about it, the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news, and cues
man's failures. An instance where bad news cues accomplishment is at the end of the paper,
in the obituaries. In my day job, I run a company that focuses on future insights that
marketers can derive from past data — a kind of rearview-mirror analysis. And we began to
think: What if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the New York Times? Were there
lessons on how you could get your obituary featured — even if you aren't around to enjoy
it?

Would this go better with scrambled eggs?

And so, we looked at the data. 2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries over a 20-month period
between 2015 and 2016. What did these 2,000 deaths — rather, lives — teach us? Well, first
we looked at words. This here is an obituary headline. This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan
Yew. If you remove the beginning and the end, you're left with a beautifully worded
descriptor that tries to, in just a few words, capture an achievement or a lifetime. Just
looking at these is fascinating. Here are a few famous ones, people who died in the last
two years. Try and guess who they are.[An Artist who Defied Genre] That's Prince.[Titan of
Boxing and the 20th Century] Oh, yes.[Muhammad Ali][Groundbreaking Architect] Zaha
Hadid. So we took these descriptors and did what's called natural language processing,
where you feed these into a program, it throws out the superfluous words — "the," "and," —
the kind of words you can mime easily in "Charades," — and leaves you with the most
significant words.

And we did it not just for these four, but for all 2,000 descriptors. And this is what it
looks like. Film, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge. Over 40 percent. You
have to wonder why in so many societies we insist that our kids pursue engineering or
medicine or business or law to be construed as successful. And while we're talking
profession, let's look at age — the average age at which they achieved things. That number
is 37. What that means is, you've got to wait 37 years ... before your first significant
achievement that you're remembered for — on average — 44 years later, when you die at the
age of 81 — on average.

Talk about having to be patient.

Of course, it varies by profession. If you're a sports star, you'll probably hit your
stride in your 20s. And if you're in your 40s like me, you can join the fun world of
politics.

Politicians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their
mid-40s.

If you're wondering what "others" are, here are some examples. Isn't it fascinating, the
things people do and the things they're remembered for?

Our curiosity was in overdrive, and we desired to analyze more than just a descriptor. So,
we ingested the entire first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries, but we did this separately
for two groups of people: people that are famous and people that are not famous. Famous
people — Prince, Ali, Zaha Hadid — people who are not famous are people like Jocelyn
Cooper, Reverend Curry or Lorna Kelly. I'm willing to bet you haven't heard of most of
their names. Amazing people, fantastic achievements, but they're not famous. So what if we
analyze these two groups separately — the famous and the non-famous? What might that tell
us? Take a look. Two things leap out at me. First: "John."

Anyone here named John should thank your parents —

and remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you're gone. And second: "help."We
uncovered, many lessons from lives well-led, and what those people immortalized in print
could teach us. The exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life,
and even more fascinating was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries
featured people famous and non-famous, who did seemingly extraordinary things. They made a
positive dent in the fabric of life. They helped. So ask yourselves as you go back to your
daily lives: How am I using my talents to help society? Because the most powerful lesson
here is, if more people lived their lives trying to be famous in death, the world would be
a much better place. Thank you.
