title: Why you should get paid for your data
speaker: Jennifer Zhu Scott
description: >-
 The world's most valuable tech companies profit from the personal data you
 generate. So why aren't you getting paid for it? In this eye-opening talk,
 entrepreneur and technologist Jennifer Zhu Scott makes the case for private data
 ownership -- which would empower you to donate, destroy or sell your data as you
 see fit -- and shows how this growing movement could put power (and cash) back
 into the hands of people.

I grew up in the late '70s in rural China during the final years of my country's pursuit
of absolute equality at the expense of liberty. At that time, everybody had a job, but
everyone was struggling. In the early '80s, my dad was an electrician, and my mom worked
two shifts in the local hospital. But still, we didn't have enough food, and our living
conditions were dismal. We were undoubtedly equal — we were equally poor. The state owned
everything. We owned nothing. The story I'm going to share with you is about my struggles
of overcoming adversity with my resilience, grit and sheer determination. No, I'm just
kidding, I'm not going to do that to you.

Instead, I'm going to tell you, what I'm going to talk about today is about a new form of
collective poverty that many of us don't recognize and that urgently needs to be
understood. I'm sure you've noticed that in the past 20 years, that asset has emerged. It's
been generating wealth at a breakneck pace. As a tool, it has brought businesses deep
customer insights, operational efficiency and enormous top-line growth. But for some, it
has also provided a device to manipulate a democratic election or perform surveillance for
profit or political purposes. What is this miracle asset? You've guessed it: it's
data. Seven out of the top 10 most valuable companies in the world are tech companies that
either directly generate profit from data or are empowered by data from the core. Multiple
surveys show that the vast majority of business decision makers regard data as an
essential asset for success.

We have all experienced how data is shifting this major paradigm shift for our personal,
economic and political lives. Whoever owns the data owns the future. But who's producing
the data? I assume everyone in this room has a smartphone, several social media accounts
and has done a Google search or two in the past week. We are all producing data. Yes. It is
estimated that by 2030, 10 years from now, there will be about 125 billion connected
devices in the world. That's an average of about 15 devices per person. We are already
producing data every day. We'll be producing exponentially more. Google, Facebook and
Tencent's combined revenue in 2018 was 236 billion US dollars. Now, how many of you have
received payment from them for the data you generate for them? None, right? Data has
immense value but is centrally controlled and owned. You are all walking raw materials for
those large data companies, but none of you are paid. Not only that, you're not even
considered as part of this equation for income.

So once again, we are undoubtedly equal: we're equally poor. Somebody else owns
everything, and we own nothing. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? So what should we do? There
might be some clues in how my life turned out after that difficult start. Things began to
look up for my family in the '80s. The system evolved, and people began to be allowed to
own a piece of what we created. "People diving into the ocean," or "xia hai," the Chinese
term, described those who left state-owned enterprise jobs and started their own
businesses. Private ownership of a business became personal ownership of cars, properties,
food, clothes and things. The economic machine started rolling, and people's lives began
to improve. For the first time, to get rich was glorious. So in the '90s, when I went to
study in Chengdu in west China, many young individuals like myself were well-positioned to
take advantage of the new system.

After I graduated from my university, I cofounded my first business and moved to Shenzhen,
the brand-new special economic zone that used to be a fishing village. Twenty years later,
Shenzhen has become a global innovation powerhouse. Private ownership was a form of liberty
we didn't have before. It created unprecedented opportunities for our generations,
motivating us to work and study incredibly hard. The result was that more than 850 million
people rose out of poverty. According to the World Bank, China's extreme poverty rate in
1981, when I was a little kid, was 88 percent. By 2015, 0.7 percent. I am a product of
that success, and I am very happy to share that today, I have my own AI business, and I
lead a very worldly and dynamic life, a path that was unimaginable when I was a kid in
west China. Of course, this prosperity came with a trade-off, with equality, the
environment and freedom. And obviously I'm not here to argue that China has it all figured
out. We haven't.

Nor that data is fully comparable to physical assets. It is not. But my life experience
allowed me to see what's hiding in plain sight. Currently, the public discourse is so
focused on the regulatory and privacy issue when it comes to data ownership. But I want to
ask: What if we look at data ownership in completely different ways? What if data
ownership is, in fact, a personal, individual and economic issue? What if, in the new
digital economy, we are allowed to own a piece of what we create and give people the
liberty of private data ownership? The legal concept of ownership is when you can possess,
use, gift, pass on, destroy or trade it or sell your asset at a price accepted by you.
What if we give that same definition to individuals' data, so individuals can use or
destroy our data or we trade it at our chosen price? Now, I know some of you might say, "I
would never, ever trade my data for any amount of money." But that, let me remind you, is
exactly what you're doing now, except you're giving your data away for
free.

Plus, privacy is a very personal and nuanced issue. You might have the privilege to
prioritize your privacy over money, but for millions of small business owners in China who
can't get bank loans easily, using their data to gain rapid loan approval from AI-powered
lenders can answer their more pressing needs. What's private to you is different from
what's private to others. What's private to you now is different from what was private
when you were in college. Or, at least, I hope so.

We are always, although often subconsciously, making such trade-offs based on our diverse
personal beliefs and life priorities. That is why data ownership would be incomplete
without a pricing power. By assigning pricing power to individuals, we gain a tool to
reflect our personal and nuanced preferences. So, for example, you could choose to donate
your data for free if a contribution to a particular medical research is very meaningful
for you. Or, if we had the tools to set our behavior data at a price of, say, 100,000 US
dollars, I doubt any political group would be able to target or manipulate your vote. You
control. You decide. Now, I know this sounds probably implausible, but trends are already
pointing to a growing and very powerful individual data ownership movement. First,
start-ups are already creating tools to allow us to take back some control. A new browser
called Brave empowers users with "Brave Shields" — they literally call it that — by
aggressively blocking data-grabbing ads and trackers, and avoid leaking data like other
browsers.

In return, users can take back some bargaining and pricing power. When users opt in to
accept ads, Brave rewards users with "basic attention tokens" that can redeem content
behind paywalls from publishers. And I've been using Brave for a few months. It has
already blocked more than 200,000 ads and trackers and saved hours of my time. Now, I know
some of you interact with your browser more than with your partners, so
—

you should at least find one that doesn't waste your time and is not creepy.

Do you think Google is indispensable? Think again. A search engine is indispensable.
Google just has the monopoly — for now. A search engine called DuckDuckGo doesn't store
your personal information or follow you around with ads or track your personal browsing
history. Instead, it gives all users the same search results instead of based on your
personal browsing records. In London, a company called digi.me offers an app you can
download on your smartphone that helps to import and consolidate your data generated by
you from your Fitbit, Spotify, social media accounts ... And you can choose where to store
your data, and digi.me will help you to make your data work for you by providing insights
that used to be exclusively accessible by large data companies. In DC, a new initiative
called UBDI, U-B-D-I, Universal Basic Data Income, helps people to make money by sharing
anonymous insights through their data for companies that can use them for market
research.

And whenever a company purchases a study, users get paid in cash and UBDI points to track
their contribution, potentially as much as 1,000 US dollars per year per their estimation.
UBDI could be a very feasible path for universal basic income in the AI economy. Further,
individual awareness of privacy and data ownership is growing fast as we all become aware
of this monster we have unleashed in our pocket. I'm a mother of two preteen girls, and
trust me, the single biggest source of stress and anxiety as a parent, for me, is my
children's relationship with technology. This is a three-page agreement my husband and I
make them sign before they receive their first [mobile phone].

We want to help them to become digital citizens, but only if we can make them become smart
and responsible ones. I help them to understand what kind of data should never be shared.
So if you Google me, in fact — actually, sorry — if you DuckDuckGo me, you will find maybe
a lot about me and my work, but you may find no information about my daughters. When they
grow up, if they want to put themselves out there, it's their choice, not mine, despite
that I insist they're the most beautiful, smartest and most extraordinary kids in the
world, of course. And I know many people are having similar conversations and making
similar decisions, which gives me hope that a truly smart data-rich future will be here
soon. But I want to highlight the Clause 6 of this agreement. It says, "I will never, ever
search for any information online if I would be embarrassed if seen by Grandma
Dawnie."

Try it. It's really effective.

Throughout history, there has always been a trade-off between liberty and equality in the
pursuit of prosperity. The world has constantly been going through the circle of wealth
accumulation to wealth redistribution. As the tension between the haves and have-nots is
breaking so many countries, it is in everyone's interest, including the large data
companies, to prevent this new form of inequality. Of course, individual data ownership is
not the perfect nor the complete answer to this profoundly complex question of what makes
a good digital society. But according to McKinsey, AI will add 13 trillion US dollars of
economic output in the next 10 years. Data generated by individuals will no doubt
contribute to this enormous growth. Shouldn't we at least consider an economic model that
empowers the people? And if private ownership helped to lift more than 850 million people
out of poverty, it is our duty and we owe it to future generations to create a more
inclusive AI economy that will empower the people in addition to businesses. Thank
you.
