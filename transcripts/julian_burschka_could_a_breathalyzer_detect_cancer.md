 How is it that a breathalyzer can measure the alcohol content in someone's blood,
 hours after they had their last drink, based on their breath alone? And could we
 use this same technology to detect disease by analyzing a person's breath,

How is it that a breathalyzer can measure the alcohol content in someone’s blood, hours
after they had their last drink, based on their breath alone? Exhaled breath contains
trace amounts of hundreds, even thousands, of volatile organic compounds: small molecules
lightweight enough to travel easily as gases. One of these is ethanol, which we consume
in alcoholic drinks. It travels through the bloodstream to tiny air sacs in the lungs,
passing into exhaled air at a concentration 2,000 times lower, on average, than in the
blood. When someone breathes into a breathalyzer, the ethanol in their breath passes into
a reaction chamber. There, it’s converted to another molecule, called acetic acid, in a
special type of reactor that produces an electric current during the reaction. The
strength of the current indicates the amount of ethanol in the sample of air, and by
extension in the blood. In addition to the volatile organic compounds like ethanol we
consume in food and drink, the biochemical processes of our cells produce many
others.

And when something disrupts those processes, like a disease, the collection of volatile 
organic compounds in the breath may change, too. So could we detect disease by analyzing
a person’s breath, without using more invasive diagnostic tools like biopsies, blood
draws, and radiation? In theory, yes, but testing for disease is a lot more complicated
than testing for alcohol. To identify diseases, researchers need to look at a set of tens
of compounds in the breath. A given disease may cause some of these compounds to increase
or decrease in concentration, while others may not change— the profile is likely to be
different for every disease, and could even vary for different stages of the same
disease. For example, cancers are among the most researched candidates for diagnosis
through breath analysis. One of the biochemical changes many tumors cause is a large
increase in an energy-generating process called glycolysis.

Known as the Warburg Effect, this increase in glycolysis results in an increase of
metabolites like lactate which in turn can affect a whole cascade of metabolic processes
and ultimately result in altered breath composition, possibly including an increased 
concentration of volatile compounds such as dimethyl sulfide. But the Warburg Effect is
just one potential indicator of cancerous activity, and doesn’t reveal anything about
the particular type of cancer. Many more indicators are needed to make a diagnosis. To
find these subtle differences, researchers compare the breath of healthy people with the
breath of people who suffer from a particular disease using profiles based on hundreds 
of breath samples. This complex analysis requires a fundamentally different, more
versatile type of sensor from the alcohol breathalyzer. There are a few being developed.
Some discriminate between individual compounds by observing how the compounds move 
through a set of electric fields.

Others use an array of resistors made of different materials that each change their
resistance when exposed to a certain mix of volatile organic compounds. There are other
challenges too. These substances are present at incredibly low concentrations— typically
just parts per billion, much lower than ethanol concentrations in the breath. Compounds’
levels may be affected by factors other than disease, including age, gender, nutrition, 
and lifestyle. Finally, there’s the issue of distinguishing which compounds in the sample
were produced in the patient’s body and which were inhaled from the environment shortly
before the test. Because of these challenges, breath analysis isn’t quite ready yet. But
preliminary clinical trials on lung, colon, and other cancers have had encouraging
results. One day, catching cancer early might be as easy as breathing in and
out.
