title: How we experience awe -- and why it matters
speaker: Beau Lotto and Cirque du Soleil
description: >-
 Neuroscientist Beau Lotto conducted an ambitious study with Cirque du Soleil on
 the emotion of awe and its psychological and behavioral benefits. In this talk
 and live performance, he shares some of their findings -- and stands back as
 Cirque du Soleil dancers create their own awe-inducing spectacle.

Before I get started: I'm really excited to be here to just actually watch what's going to
happen, from here. So with that said, we're going to start with: What is one of our
greatest needs, one of our greatest needs for our brain? And instead of telling you, I
want to show you. In fact, I want you to feel it. There's a lot I want you to feel in the
next 14 minutes. So, if we could all stand up. We're all going to conduct a piece of
Strauss together. Alright? And you all know it. Alright. Are you ready? Audience: Yeah!
Beau Lotto: Alright. Ready, one, two, three! It's just the end.(Music: Richard Strauss
"Also Sprach Zarathustra")Right? You know where it's going.

Oh, it's coming!(Music stops abruptly)Oh!

Right? Collective coitus interruptus. OK, you can all sit down.

We have a fundamental need for closure.

We love closure.

I was told the story that Mozart, just before he'd go to bed, he'd go to the piano and go,
"da-da-da-da-da." His father, who was already in bed, would think, "Argh." He'd have to
get up and hit the final note to the chord before he could go back to sleep.

So the need for closure leads us to thinking about: What is our greatest fear? Think —
what is our greatest fear growing up, even now? And it's the fear of the dark. We hate
uncertainty. We hate to not know. We hate it. Think about horror films. Horror films are
always shot in the dark, in the forest, at night, in the depths of the sea, the blackness
of space. And the reason is because dying was easy during evolution. If you weren't sure
that was a predator, it was too late. Your brain evolved to predict. And if you couldn't
predict, you died. And the way your brain predicts is by encoding the bias and assumptions
that were useful in the past. But those assumptions just don't stay inside your brain. You
project them out into the world. There is no bird there. You're projecting the meaning
onto the screen. Everything I'm saying to you right now is literally meaningless.

You're creating the meaning and projecting it onto me. And what's true for objects is true
for other people. While you can measure their "what" and their "when," you can never
measure their "why." So we color other people. We project a meaning onto them based on our
biases and our experience. Which is why the best of design is almost always about
decreasing uncertainty. So when we step into uncertainty, our bodies respond
physiologically and mentally. Your immune system will start deteriorating. Your brain
cells wither and even die. Your creativity and intelligence decrease. We often go from
fear to anger, almost too often. Why? Because fear is a state of certainty. You become
morally judgmental. You become an extreme version of yourself. If you're a conservative,
you become more conservative. If you're a liberal, you become more liberal. Because you go
to a place of familiarity. The problem is that the world changes. And we have to adapt or
die.

And if you want to shift from A to B, the first step is not B. The first step is to go
from A to not A — to let go of your bias and assumptions; to step into the very place that
our brain evolved to avoid; to step into the place of the unknown. But it's so essential
that we go to this place that our brain gave us a solution. Evolution gave us a solution.
And it's possibly one of the most profound perceptual experiences. And it's the experience
of awe.

Beau Lotto: Ah, how wonderful, right? So right now, you're probably all feeling, at some
level or another, awe. Right? So what's happening inside your brain right now? And for
thousands of years, we've been thinking and writing and experiencing awe, and we know so
little about it. And so to try to understand what is it and what does it do, my Lab of
Misfits had just the wonderful opportunity and the pleasure to work with who are some of
the greatest creators of awe that we know: the writers, the creators, the directors, the
accountants, the people who are Cirque Du Soleil. And so we went to Las Vegas, and we
recorded the brain activity of people while they're watching the performance, over 10
performances of "O," which is iconic Cirque performance. And we also measured the behavior
before the performance, as well as a different group after the performance. And so we had
over 200 people involved. So what is awe? What is happening inside your brain right now?
It's a brain state. OK?

The front part of your brain, the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for your
executive function, your attentional control, is now being downregulated. The part of your
brain called the DMN, default mode network, which is the interaction between multiple
areas in your brain, which is active during, sort of, ideation, creative thinking in terms
of divergent thinking and daydreaming, is now being upregulated. And right about now, the
activity in your prefrontal cortex is changing. It's becoming asymmetrical in its
activity, biased towards the right, which is highly correlated when people step forward
into the world, as opposed to step back. In fact, the activity across the brains of all
these people was so correlated that we're able to train an artificial neural network to
predict whether or not people are experiencing awe to an accuracy of 75 percent on
average, with a maximum of 83 percent. So what does this brain state do?

Well, others have demonstrated, for instance, Professors Haidt and Keltner, have told us
that people feel small but connected to the world. And their prosocial behavior increases,
because they feel an increased affinity towards others. And we've also shown in this study
that people have less need for cognitive control. They're more comfortable with
uncertainty without having closure. And their appetite for risk also increases. They
actually seek risk, and they are better able at taking it. And something that was really
quite profound is that when we asked people, "Are you someone who has a propensity to
experience awe?" They were more likely to give a positive response after the performance
than they were [before]. They literally redefined themselves and their history. So, awe is
possibly the perception that is bigger than us. And in the words of Joseph Campbell, "Awe
is what enables us to move forward." Or in the words of a dear friend, probably one of our
greatest photographers, still living photographers, Duane Michaels, he said to me just the
other day that maybe it gives us the curiosity to overcome our cowardice. So who
cares?

Why should we care? Well, consider conflict, which seems to be so omnipresent in our
society at the moment. If you and I are in conflict, it's as if we're at the opposite ends
of the same line. And my aim is to prove that you're wrong and to shift you towards me.
The problem is, you are doing exactly the same. You're trying to prove that I'm wrong and
shift me towards you. Notice that conflict is the setup to win but not learn. Your brain
only learns if we move. Life is movement. So, what if we could use awe, not to get rid of
conflict — conflict is essential, conflict is how your brain expands, it's how your brain
learns — but rather, to enter conflict in a different way? And what if awe could enable us
to enter it in at least two different ways? One, to give us the humility and courage to
not know. Right? To enter conflict with a question instead of an answer. What would happen
then? To enter the conflict with uncertainty instead of certainty.

And the second is, in entering conflict that way, to seek to understand, rather than
convince. Because everyone makes sense to themselves, right? And to understand another
person, is to understand the biases and assumptions that give rise to their behavior. And
we've actually initiated a pilot study to look to see whether we could use art-induced awe
to facilitate toleration. And the results are actually incredibly positive. We can
mitigate against anger and hate through the experience of awe generated by art. So where
can we find awe, given how important it is? So, what if ... A suggestion: that awe is not
just to be found in the grandeur. Awe is essential. Often, it's scale — the mountains, the
sunscape. But what if we could actually rescale ourselves and find the impossible in the
simple? And if this is true, and our data are right, then endeavors like science,
adventure, art, ideas, love, a TED conference, performance, are not only inspired by awe,
but could actually be our ladders into uncertainty to help us expand. Thank you very
much.

Please, come up.
