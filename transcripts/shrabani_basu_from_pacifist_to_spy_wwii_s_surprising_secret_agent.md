Noor Inayat Khan was in the midst of a desperate escape. She had been imprisoned for her
activities as an Allied spy, but with the help of a screwdriver and two other prisoners,
she was back under the Parisian stars. As she began to run, her thoughts leapt to the
whirlwind of events that had brought her here…Born in Moscow in 1914 to an Indian Muslim
father and an American mother, Noor was raised in a profoundly peaceful home. Her parents
were Sufi pacifists, who put their faith in the power of music and compassion. They moved
to Paris, where Noor studied child psychology and published children’s books. But all
this changed with the advent of the Second World War. In May 1940, with the German army 
ready to occupy Paris, Noor and her brother were faced with a difficult choice. As
pacifists, they believed that all disputes should be settled non-violently. But
witnessing the devastation across Europe, they decided that standing on the sidelines
was not an option. Traveling to England, Noor volunteered for the Women’s Auxiliary Air
Force and trained as a radio operator.

She immersed herself in wireless operations and Morse code– unaware that she was being
monitored by a secret organization. The British Special Operations Executive was
established to sabotage the Germans in Nazi-occupied countries. As a trained radio
operator who knew Paris well and spoke fluent French, Noor was an attractive recruit. In
her interview, she was warned that wireless operation was some of the most dangerous work
 in the intelligence field. Operators had to lug a conspicuous transmitter through enemy
territory, and the clandestine agency couldn’t protect her if she was caught. Noor
accepted her assignment immediately. While she was determined to take her pacifist
principles as far as possible, Noor had to learn the art of espionage. She learned how to
contact intelligence networks, pick a lock, resist interrogation and fire a gun. In June
1943 she landed in Angers, south of Paris, and made her way to the city armed with a
false passport, a pistol and a few French francs.

But her network was compromised. Within a week of her deployment, all her fellow agents
were arrested, and Noor was called home. She convinced her supervisors to let her stay–
which meant doing the work of six radio operators singlehandedly. Over the following
months, she tracked and transported supplies to the French resistance, sent reports of
Nazi activity back to London and arranged safe passage for allied soldiers. This work
was essential to building the French resistance and Allied intelligence networks– and,
ultimately, ending the war. Protected only by her quick thinking and charisma, she
frequently talked her way out of questioning. When the Gestapo searched her on the
train, she gave them a casual tour of her “film projector.” When an officer spotted her
hanging her aerial, she chatted about her passion for listening to music on the radio–
and charmed him into helping her set up the cable.

In her entire four month tenure, her sharp wits and stealth never failed her. But her
charm had inspired lethal jealousy. In October 1943, the sister of a colleague, in love
with an agent that loved Noor, sold her address to the Gestapo. Noor refused to give away
any information, focusing instead on her escape. Secreting a screwdriver away from the
guards, they were able to loosen a skylight and slip out into the night. But just as the
prisoners began to run for their lives, an air raid siren alerted her captors. Noor was
caught once again and sent to a German prison. Then, on to Dachau concentration
camp. Despite being tortured, deprived and isolated, Noor gave nothing away. In the
moments before her execution she is thought to have shouted “Liberté!” Since her heroic
sacrifice, Noor has been honoured as a hero who waged secret battles behind enemy lines–
paving the way for freedom without ever taking a life.
