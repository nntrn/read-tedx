title: The biology of gender, from DNA to the brain
speaker: Karissa Sanbonmatsu
description: >-
 How exactly does gender work? It's not just about our chromosomes, says biologist
 Karissa Sanbonmatsu. In a visionary talk, she shares new discoveries from
 epigenetics, the emerging study of how DNA activity can permanently change based
 on social factors like trauma or diet. Learn how life experiences shape the way
 genes are expressed -- and what that means for our understanding of gender.

So what does it mean to be a woman? We all have XX chromosomes, right? Actually, that's
not true. Some women are mosaics. They have a mix of chromosome types with X, with XY or
with XXX. If it's not just about our chromosomes, then what is being a woman about? Being
feminine? Getting married? Having kids? You don't have to look far to find fantastic
exceptions to these rules, but we all share something that makes us women. Maybe that
something is in our brains. You might have heard theories from last century about how men
are better at math than women because they have bigger brains. These theories have been
debunked. The average man has a brain about three times smaller than the average elephant,
but that doesn't mean the average man is three times dumber than an elephant ... or does
it?

There's a new wave of female neuroscientists that are finding important differences
between female and male brains in neuron connectivity, in brain structure, in brain
activity. They're finding that the brain is like a patchwork mosaic — a mixture. Women
have mostly female patches and a few male patches. With all this new data, what does it
mean to be a woman? This is something that I've been thinking about almost my entire life.
When people learn that I'm a woman who happens to be transgender, they always ask, "How do
you know you're a woman?" As a scientist, I'm searching for a biological basis of gender.
I want to understand what makes me me. New discoveries at the front edge of science are
shedding light on the biomarkers that define gender. My colleagues and I in genetics,
neuroscience, physiology and psychology, we're trying to figure out exactly how gender
works. These vastly different fields share a common connection — epigenetics.

In epigenetics, we're studying how DNA activity can actually radically and permanently
change, even though the sequence stays the same. DNA is the long, string-like molecule that
winds up inside our cells. There's so much DNA that it actually gets tangled into these
knot-like things — we'll just call them knots. So external factors change how those DNA
knots are formed. You can think of it like this: inside our cells, there's different
contraptions building things, connecting circuits, doing all the things they need to make
life happen. Here's one that's sort of reading the DNA and making RNA. And then this one
is carrying a huge sac of neurotransmitters from one end of the brain cell to the other.
Don't they get hazard pay for this kind of work?

This one is an entire molecular factory — some say it's the secret to life. It's call the
ribosome. I've been studying this since 2001.One of the stunning things about our cells is
that the components inside them are actually biodegradable. They dissolve, and then
they're rebuilt each day, kind of like a traveling carnival where the rides are taken down
and then rebuilt every single day. A big difference between our cells and the traveling
carnival is that in the carnival, there are skilled craftsmen that rebuild the rides each
day. In our cells, there are no such skilled craftsmen, only dumb builder machines that
build whatever's written in the plans, no matter what those plans say. Those plans are the
DNA. The instructions for every nook and cranny inside our cells. If everything in, say,
our brain cells dissolves almost every day, then how can the brain remember anything past
one day? That's where DNA comes in. DNA is one of the those things that does not
dissolve.

But for DNA to remember that something happened, it has to change somehow. We know the
change can't be in the sequence; if it changed sequence all the time, then we might be
growing like, a new ear or a new eyeball every single day.

So, instead it changes shape, and that's where those DNA knots come in. You can think of
them like DNA memory. When something big in our life happens, like a traumatic childhood
event, stress hormones flood our brain. The stress hormones don't affect the sequence of
DNA, but they do change the shape. They affect that part of DNA with the instructions for
molecular machines that reduce stress. That piece of DNA gets wound up into a knot, and
now the dumb builder machines can't read the plans they need to build the machines that
reduce stress. That's a mouthful, but it's what's happening on the microscale. On the
macroscale, you practically lose the ability to deal with stress, and that's bad. And
that's how DNA can remember what happens in the past. This is what I think was happening to
me when I first started my gender transition. I knew I was a woman on the inside, and I
wore women's clothes on the outside, but everyone saw me as a man in a
dress.

I felt like no matter how many things I try, no one would ever really see me as a woman.
In science, your credibility is everything, and people were snickering in the hallways,
giving me stares, looks of disgust — afraid to be near me. I remember my first big talk
after transition. It was in Italy. I'd given prestigious talks before, but this one, I was
terrified. I looked out into the audience, and the whispers started — the stares, the
smirks, the chuckles. To this day, I still have social anxiety around my experience eight
years ago. I lost hope. Don't worry, I've had therapy so I'm OK — I'm OK
now.

But I felt enough is enough: I'm a scientist, I have a doctorate in astrophysics, I've
published in the top journals, in wave-particle interactions, space physics, nucleic acid
biochemistry. I've actually been trained to get to the bottom of things, so
—

I went online —

So I went online, and I found fascinating research papers. I learned that these DNA knot
things are not always bad. Actually, the knotting and unknotting — it's like a complicated
computer language. It programs our bodies with exquisite precision. So when we get
pregnant, our fertilized eggs grow into newborn babies. This process requires thousands of
DNA decisions to happen. Should an embryo cell become a blood cell? A heart cell? A brain
cell? And the decisions happen at different times during pregnancy. Some in the first
trimester, some in the second trimester and some in the third trimester. To truly
understand DNA decision-making, we need to see the process of knot formation in atomic
detail. Even the most powerful microscopes can't see this. What if we tried to simulate
these on a computer? For that we'd need a million computers to do that. That's exactly
what we have at Los Alamos Labs — a million computers connected in a giant warehouse. So
here we're showing the DNA making up an entire gene folded into very specific shapes of
knots.

For the first time, my team has simulated an entire gene of DNA — the largest biomolecular
simulation performed to date. For the first time, we're beginning to understand the
unsolved problem of how hormones trigger the formation of these knots. DNA knot formation
can be seen beautifully in calico cats. The decision between orange and black happens
early on in the womb, so that orange-and-black patchy pattern, it's an exact readout of
what happened when that cat was just a tiny little kitten embryo inside her mom's womb.
And the patchy pattern actually happens in our brains and in cancer. It's directly related
to intellectual disability and breast cancer. These DNA decisions also happen in other
parts of the body. It turns out that the precursor genitals transform into either female
or male during the first trimester of pregnancy. The precursor brains, on the other hand,
transform into female or male during the second trimester of pregnancy.

So the current working model is that a unique mix in my mom's womb caused the precursor
genitals to transform one way, but the precursor brain to transform the other way. Most of
epigenetic research has really focused on stress, anxiety, depression — kind of a downer,
kind of bad things.

But nowadays — the latest stuff — people are looking at relaxation. Can that have a
positive effect on your DNA? Right now we're missing key data from mice models. We know
that mice relax, but could they meditate like the Dalai Lama? Achieve enlightenment? Could
they move stones with their mind like Jedi Master Yoda?(Yoda voice): Hm, a Jedi mouse must
feel the force flow, hm.

I wonder if the support I've had since that talk back in Italy has tried to unwind my DNA.
Having a great circle of friends, supportive parents and being in a loving relationship
has actually given me strength and hope to help others. At work I wear a rainbow bracelet.
Sometimes it raises eyebrows, but it also raises awareness. There's so many transgender
people — especially women of color — that are just one demeaning comment away from taking
their own lives. Forty percent of us attempt suicide. If you're listening and you feel
like you have no other option, try to call a friend, go online or try to get in a support
group. If you're a woman who's not transgender but you know pain of isolation, of sexual
assault — reach out. So what does it mean to be a woman? The latest research is showing
that female and male brains do develop differently in the womb, possibly giving us females
this innate sense of being a woman.

On the other hand, maybe it's our shared sense of commonality that makes us women. We come
in so many different shapes and sizes that asking what it means to be a woman may not be
the right question. It's like asking a calico cat what it means to be a calico cat. Maybe
becoming a woman means accepting ourselves for who we really are and acknowledging the
same in each other. I see you. And you've just seen me.(Applause and cheers)
