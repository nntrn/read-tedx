title: Is marijuana bad for your brain?

 In 1970, marijuana was classified as a schedule 1 drug in the United States: the
 strictest designation possible, meaning it was completely illegal and had no
 recognized medical uses. Today, marijuana's therapeutic benefits are widely
 acknowledged, but a growing recognition for its medical value doesn't answer the
 question: is recreational marijuana use bad for your brain? Anees Bahji
 investigates. [Directed by Anton Bogaty, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by

In 1970, marijuana was classified as a schedule 1 drug in the United States: the
strictest designation possible, meaning it was completely illegal and had no recognized
medical uses. For decades, this view persisted and set back research on the drug's
mechanisms and effects. Today, marijuana’s therapeutic benefits are widely acknowledged,
and some nations have legalized medical use or are moving in that direction. But a
growing recognition for marijuana’s medical value doesn’t answer the question: is
recreational marijuana use bad for your brain? Marijuana acts on the body’s cannabinoid
system, which has receptors all over the brain and body. Molecules native to the body, 
called endocannabinoids, also act on these receptors. We don’t totally understand the
cannabinoid system, but it has one feature that provides a big clue to its function. Most
neurotransmitters travel from one neuron to the next through a synapse to propagate a
message.

But endocannabinoids travel in the opposite direction. When a message passes from the
one neuron to the next, the receiving neuron releases endocannabinoids. Those
endocannabinoids travel backward to influence the sending neuron— essentially giving it
feedback from the receiving neuron. This leads scientists to believe that the
endocannabinoid system serves primarily to modulate other kinds of signals— amplifying
some and diminishing others. Feedback from endocannabinoids slows down rates of neural
signaling. That doesn’t necessarily mean it slows down behavior or perception, though.
For example, slowing down a signal that inhibits smell could actually make smells more
intense. Marijuana contains two main active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, and
cannabidiol, or CBD. THC is thought to be primarily responsible for marijuana’s
psychoactive effects on behavior, cognition, and perception, while CBD is responsible for
the non-psychoactive effects.

Like endocannabinoids, THC slows down signaling by binding to cannabinoid receptors. But
it binds to receptors all over this sprawling, diffuse system at once, whereas
endocannabinoids are released in a specific place in response to a specific stimulus. This
widespread activity coupled with the fact that the cannabinoid system indirectly affects
many other systems, means that each person’s particular brain chemistry, genetics, and
previous life experience largely determine how they experience the drug. That’s true much
more so with marijuana than with other drugs that produce their effects through one or a
few specific pathways. So the harmful effects, if any, vary considerably from person to
person. And while we don’t know how exactly how marijuana produces specific harmful
effects, there are clear risk factors that can increase peoples’ likelihood of
experiencing them. The clearest risk factor is age.

In people younger than 25, cannabinoid receptors are more concentrated in the white
matter than in people over 25. The white matter is involved in communication, learning,
memory, and emotions. Frequent marijuana use can disrupt the development of white matter
tracts, and also affect the brain’s ability to grow new connections. This may damage
long-term learning ability and problem solving. For now, it’s unclear how severe this
damage can be or whether it’s reversible. And even among young people, the risk is higher
the younger someone is— much higher for a 15 year old than a 22 year old, for
instance. Marijuana can also cause hallucinations or paranoid delusions. Known as
marijuana-induced psychosis, these symptoms usually subside when a person stops using
marijuana. But in rare cases, psychosis doesn’t subside, instead unmasking a persistent
psychotic disorder. A family history of psychotic disorders, like schizophrenia, is the
clearest, though not the only, risk factor for this effect.

Marijuana-induced psychosis is also more common among young adults, though it’s worth
noting that psychotic disorders usually surface in this age range anyway. What’s unclear
in these cases is whether the psychotic disorder would have appeared without marijuana
use— whether marijuana use triggers it early, is a catalyst for a tipping point that
wouldn’t have been crossed otherwise, or whether the reaction to marijuana is merely an
indication of an underlying disorder. In all likelihood, marijuana’s role varies from
person to person. At any age, as with many other drugs, the brain and body become less
sensitive to marijuana after repeated uses, meaning it takes more to achieve the same
effects. Fortunately, unlike many other drugs, there’s no risk of fatal overdose from
marijuana, and even heavy use doesn’t lead to debilitating or life-threatening 
withdrawal symptoms if use stops.

There are more subtle forms of marijuana withdrawal, though, including sleep
disturbances, irritability, and depressed mood, which pass within a few weeks of
stopping use. So is marijuana bad for your brain? It depends who you are. But while some
risk factors are easy to identify, others aren’t well understood— which means there’s
still some possibility of experiencing negative effects, even if you don’t have any of
the known risk factors.
