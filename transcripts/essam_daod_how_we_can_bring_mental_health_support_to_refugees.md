title: How we can bring mental health support to refugees
speaker: Essam Daod
description: >-
 The global refugee crisis is a mental health catastrophe, leaving millions in
 need of psychological support to overcome the traumas of dislocation and
 conflict. To undo the damage, child psychiatrist and TED Fellow Essam Daod has
 been working in camps, rescue boats and the shorelines of Greece and the
 Mediterranean Sea to help refugees (a quarter of which are children) reframe
 their experiences through short, powerful psychological interventions. "We can
 all do something to prevent this mental health catastrophe," Daod says. "We need
 to acknowledge that first aid is not just needed for the body, but it has also to
 include the mind, the soul."

For the last two and a half years, I'm one of the few, if not the only, child psychiatrist
operating in refugee camps, shorelines and rescue boats in Greece and the Mediterranean
Sea. And I can say, with great confidence, that we are witnessing a mental-health
catastrophe that will affect most of us, and it will change our world. I live in Haifa, but
nowadays, I spend most of my time abroad. During my time on the Greek island of Lesbos and
on the rescue boats in the Mediterranean, thousands of refugee boats arrived to the
shoreline, crowded with more than 1.5 million refugees. One-fourth of them are children,
fleeing war and hardship. Each boat carries different sufferings and traumas from Syria,
Iraq, Afganistan and different countries in Africa. In the last three years alone, more
than 12,000 refugees lost their lives. And hundreds of thousands lost their souls and
their mental health due to this cruel and traumatic experience. I want to tell you about
Omar, a five-year-old Syrian refugee boy who arrived to the shore on Lesbos on a crowded
rubber boat.

Crying, frightened, unable to understand what's happening to him, he was right on the
verge of developing a new trauma. I knew right away that this was a golden hour, a short
period of time in which I could change his story, I could change the story that he would
tell himself for the rest of his life. I could reframe his memories. I quickly held out my
hands and said to his shaking mother in Arabic,

"Ateeni elwalad o khudi nafas." "Give me the boy, and take a breath." His mother gave him
to me. Omar looked at me with scared, tearful eyes and said, 

"Ammo (uncle in Arabic), shu hada?" "What is this?" as he pointed out to the police
helicopter hovering above us."It's a helicopter! It's here to photograph you with big
cameras, because only the great and the powerful heroes, like you, Omar, can cross the
sea."Omar looked at me, stopped crying and asked me, 

"Ana batal?" "I'm a hero?"I talked to Omar for 15 minutes. And I gave his parents some
guidance to follow. This short psychological intervention decreases the prevalence of
post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health issues in the future, preparing
Omar to get an education, join the workforce, raise a family and beyond. How? By
stimulating the good memories that will be stored in the amygdala, the emotional storage
of the human brain. These memories will fight the traumatic ones, if they are reactivated
in the future. To Omar, the smell of the sea will not just remind him of his traumatic
journey from Syria. Because to Omar, this story is now a story of bravery. This is the
power of the golden hour, which can reframe the trauma and establish a new narrative. But
Omar is only one out of more than 350,000 children without the proper mental health
support in this crisis alone. Three hundred and fifty thousand children and me. We need
mental health professionals to join rescue teams during times of active
crisis.

This is why my wife and I and friends co-founded "Humanity Crew." One of the few aid
organizations in the world that specializes in providing psychosocial aid and
first-response mental health interventions to refugees and displaced populations. To
provide them with a suitable intervention, we create the four-step approach, a
psychosocial work plan that follows the refugees on each step of their journey. Starting
inside the sea, on the rescue boats, as mental health lifeguards. Later in the camps,
hospitals and through our online clinic that breaks down borders and overcomes languages.
And ending in the asylum countries, helping them integrate. Since our first mission in
2015, "Humanity Crew" had 194 delegations of qualified, trained volunteers and therapists.
We have provided 26,000 hours of mental health support to over 10,000 refugees. We can all
do something to prevent this mental health catastrophe.

We need to acknowledge that first aid is not just needed for the body, but it has also to
include the mind, the soul. The impact on the soul is hardly visible, but the damage can
be there for life. Let's not forget that what distinguishes us humans from machines is the
beautiful and the delicate soul within us. Let's try harder to save more Omars. Thank
you.
