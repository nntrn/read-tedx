title: The hidden opportunities of the informal economy
speaker: Niti Bhan
description: >-
 Niti Bhan studies business strategy for Africa's informal markets: the small
 shops and stands, skilled craftspeople and laborers who are the invisible engine
 that keeps the continent's economy running. It's tempting to think of these
 workers as tax-dodgers, even criminals -- but Bhan makes the case that this
 booming segment of the economy is legitimate and worthy of investment. "These are
 the fertile seeds of businesses and enterprises," Bhan says. "Can we start by
 recognizing these skills and occupations?"

The informal markets of Africa are stereotypically seen as chaotic and lackadaisical. The
downside of hearing the word "informal" is this automatic grand association we have, which
is very negative, and it's had significant consequences and economic losses, easily adding
— or subtracting — 40 to 60 percent of the profit margin for the informal markets alone.
As part of a task of mapping the informal trade ecosystem, we've done an extensive
literature review of all the reports and research on cross-border trade in East Africa,
going back 20 years. This was to prepare us for fieldwork to understand what was the
problem, what was holding back informal trade in the informal sector. What we discovered
over the last 20 years was, nobody had distinguished between illicit — which is like
smuggling or contraband in the informal sector — from the legal but unrecorded, such as
tomatoes, oranges, fruit.

This criminalization — what in Swahili refers to as "biashara," which is the trade or the
commerce, versus "magendo," which is the smuggling or contraband — this criminalization of
the informal sector, in English, by not distinguishing between these aspects, easily can
cost each African economy between 60 to 80 percent addition on the annual GDP growth rate,
because we are not recognizing the engine of what keeps the economies running. The informal
sector is growing jobs at four times the rate of the traditional formal economy, or
"modern" economy, as many call it. It offers employment and income generation
opportunities to the most "unskilled" in conventional disciplines. But can you make a
french fry machine out of an old car? So, this, ladies and gentlemen, is what so
desperately needs to be recognized. As long as the current assumptions hold that this is
criminal, this is shadow, this is illegal, there will be no attempt at integrating the
informal economic ecosystem with the formal or even the global one. I'm going to tell you a
story of Teresia, a trader who overturned all our assumptions, made us question all the
stereotypes that we'd gone in on, based on 20 years of literature review.

Teresia sells clothes under a tree in a town called Malaba, on the border of Uganda and
Kenya. You think it's very simple, don't you? We'll go hang up new clothes from the
branches, put out the tarp, settle down, wait for customers, and there we have it. She was
everything we were expecting according to the literature, to the research, right down to
she was a single mom driven to trade, supporting her kids. So what overturned our
assumptions? What surprised us? First, Teresia paid the county government market fees
every single working day for the privilege of setting up shop under her tree. She's been
doing it for seven years, and she's been getting receipts. She keeps records. We're seeing
not a marginal, underprivileged, vulnerable African woman trader by the side of the road —
no. We were seeing somebody who's keeping sales records for years; somebody who had an
entire ecosystem of retail that comes in from Uganda to pick up inventory; someone who's
got handcarts bringing the goods in, or the mobile money agent who comes to collect cash
at the end of the evening.

Can you guess how much Teresia spends, on average, each month on inventory — stocks of new
clothes that she gets from Nairobi? One thousand five hundred US dollars. That's around
20,000 US dollars invested in trade goods and services every year. This is Teresia, the
invisible one, the hidden middle. And she's only the first rung of the small entrepreneurs,
the micro-businesses that can be found in these market towns. At least in the larger
Malaba border, she's at the first rung. The people further up the value chain are easily
running three lines of business, investing 2,500 to 3,000 US dollars every month. So the
problem turned out that it wasn't the criminalization; you can't really criminalize
someone you're charging receipts from. It's the lack of recognition of their skilled
occupations. The bank systems and structures have no means to recognize them as
micro-businesses, much less the fact that, you know, her tree doesn't have a forwarding
address. So she's trapped in the middle.

She's falling through the cracks of our assumptions. You know all those microloans to help
African women traders? They're going to loan her 50 dollars or 100 dollars. What's she
going to do with it? She spends 10 times that amount every month just on inventory — we're
not talking about the additional services or the support ecosystem. These are the ones who
fit neither the policy stereotype of the low-skilled and the marginalized, nor the
white-collar, salaried office worker or civil servant with a pension that the middle
classes are allegedly composed of. Instead, what we have here are the proto-SMEs these are
the fertile seeds of businesses and enterprises that keep the engines running. They put
food on your table. Even here in this hotel, the invisible ones — the butchers, the bakers
the candlestick makers — they make the machines that make your french fries and they make
your beds. These are the invisible businesswomen trading across borders, all on the side
of the road, and so they're invisible to data gatherers.

And they're mashed together with the vast informal sector that doesn't bother to
distinguish between smugglers and tax evaders and those running illegal whatnot, and the
ladies who trade, and who put food on the table and send their kids to university. So
that's really what I'm asking here. That's all that we need to start by doing. Can we
start by recognizing the skills, the occupations? We could transform the informal economy
by beginning with this recognition and then designing the customized doorways for them to
enter or integrate with the formal, with the global, with the entire system. Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.
