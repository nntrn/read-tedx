title: How to grow a glacier
speaker: M Jackson
description: >-
 In the 13th century, Genghis Khan embarked on a mission to take over Eurasia,
 swiftly conquering countries and drawing them into his empire. But, legend has it
 that there was one obstacle that even he couldn't overcome: a towering wall of
 ice, grown by locals across a mountain pass. M Jackson explores the ancient
 methods of growing glaciers and how they can be used to combat climate change.

In the 13th Century, Genghis Khan embarked on a mission to take over Eurasia, swiftly
conquering countries and drawing them into his expanding Mongol Empire. With his vast
armies he became almost unstoppable. But, legend has it that there was one obstacle that
even the impressive Khan couldn’t overcome: A towering wall of ice, grown by locals
across a mountain pass to stop the Khan’s armies from invading their territory. No one
knows how historically accurate that particular story is, but remarkably, it draws on
fact: For centuries, in the Karakoram and Himalayan mountain ranges, people have been
growing glaciers and using these homemade bodies of ice as sources of drinking water and 
irrigation for their crops. But before we get to that fascinating phenomenon, it’s
important to understand the difference between glaciers that grow in the wild, and those
that humans create. In the wild, glaciers require three conditions to grow: Snowfall, cold
temperatures, and time.

First, a great deal of snow falls and accumulates. Cold temperatures then ensure that the
 stacked up snow persists throughout the winter, spring, summer, and fall. Over the
following years, decades, and centuries, the pressure of the accumulated snow transforms
layers into highly compacted glacial ice. Artificially growing a glacier, however, is
completely different. At the confluence of three great mountain ranges, the Himalayas,
Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, some local cultures have believed for centuries that glaciers
are alive. And what’s more, that certain glaciers can have different genders including
male and female. Local Glacier Growers ‘breed’ new glaciers by grafting together—or
marrying— fragments of ice from male and female glaciers, then covering them with
charcoal, wheat husks, cloths, or willow branches so they can reproduce. Under their
protective coverings, these glacierets transform into fully active glaciers that grow
each year with additional snowfall.

Those then serve as lasting reserves of water that farmers can use to irrigate their
crops. These practices have spread to other cultures, where people are creating their own 
versions of glaciers and applying them to solve serious modern challenges around water
supplies. Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region in northern India. It sits in the
rain shadow of the Himalayas and receives on average fewer than ten centimeters of rain
per year. As local glaciers shrink because of climate change, regional water scarcity is
increasing. And so, local people have started growing their own glaciers as insurance
against this uncertainty. These glaciers come in two types: horizontal, and
vertical. Horizontal glaciers are formed when farmers redirect glacier meltwater into
channels and pipes, then carefully siphon it off into a series of basins made from stones
and earth. Villagers minutely control the release of water into these reservoirs, waiting
for each new layer to freeze before filling the basin with another wave.

In early spring, these frozen pools begin to melt, supplying villagers with irrigation
for their fields. Local people make vertical glaciers using the meltwater from
already-existing glaciers high above their villages. The meltwater enters channels that
run downhill, flowing until it reaches a crop site where it bursts forth from a pipe
pointing straight into the air. When winter temperatures dip, this water freezes as it
arcs out of the pipe, ultimately forming a 50 meter ice sculpture called a stupa, shaped
like an upside-down ice cream cone. This inverted form minimizes the amount of surface
area it exposes to the sun in the spring and summer. That ensures that the mini-glacier 
melts slowly and provides a reliable supply of water to feed the farmers’ crops. These
methods may be ancient, but they’re becoming more relevant as climate change takes its 
toll on our planet. In fact, people are now growing their own glaciers in many regions
beyond Ladakh.

Swiss people, utilizing modern glacier growing technology, created their first stupa in
2016 in the Swiss Alps. There are plans for over 100 more in villages in Pakistan,
Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Perhaps one day we’ll be able to harness our homegrown
glaciers well enough to build whole walls of ice– this time not for keeping people out,
but to enable life in some of the planet’s harshest landscapes.
