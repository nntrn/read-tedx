I've spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation, hopefully for a good
cause, which is self-improvement. And I've done this in three parts. So first I started
with the mind. And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia
Britannica from A to Z — or, more precisely, from "a-ak" to "Zywiec." And here's a little
image of that. And this was an amazing year. It was really a fascinating journey. It was
painful at times, especially for those around me. My wife started to fine me one dollar
for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation. So it had its downsides. But after
that, I decided to work on the spirit. As I mentioned last year, I grew up with no
religion at all. I'm Jewish, but I'm Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian.

Not really. But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in
and trying to live it and immerse myself in it. So I decided to follow all the rules of
the Bible. And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard — because Leviticus says you
cannot shave. So this is what I looked like by the end. Thank you for that reaction.

I look a little like Moses, or Ted Kaczynski. I got both of them. So there was the topiary
there. And there's the sheep. Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on
the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be, the healthiest person alive. So
that's what I've been doing the last couple of years. And I just finished a couple of
months ago. And I have to say, thank God. Because living so healthily was killing me.

It was so overwhelming, because the amount of things you have to do, it's just
mind-boggling. I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of
medical advisers. And they were telling me all the things I had to do. I had to eat right,
exercise, meditate, pet dogs, because that lowers the blood pressure. I wrote the book on
a treadmill, and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book. I had to put on
sunscreen. This was no small feat, because if you listen to dermatologists, they say that
you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen. And you have to reapply it every two to
four hours. So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen. I was like a glazed
doughnut for most of the year. There was the washing of hands. I had to do that properly.
And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and
iPhones in my house, because those are just orgies of germs.

So that took a lot of time. I also tried to be the safest person I could be, because that's
a part of health. I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council. They started a public
campaign that says, "A walking helmet is a good helmet." So they believe you should not
just wear helmets for biking, but also for walking around. And you can see there they're
shopping with their helmets. 

Well yeah, I tried that. Now it's a little extreme, I admit. But if you think about this,
this is actually — the "Freakonomics" authors wrote about this — that more people die on a
per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving. So something to think about
tonight if you've had a couple. So I finished, and it was a success in a sense. All of the
markers went in the right direction. My cholesterol went down, I lost weight, my wife
stopped telling me that I looked pregnant. So that was nice. And it was successful
overall. But I also learned that I was too healthy, and that was unhealthy. I was so
focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family. And as Dan
Buettner can tell you, having a strong social network is so crucial to our health. So I
finished. And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over. I went to
the dark side, and I just indulged myself. It was like something out of
Caligula.

Without the sex part. Because I have three young kids, so that wasn't happening. But the
over-eating and over-drinking, definitely. And I finally have stabilized. So now I'm back
to adopting many — not all; I don't wear a helmet anymore — but dozens of healthy
behaviors that I adopted during my year. It was really a life-changing project. And I, of
course, don't have time to go into all of them. Let me just tell you two really
quickly. The first is — and this was surprising to me; I didn't expect this to come out —
but I live a much quieter life now. Because we live in such a noisy world. There's trains
and planes and cars and Bill O'Reilly, he's very noisy. 

And this is a real underestimated, under-appreciated health hazard — not just because it
harms our hearing, which it obviously does, but it actually initiates the fight-or-flight
response. A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going. And this, over the
years, can cause real damage, cardiovascular damage. The World Health Organization just
did a big study that they published this year. And it was done in Europe. And they
estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because
of noise pollution. So they think it's actually very deadly. And by the way, it's also
terrible for your brain. It really impairs cognition. And our Founding Fathers knew about
this. When they wrote the Constitution, they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside
the hall so that they could concentrate. So without noise reduction technology, our
country would not exist. So as a patriot, I felt it was important to — I wear all the
earplugs and the earphones, and it's really improved my life in a surprising and
unexpected way. And the second point I want to make, the final point, is that — and it's
actually been a theme of TEDMED — that joy is so important to your health, that very few
of these behaviors will stick with me unless there's some sense of pleasure and joy in
them.

And just to give you one instance of this: food. The junk food industry is really great at
pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what's the most pleasurable. But I think we
can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food. To give just one example, we love
crunchiness, mouthfeel. So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of
my recipes — throw in some sunflower seeds. And you can almost trick yourself into
thinking you're eating Doritos. 

And it has made me a healthier person. So that is it. The book about it comes out in April.
It's called "Drop Dead Healthy." And I hope that I don't get sick during the book tour.
That's my greatest hope. So thank you very much.
