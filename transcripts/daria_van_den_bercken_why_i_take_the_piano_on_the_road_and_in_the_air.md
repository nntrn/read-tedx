title: Why I take the piano on the road ... and in the air
speaker: Daria van den Bercken
description: >-
 Pianist Daria van den Bercken fell in love with the baroque keyboard music of
 George Frideric Handel. Now, she aims to ignite this passion in others. In this
 talk, she plays us through the emotional roller coaster of his music — while
 sailing with her piano through the air, driving it down the street, and of course
 playing on the stage.

Recently, I flew over a crowd of thousands of people in Brazil playing music by George
Frideric Handel. I also drove along the streets of Amsterdam, again playing music by this
same composer. Let's take a look.(Music: George Frideric Handel, "Allegro." Performed by
Daria van den Bercken.)

Daria van den Bercken: I live there on the third floor. (In Dutch) I live there on the
corner. I actually live there, around the corner. and you'd be really welcome. Man: (In
Dutch) Does that sound like fun? Child: (In Dutch) Yes![(In Dutch) "Handel house
concert"]

Daria van den Bercken: All this was a real magical experience for hundreds of reasons. Now
you may ask, why have I done these things? They're not really typical for a musician's
day-to-day life. Well, I did it because I fell in love with the music and I wanted to
share it with as many people as possible. It started a couple of years ago. I was sitting
at home on the couch with the flu and browsing the Internet a little, when I found out
that Handel had written works for the keyboard. Well, I was surprised. I did not know
this. So I downloaded the sheet music and started playing. And what happened next was that
I entered this state of pure, unprejudiced amazement. It was an experience of being
totally in awe of the music, and I had not felt that in a long time. It might be easier to
relate to this when you hear it. The first piece that I played through started like
this.

Well this sounds very melancholic, doesn't it? And I turned the page and what came next
was this.

Well, this sounds very energetic, doesn't it? So within a couple of minutes, and the piece
isn't even finished yet, I experienced two very contrasting characters: beautiful
melancholy and sheer energy. And I consider these two elements to be vital human
expressions. And the purity of the music makes you hear it very effectively. I've given a
lot of children's concerts for children of seven and eight years old, and whatever I play,
whether it's Bach, Beethoven, even Stockhausen, or some jazzy music, they are open to hear
it, really willing to listen, and they are comfortable doing so. And when classes come in
with children who are just a few years older, 11, 12, I felt that I sometimes already had
trouble in reaching them like that. The complexity of the music does become an issue, and
actually the opinions of others — parents, friends, media — they start to count. But the
young ones, they don't question their own opinion.

They are in this constant state of wonder, and I do firmly believe that we can keep
listening like these seven-year-old children, even when growing up. And that is why I have
played not only in the concert hall but also on the street, online, in the air: to feel
that state of wonder, to truly listen, and to listen without prejudice. And I would like
to invite you to do so now. (Music: George Frideric Handel, "Chaconne in G Major."
Performed by Daria van den Bercken.)

Thank you.
