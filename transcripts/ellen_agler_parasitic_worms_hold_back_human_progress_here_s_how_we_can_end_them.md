title: Parasitic worms hold back human progress. Here's how we can end them
speaker: Ellen Agler
description: >-
 Parasitic worms date back thousands of years, causing diseases that limit human
 potential. But today, effective treatment against them requires just a few pills,
 taken once or twice a year. With 1.7 billion people at risk of infection, Ellen
 Agler and her team at the END Fund are imagining a world without disease caused
 by worms. Learn about how they're seeking to lower treatment costs, amplify
 prevention, support governments and nurture local leadership. This ambitious plan
 is a part of The Audacious Project, TED's initiative to inspire and fund global
 change. (Voiced by Ama Adi-Dako)

These are worms. Not the kind of worms you find crawling in the dirt. These are parasitic
roundworms. They live inside a human being's intestines. Each of these worms can grow up
to 12 inches long, and there are 200 of them in this jar for a reason, because that is the
number you might typically find in the belly of a single infected child. Worm infections
have been around for thousands of years. They have influenced the outcomes of wars, and
they have long stymied human health. Roundworm, hookworm, whipworm, schistosomiasis:
infections from these species cause pain and discomfort. They steal nutrients and zap
energy. They stunt both physical and cognitive growth. In most cases, these worms may not
be fatal, but paradoxically, that's part of the problem. It means that many countries
simply have not been able to prioritize their treatment. There's a social cost to that:
children without access to deworming treatments have lower rates of school
attendance.

Adults who grow up without deworming medicine are less productive and have lower lifelong
earnings. What intestinal worms do, really, is limit potential. Currently, there are 1.7
billion people in the world still at risk for worms. Six hundred million of them are in
Africa. For every dollar invested in worm control and prevention, African countries see up
to 42 dollars return in economic benefits. The good news is that deworming treatment is
extremely easy. One to three pills given once or twice a year is enough to take a child
from 200 worms to zero and to protect them from infection going forward. In communities
where there's a high prevalence of worms, treatment can be done right at school. This
process is extremely simple and fast. In Ethiopia, for example, this is done for 20
million children in a matter of weeks. The world has come a long way on getting deworming
medicines to the people who need them, and African governments want to gain more
traction.

It's now time to match their ambition. The END Fund will work with governments to create a
plan that drastically reduces the burden of disease caused by worms. Theyâ€™ll work together
to ensure prevention and treatment programs can serve everyone. The END Fund has an
audacious idea: they believe we are the generation to end sickness from worm infections
forever. The key is not simply to build new programs from scratch, but to amplify the
efforts of the programs that are already taking shape. By examining the problem of how
worms transmit disease, the END Fund has identified five key areas where they can drive
improvement. Number one: lower the cost of treatment. Many pharmaceutical companies offer
deworming medicines for free, so the END Fund works with the right partners to coordinate
their delivery. They will continue to secure drug donations for additional at-risk
populations. They can now do it for less than 25 cents per child per year. Number two:
focus on prevention.

The END Fund calls in the right partners to educate communities on sanitation and hygiene
in order to change behaviors around things like hand-washing and latrine use, ensuring
people are not continually reinfected. Number three: invest in innovation. The END Fund has
contributed to deworming by introducing innovative techniques that effectively target and
treat people. They will test new delivery methods, target the environments where parasites
thrive and influence behavior change. Number four: monitor and evaluate. The END Fund
collects detailed data on all programs on a regular basis to help them get better and
better over time. Number five: increase local ownership. At all stages of the process, the
END Fund works with government and local stakeholders to encourage cofinancing commitments
that support deworming efforts. They also worked with African philanthropists and
corporate leaders to partner on these efforts. There's an incredible opportunity to work
together to create a new system for disease elimination for the next decade and
beyond.

Part of the money the END Fund needs will go directly toward delivering deworming
treatments to communities that need it and part will go towards facilitating the handover
of programs to local ownership. Together, these efforts will create prevention and
treatment programs that are sustainable far into the future. If this plan gets fully
funded for the next six years, tens of millions of people will receive deworming
treatment. With that, countries will be interrupting the cycle of disease transmission at
all levels, and most importantly, people will experience significant improvements in their
mental, physical and social health. Just imagine the potential that will be gained when
people can stop worrying about these and can put their energy into things like these.
