Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity. Discuss. Great creativity is
astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful. Great creativity can spread
tolerance, champion freedom, make education seem like a bright idea. 

Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation, or show that deprivation ain't
necessarily so. Great creativity can make politicians electable, or parties unelectable.
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce. Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans
on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips. It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road
through an impenetrable moral maze. Science is clever, but great creativity is something
less knowable, more magical. And now we need that magic. This is a time of need. Our
climate is changing quickly, too quickly. And great creativity is needed to do what it
does so well: to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements. To
tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps. Here is one such scrap from
an initiative I'm involved in using creativity to inspire people to be
greener.

Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk. Narrator: And so he walked, and
as he walked he saw things. Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen.
A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle. A father and daughter separated from a
bicycle by a mysterious wall. And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her. The
woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart. Sure, she
had aged a little. In fact, she had aged a lot. But he felt all his old passion for her
return. "Ford," he called softly. For that was her name. "Don't say another word, Gusty,"
she said, for that was his name. "I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from
here. Let's go there and make love. In the tent." Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and
then the other. Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she
filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer. The earth moved for both of
them.

And they lived together happily ever after. And all because he decided to walk that day.

Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate. The moral imperative is on the
table. Great creativity is needed to take it all, make it simple and sharp. To make it
connect. To make it make people want to act. So this is a call, a plea, to the incredibly
talented TED community. Let's get creative against climate change. And let's do it soon.
Thank you.
