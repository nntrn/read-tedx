title: Learn to read Chinese ... with ease!
speaker: ShaoLan
description: >-
 For foreigners, learning to speak Chinese is a hard task. But learning to read
 the beautiful, often complex characters of the Chinese written language may be
 less difficult. ShaoLan walks through a simple lesson in recognizing the ideas
 behind the characters and their meaning -- building from a few simple forms to
 more complex concepts. Call it Chineasy.

Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher, one of my most treasured memories
was my mother showing me the beauty, the shape and the form of Chinese characters. Ever
since then, I was fascinated by this incredible language. But to an outsider, it seems to
be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China. Over the past few years, I've been
wondering if I can break down this wall, so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate
the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so. I started thinking about how a new,
fast method of learning Chinese might be useful. Since the age of five, I started to learn
how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence. I learned new
characters every day during the course of the next 15 years. Since we only have five
minutes, it's better that we have a fast and simpler way. A Chinese scholar would
understand 20,000 characters. You only need 1,000 to understand the basic
literacy.

The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature — enough to read
road signs, restaurant menus, to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the
newspapers. Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works. You are
ready? Open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square. You get a mouth. This is a
person going for a walk. Person. If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on
both sides, as if she was yelling frantically, "Help! I'm on fire!" — This symbol actually
is originally from the shape of the flame, but I like to think that way. Whichever works
for you. This is a tree. Tree. This is a mountain. The sun. The moon. The symbol of the
door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. I call these eight characters
radicals. They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters. A person.
If someone walks behind, that is "to follow." As the old saying goes, two is company,
three is a crowd.

If a person stretched their arms wide, this person is saying, "It was this big." The
person inside the mouth, the person is trapped. He's a prisoner, just like Jonah inside
the whale. One tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have the woods. Three trees
together, we create the forest. Put a plank underneath the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the top of the tree, that's "idiot." 

Easy to remember, since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. Remember fire? Two fires
together, I get really hot. Three fires together, that's a lot of flames. Set the fire
underneath the two trees, it's burning. For us, the sun is the source of prosperity. Two
suns together, prosperous. Three together, that's sparkles. Put the sun and the moon
shining together, it's brightness. It also means tomorrow, after a day and a night. The
sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise. A door. Put a plank inside the door, it's a
door bolt. Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions. Knock knock. Is anyone home?
This person is sneaking out of a door, escaping, evading. On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they have an argument. 

Three women together, be careful, it's adultery. So we have gone through almost 30
characters. By using this method, the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32. The
next group of eight characters will build an extra 32. So with very little effort, you
will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same as a Chinese
eight-year-old. So after we know the characters, we start building phrases. For example,
the mountain and the fire together, we have fire mountain. It's a volcano. We know Japan
is the land of the rising sun. This is a sun placed with the origin, because Japan lies to
the east of China. So a sun, origin together, we build Japan. A person behind Japan, what
do we get? A Japanese person. The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of
each other. In ancient China, that means in exile, because Chinese emperors, they put
their political enemies in exile beyond mountains. Nowadays, exile has turned into getting
out.

A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit. This is a slide to remind me that I
should stop talking and get off of the stage. Thank you.
