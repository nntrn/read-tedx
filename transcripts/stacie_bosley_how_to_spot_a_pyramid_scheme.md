title: How to spot a pyramid scheme
speaker: Stacie Bosley
description: >-
 In 2004, a nutrition company offered a life-changing opportunity to earn a
 full-time income for part-time work. There were only two steps to get started:
 purchase a $500 kit and recruit two more members. By 2013, the company was making
 $200 million. There was just one problem -- the vast majority of members earned
 less than they paid in. Stacie Bosley explains what a pyramid scheme is and how
 to spot one. [Directed by Wooden Plane Productions, narrated by Bethany

In 2004, a new company called Vemma Nutrition started offering a life-changing 
opportunity to earn full time income for part time work. Vemma’s offer was open to
everybody, regardless of prior experience or education. There were only two steps to
start get started earning: purchase a $500-600 kit of their liquid nutrition products,
and recruit two more members to do the same. Vemma Nutrition Company grew quickly,
becoming a global operation that brought in 30,000 new members per month at its peak.
There was just one problem— while the company generated $200 million of annual revenue by
2013, the vast majority of participants earned less than they paid in. Vemma was
eventually charged with operating a pyramid scheme: a common type of fraud where members
make money by recruiting more people to buy in. Typically, the founder solicits an initial
group of people to buy in and promote the scheme.

They are then encouraged to recruit others and promised part of the money those people
invest, while the founder also takes a share. The pattern repeats for each group of new
participants, with money from recent arrivals funneled to those who recruited them. This
differs from a Ponzi scheme, where the founders recruit new members and secretly use their
fees to pay existing members, who think the payments come from a legitimate
investment. As a pyramid scheme grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for new recruits
to make money. That’s because the number of participants expands exponentially. Take a
structure where each person has to recruit six more to earn a profit. The founder
recruits six people to start, and each of them recruits six more. There are 36 people in
that second round of recruits, who then each recruit 6 people— a total of 216 new
recruits. By the twelfth round of recruiting, the 2.1 billion newest members would have
to recruit over 13 billion more people total to make money– more than the entire world
population.

In this scenario, the most recent recruits, over 80% of the scheme’s participants, lose
all the money they paid in. And in real life, many earlier joiners lose out too. Pyramid
schemes are illegal in most countries, but they can be difficult to detect. They are
presented as many different things, including gifting groups, investment clubs, and
multi-level marketing businesses. The distinction between pyramid schemes and legitimate
multi-level marketing can be particularly hazy. In theory, the difference is that the
members of the multi-level marketing companies primarily earn compensation from selling a
particular product or a service to retail customers, while pyramid schemes primarily
compensate members for recruitment of new sellers. In practice, though, many multi-level
marketing companies make it all but impossible for members to profit purely through
sales. And many pyramid schemes, like Vemma Nutrition, disguise themselves as legal
multi-level marketing businesses, using a product or service to hide the pay-and-recruit
structure. Many pyramid schemes also capitalize on already existing trust within churches,
immigrant communities, or other tightly knit groups.

The first few members are encouraged to report a good experience before they actually
start making a profit. Others in their network follow their example, and the schemes
balloon in size before it comes clear that most members aren’t actually profiting. Often,
the victims are embarrassed into silence. Pyramid schemes entice people with the promise
of opportunity and empowerment. So when members don’t end up making money, they can blame
themselves rather than the scheme, thinking they weren’t tenacious enough to earn the
returns promised. Some victims keep trying, investing in multiple schemes, and losing
money each time. In spite of all these factors, there are ways to spot a pyramid scheme.
Time pressure is one red flag— be wary of directives to “act now or miss a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Promises of large, life-altering amounts of income are
also suspect. And finally, a legitimate multi-level marketing business shouldn’t require
members to pay for the opportunity to sell a product or service. Pyramid schemes can be
incredibly destructive to individuals, communities, and even entire countries.

But you can fight fire with fire by sending this video to three people you know, and
encouraging them to do the same.
