title: A "self-healing" asphalt
speaker: Erik Schlangen
description: >-
 Paved roads are nice to look at, but they're easily damaged and costly to repair.
 Erik Schlangen demos a new type of porous asphalt made of simple materials with
 an astonishing feature: When cracked, it can be "healed" by induction heating.

(Microwave beeps) 

You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road. It's made of asphalt, and
asphalt is a very nice material to drive on, but not always, especially not on these days
as today, when it's raining a lot. Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt.
And especially if you then ride with your bicycle, and pass these cars, then that's not
very nice. Also, asphalt can create a lot of noise. It's a noisy material, and if we
produce roads like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, then we would like a silent
road. The solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt. Porous asphalt, a
material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands, it has pores and
water can just rain through it, so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides, and you
have a road that's easy to drive on, so no splash water anymore. Also the noise will
disappear in these pores.

Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear, so it's a very silent road. It also
has disadvantages, of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can
occur. What is raveling? You see that in this road that the stones at the surface come
off. First you get one stone, then several more, and more and more and more and more, and
then they — well, I will not do that. 

But they can damage your windshield, so you're not happy with that. And finally, this
raveling can also lead to more and more damage. Sometimes you can create potholes with
that. Ha. He's ready. Potholes, of course, that can become a problem, but we have a
solution. Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material. It's a porous
asphalt, like I said, so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones. Due to
weathering, due to U.V. light, due to oxidation, this binder, this bitumen, the glue
between the aggregates is going to shrink, and if it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks, and it
delaminates from the aggregates. Then if you drive over the road, you take out the
aggregates — what we just saw here. To solve this problem, we thought of self-healing
materials. If we can make this material self-healing, then probably we have a solution. So
what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans, and the steel wool we can cut in very
small pieces, and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen.

So then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it. Then you need a
machine, like you see here, that you can use for cooking — an induction machine. Induction
can heat, especially steel; it's very good at that. Then what you do is you heat up the
steel, you melt the bitumen, and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks, and the
stones are again fixed to the surface. Today I use a microwave because I cannot take the
big induction machine here onstage. So a microwave is a similar system. So I put the
specimen in, which I'm now going to take out to see what happened. So this is the specimen
coming out now. So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the
specimens. We tested a lot of specimens there, and then the government, they actually saw
our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that." So
they donated to us a piece of highway, 400 meters of the A58, where we had to make a test
track to test this material.

So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road, and then of course
this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know from practice.
So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab. So we did aging
on the samples, did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine, and
healed them and tested them again. Several times we can repeat that. So actually, the
conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our
healing machine — this is the big version we have made to go on the real road — if we go
on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road, which of course
saves a lot of money. Well, to conclude, I can say that we made a material using steel
fibers, the addition of steel fibers, using induction energy to really increase the
surface life of the road, double the surface life you can even do, so it will really save
a lot of money with very simple tricks. And now you're of course curious if it also
worked.

So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm. Actually, it still has to cool down
first before I can show you that the healing works. But I will do a trial. Let's see.
Yeah, it worked. Thank you.
