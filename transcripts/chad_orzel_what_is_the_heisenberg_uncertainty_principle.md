title: What is the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle?
speaker: Chad Orzel
description: >-
 The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that you can never simultaneously
 know the exact position and the exact speed of an object. Why not? Because
 everything in the universe behaves like both a particle and a wave at the same
 time. Chad Orzel navigates this complex concept of quantum physics. [Directed by
 Henrik Malmgren, narrated by Addison Anderson].

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is one of a handful of ideas from quantum physics to 
expand into general pop culture. It says that you can never simultaneously know the exact
position and the exact speed of an object and shows up as a metaphor in everything from
literary criticism to sports commentary. Uncertainty is often explained as a result of
measurement, that the act of measuring an object's position changes its speed, or vice
versa. The real origin is much deeper and more amazing. The Uncertainty Principle exists
because everything in the universe behaves like both a particle and a wave at the same
time. In quantum mechanics, the exact position and exact speed of an object have no
meaning. To understand this, we need to think about what it means to behave like a
particle or a wave. Particles, by definition, exist in a single place at any instant in
time. We can represent this by a graph showing the probability of finding the object at a
particular place, which looks like a spike, 100% at one specific position, and zero
everywhere else.

Waves, on the other hand, are disturbances spread out in space, like ripples covering the
surface of a pond. We can clearly identify features of the wave pattern as a whole, most
importantly, its wavelength, which is the distance between two neighboring peaks, or two
neighboring valleys. But we can't assign it a single position. It has a good probability
of being in lots of different places. Wavelength is essential for quantum physics because
an object's wavelength is related to its momentum, mass times velocity. A fast-moving
object has lots of momentum, which corresponds to a very short wavelength. A heavy object
has lots of momentum even if it's not moving very fast, which again means a very short
wavelength. This is why we don't notice the wave nature of everyday objects. If you toss a
baseball up in the air, its wavelength is a billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of
a meter, far too tiny to ever detect.

Small things, like atoms or electrons though, can have wavelengths big enough to measure
in physics experiments. So, if we have a pure wave, we can measure its wavelength, and
thus its momentum, but it has no position. We can know a particles position very well, but
it doesn't have a wavelength, so we don't know its momentum. To get a particle with both
position and momentum, we need to mix the two pictures to make a graph that has waves, but
only in a small area. How can we do this? By combining waves with different wavelengths,
which means giving our quantum object some possibility of having different momenta. When
we add two waves, we find that there are places where the peaks line up, making a bigger
wave, and other places where the peaks of one fill in the valleys of the other. The result
has regions where we see waves separated by regions of nothing at all. If we add a third
wave, the regions where the waves cancel out get bigger, a fourth and they get bigger
still, with the wavier regions becoming narrower.

If we keep adding waves, we can make a wave packet with a clear wavelength in one small
region. That's a quantum object with both wave and particle nature, but to accomplish
this, we had to lose certainty about both position and momentum. The positions isn't
restricted to a single point. There's a good probability of finding it within some range
of the center of the wave packet, and we made the wave packet by adding lots of waves,
which means there's some probability of finding it with the momentum corresponding to any
one of those. Both position and momentum are now uncertain, and the uncertainties are
connected. If you want to reduce the position uncertainty by making a smaller wave
packet, you need to add more waves, which means a bigger momentum uncertainty. If you want
to know the momentum better, you need a bigger wave packet, which means a bigger position
uncertainty. That's the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, first stated by German physicist
Werner Heisenberg back in 1927.

This uncertainty isn't a matter of measuring well or badly, but an inevitable result of
combining particle and wave nature. The Uncertainty Principle isn't just a practical
limit on measurment. It's a limit on what properties an object can have, built into the
fundamental structure of the universe itself.
