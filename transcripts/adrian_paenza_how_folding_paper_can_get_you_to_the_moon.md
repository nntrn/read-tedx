title: How folding paper can get you to the moon
speaker: Adrián Paenza
description: >-
 Can folding a piece of paper 45 times get you to the moon? By seeing what happens
 when folding just one piece of paper we see the unbelievable potential of
 exponential growth. This lesson will leave you wanting to grab a piece of paper
 to see how many times you can fold it! [Lesson by Adrian Paenza, directed by
 TED-Ed, narrated by Adrian Paenza].

How many times can you fold a piece of paper? Assume that one had a piece of paper that
was very fine, like the kind they typically use to print the Bible. In reality, it seems
like a piece of silk. To qualify these ideas, let's say you have a paper that's
one-thousandth of a centimeter in thickness. That is 10 to the power of minus three
centimeters, which equals .001 centimeters. Let's also assume that you have a big piece of
paper, like a page out of the newspaper. Now we begin to fold it in half. How many times
do you think it could be folded like that? And another question: If you could fold the
paper over and over, as many times as you wish, say 30 times, what would you imagine the
thickness of the paper would be then? Before you move on, I encourage you to actually
think about a possible answer to this question. OK. After we have folded the paper once,
it is now two thousandths of a centimeter in thickness.

If we fold it in half once again, the paper will become four thousandths of a centimeter.
With every fold we make, the paper doubles in thickness. And if we continue to fold it
again and again, always in half, we would confront the following situation after 10 folds.
Two to the power of 10, meaning that you multiply two by itself 10 times, is one thousand
and 24 thousandths of a centimeter, which is a little bit over one centimeter. Assume we
continue folding the paper in half. What will happen then? If we fold it 17 times, we'll
get a thickness of two to the power of 17, which is 131 centimeters, and that equals just
over four feet. If we were able to fold it 25 times, then we would get two to the power of
25, which is 33,554 centimeters, just over 1,100 feet. That would make it almost as tall
as the Empire State Building. It's worthwhile to stop here and reflect for a moment.
Folding a paper in half, even a paper as fine as that of the Bible, 25 times would give us
a paper almost a quarter of a mile.

What do we learn? This type of growth is called exponential growth, and as you see, just
by folding a paper we can go very far, but very fast too. Summarizing, if we fold a paper
25 times, the thickness is almost a quarter of a mile. 30 times, the thickness reaches 6.5
miles, which is about the average height that planes fly. 40 times, the thickness is
nearly 7,000 miles, or the average GPS satellite's orbit. 48 times, the thickness is way
over one million miles. Now, if you think that the distance between the Earth and the Moon
is less than 250,000 miles, then starting with a piece of Bible paper and folding it 45
times, we get to the Moon. And if we double it one more time, we get back to
Earth.
