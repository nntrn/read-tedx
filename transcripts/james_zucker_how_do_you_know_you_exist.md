speaker: James Zucker
description: >-
 How do you know you're real? Is existence all just a big dream? Has some mad
 scientist duped us into simply believing that we exist? James Zucker investigates
 all of these questions (and more) in this mind-boggling tribute to René
 Descartes's "Meditations on First Philosophy." [Directed by Stretch Films, Inc.,
 narrated by Addison Anderson].

How do you know you're real? It's an obvious question until you try to answer it, but
let's take it seriously. How do you really know you exist? In his "Meditations on First
Philosophy," René Descartes tried to answer that very question, demolishing all his
preconceived notions and opinions to begin again from the foundations. All his knowledge
had come from his sensory perceptions of the world. Same as you, right? You know you're
watching this video with your eyes, hearing it with your ears. Your senses show you the
world as it is. They aren't deceiving you, but sometimes they do. You might mistake a
person far away for someone else, or you're sure you're about to catch a flyball, and it
hits the ground in front of you. But come on, right here and now, you know what's right in
front of you is real. Your eyes, your hands, your body: that's you. Only crazy people
would deny that, and you know you're not crazy. Anyone who'd doubt that must be dreaming.
Oh no, what if you're dreaming?

Dreams feel real. You can believe you're swimming, flying or fighting off monsters with
your bare hands, when your real body is lying in bed. No, no, no. When you're awake, you
know you're awake. Ah! But when you aren't, you don't know you aren't, so you can't prove
you aren't dreaming. Maybe the body you perceive yourself to have isn't really there.
Maybe all of reality, even its abstract concepts, like time, shape, color and number are
false, all just deceptions concocted by an evil genius! No, seriously. Descartes asks if
you can disprove the idea that an evil genius demon has tricked you into believing reality
is real. Perhaps this diabolical deceiver has duped you. The world, your perceptions of
it, your very body. You can't disprove that they're all just made up, and how could you
exist without them? You couldn't! So, you don't. Life is but a dream, and I bet you aren't
row, row, rowing the boat merrily at all, are you?

No, you're rowing it wearily like the duped, nonexistent doof you are/aren't. Do you find
that convincing? Are you persuaded? If you aren't, good; if you are, even better, because
by being persuaded, you would prove that you're a persuaded being. You can't be nothing if
you think you're something, even if you think that something is nothing because no matter
what you think, you're a thinking thing, or as Descartes put it, "I think, therefore I
am," and so are you, really. (Airplane engine)
