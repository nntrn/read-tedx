I was thinking about my place in the universe, and about my first thought about what
infinity might mean, when I was a child. And I thought that if time could reach forwards
and backwards infinitely, doesn't that mean that every point in time is really infinitely
small, and therefore somewhat meaningless. So we don't really have a place in the
universe, as far as on a time line. But nothing else does either. Therefore every moment
really is the most important moment that's ever happened, including this moment right now.
And so therefore this music you're about to hear is maybe the most important music you'll
ever hear in your life.

Thank you. 

For those of you who I'll be fortunate enough to meet afterwards, you could please refrain
from saying, "Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life." 

Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion, for some reason. 

Somewhat like the curving of the universe. I don't know what it is. I get asked in
interviews a lot, "My god, you're guitars are so gigantic!" 

"You must get them custom made â€” special, humongous guitars."

Thank you very much.
