title: A mobile fridge for vaccines
speaker: Adam Grosser
description: >-
 Adam Grosser talks about a project to build a refrigerator that works without
 electricity -- to bring the vital tool to villages and clinics worldwide.
 Tweaking some old technology, he's come up with a system that works.

This is a work in process, based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago
about the need for the storage of vaccine.

: [On this planet 1.6 billion people don't have access to electricity refrigeration or
stored fuels this is a problem it impacts: the spread of disease the storage of food and
medicine and the quality of life. So here's the plan ... inexpensive refrigeration that
doesn't use electricity, propane, gas, kerosene or consumables time for some
thermodynamics And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator]Adam Grosser: So
29 years ago, I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration, one
of those things that stuck in my head, a lot like the Stirling engine: it was cool, but
you didn't know what to do with it. It was invented in 1858, by this guy Ferdinand Carré,
but he couldn't actually build anything with it because of the tools at the time. This
crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall, in 1928.
It was a really neat idea, and I'll get to why it didn't work, but here's how it
works.

There's two spheres and they're separated in distance. One has a working fluid, water and
ammonia, and the other is a condenser. You heat up one side, the hot side. The ammonia
evaporates and it recondenses in the other side. You let it cool to room temperature, and
then, as the ammonia reevaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot
side, it creates a powerful cooling effect. So it was a great idea that didn't work at
all. They blew up.

Because you're using ammonia, you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong; it
topped 400 psi. The ammonia was toxic, it sprayed everywhere. But it was kind of an
interesting thought. So the great thing about 2006, there's a lot of really great
computational work you can do. So we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford
involved — a lot of computational fluid dynamics. We proved that most of the ammonia
refrigeration tables are wrong. We found some nontoxic refrigerants that worked at very
low vapor pressures. We brought in a team from the UK — a lot of great refrigeration
people, it turns out, in the UK — and built a test rig, and proved that, in fact, we could
make a low-pressure, nontoxic refrigerator. So this is the way it works. You put it on a
cooking fire. Most people have cooking fires in the world, whether it's camel dung or
wood. It heats up for about 30 minutes, cools for an hour. You put it into a container and
it will refrigerate for 24 hours.

It looks like this. This is the fifth prototype, it's not quite done. It weighs about
eight pounds, and this is the way it works. You put it into a 15-liter vessel, about three
gallons, and it'll cool it down to just above freezing — three degrees above freezing —
for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment. It's really cheap. We think we can build these
in high volumes for about 25 dollars, in low volumes for about 40 dollars. And we think we
can make refrigeration something that everybody can have. Thank you.
