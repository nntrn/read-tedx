Look all around you. Whether you're in a subway, a park, an airport, a restaurant, even at
this conference, all of you have a phone in your hands or maybe in your pockets. How many
of you have a book? Very few, right? This is the sight that used to greet me every time I
walked out of my office block. I was surrounded by a sea of 20-something professionals
glued to their phones. And not a single one had a book in their hands. And this used to
make me very, very frustrated. I was a bookworm all my life. Books formed the milestones of
my life. The first man I fell in love with was Mr. Darcy. I first read "Harry Potter" when
I was 21, on a summer break from college. And I remember the first night I spent in a
little flat I bought in my mid-20s, very proudly, and I spent the whole night reading "The
Da Vinci Code." And then I'm going to make a terrible confession: even today, when I'm
low, I get into bed with "War and Peace." Don't laugh.

But I was also like all those people I saw around me: I, too, lived on my phone. I ordered
my groceries online, and soon my app knew that I needed a monthly dose of diapers. I
booked my cinemas on my phone. I booked planes on my phone. And when I did the long
commute back home like most urban Indians, and was stuck in traffic, I passed the time on
WhatsApp, video-chatting my twin. I was part of an extraordinary revolution that was
happening in India. Indians are the second-largest users of smartphones in the world. And
data prices have been slashed so radically that half of urban India and even a part of
rural India now have a smartphone with a data connection in their hands. And if you know
anything about India, you'll know that "half" means, like, all of America or something.
You know, it's large numbers.

And these numbers are just growing and growing and growing. They're exploding. And what
they're doing is empowering Indians in all kinds of extraordinary ways. And yet, none of
these changes that I was seeing around me were reflected in my world, my world of books. I
live in a country the size of Europe, and it only has 50 decent bookshops. And Indians
just didn't seem to want to read for fun. So if you look at all the best-seller lists in
India, what you'll always find in the best-seller list is exam and professional guides.
Imagine if you found the SAT guides as the "New York Times" number one seller, month after
month. And yet, the smartphone revolution was creating readers and writers of a different
kind. Whether it was on Facebook or WhatsApp, Indians were writing and sharing and reading
all kinds of things: terrible jokes, spurious pop history, long, emotional confessions,
diatribes against the government.

And as I read and shared these things, I wondered to myself, "Could I get these writers
and these readers, could I turn them into my readers?"And so I left my plush corner office
and my job as the publisher of India's top publishing company, and I set up on my own. I
moved into a single large room in a cheap bohemian district of Delhi, with a small team.
And there, I set up a new kind of publishing house. A new kind of publishing house needs a
new kind of reader and a new kind of book. And so I asked myself, "What would this new
reader want? Would they prize urgency, relevance, timeliness, directness â€” the very
qualities they seem to want from their online services, indeed, the qualities they seem to
want from life today?"I knew that my readers were always on the go. I'd have to fit into
their lifestyle and schedules. Would they actually want to read a 200-page book? Or would
they want something a little bit more digestible?

Indians are incredibly value-conscious, especially when it comes to their online reading.
I knew I had to give them books under a dollar. And so my company was formed, and it was
born. It was a platform where we created a list of stories designed for the smartphone,
but it also allowed amateur writers to upload their own stories, so they could be
showcased along with the very writers they read and admired. And we could also enter into
other people's digital platforms. So, imagine this: imagine you're a receptionist, you've
had a long day at work, you book your cab in your ride-hailing app, it shows up, and you
get into your car, and you lie back on your seat, and you put on your app. And you find a
set of stories waiting for you, timed to your journey. Imagine you're a gay young woman,
in a relatively conservative city like Lucknow, which lies near Delhi. There's no way your
parents know about your sexuality. They'd completely freak out.

Would you like lesbian love stories written in Hindi, priced under a dollar, to be read in
the privacy of your phone? And could I match readers to the events that were taking place
around them in real time? So we published biographies of very famous politicians after they
won big elections. When the supreme court decriminalized homosexuality, an LGBTQ
collection was waiting on our home page. And when India's Toni Morrison, the great writer
Mahasweta Devi died, our readers found a short story by her as soon as news hit. The idea
was to be relevant to every moment of a reader's life. Who are our readers? They're mostly
young men under the age of 30. There's someone like Salil, who lives in a city where there
isn't a modern bookshop. And he comes to our app almost every day. There's someone like
Manoj, who mostly reads us during the long commute back home. And there's someone like
Ahmed, who loves our nonfiction that he can read in a single sitting, and that's priced
very low. Imagine if you're like a young, techie boy in India's Silicon Valley city of
Bangalore.

And one day, you get an in-app notification and it says that your favorite actress has
written a sexy short story and it's waiting for you. That's how we launched Juggernaut. We
got a very famous ex-adult star, called Sunny Leone. She's India's most Googled person, as
it happens. And we got her to write us a collection of sexy short stories that we
published every night for a week. And it was a sensation. I mean, no one could believe
that we'd asked Sunny Leone to write. But she did, and she proved everyone wrong, and she
found this immense readership. And just as we've redefined what a book is and how a reader
behaves, we're rethinking who an author is. In our amateur writing platform, we have
writers that range from teenagers to housewives. And they're writing all kinds of things.
It starts as small as a poem, an essay, a single short story ... Fifty percent of them are
returning to the app to write again. Take someone like Neeraj.

He's a middle-aged executive, wife, two kids, a good job. And Neeraj loves to read. But
every time Neeraj read a book that he loved, he was also filled with regret. He wondered
to himself if he could write, too. He was convinced he had stories in his mind. But time
and real life had happened, and he couldn't really manage it. And then he heard about the
Juggernaut writer's platform. And what he loved about it was that he felt this was a place
where he could stand head and shoulders, equally, with the very writers that he most
admired. And so he began to write. And he snatched a minute here, an hour there, in between
flights in airports, late at night, when he had a little bit of time on his hands. And he
wrote this extraordinary story for us. He wrote a story about a family of assassins who
lived in the winding lanes of Old Delhi. We loved it, it was so fresh and original. And
before Neeraj knew it, he'd not only scored a film deal but also a second contract to
write another story.

Neeraj's story is one of the most read stories on our app. My journey is very, very young.
We're a two-year-old company, and we have a long way to go. But we already, and we will by
the end of this year, have about half a million stories, many priced at under a dollar.
Most of our readers love reading and trying out authors they've never, ever heard of
before. Thirty percent of our home page reads comes out of the writing that comes from our
writer's platform. By being everywhere, by being accessible and relevant, I hope to make
reading a daily habit, as easy and effortless as checking your email, as booking a ticket
online or ordering your groceries. And as for me, I've discovered that as I entered the
six-inch world of the smartphone, my own world just got very, very big. Thank
you.
