Thank you.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to perform tonight at TED New York. I've been a
dedicated TED fan and viewer, and also, I actually used to live in Manhattan when I was
younger, so New York is like a second home to me, and it's great to be back. The song I
just performed was called "my mama," and the next song I'm going to perform is another
original song of mine called "BLACK BANANA." This song I wrote about the importance of
being patient with your dreams. Because I think commitment will always be rewarded. Just
like fruit ripens when the time is right. So it's my interpretation of building the
future.(Guitar music starts)Clap your hands. One! Two! One, two, one, two, three,
four. Sitting here, killing time, I've been doing it all dayI've been always smart when it
comes to gettin' awayGot a soda pop fizzin' hard in my empty brainWhen the time is right
I'll move alright so don't get too uptightSilly girls in bathing suits cleaning cars on
SundaysThey're living a lie don't make as fool of yourself too soonLining my bananas on
the window sill to ripenWhen the time is right I'll move alright so don't get too
uptightBananananana sekasanaideBananananana-ri yuki makaseBananananana mō ato chotto dake

get some pizzaWas a brat, was running fast to get home by my curfewSilly me, tripping
quick, I was almost killed by a honkerWhen the time is right I'll move alright so don't
