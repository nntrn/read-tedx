Good afternoon. My name is Uldus. I am a photo-based artist from Russia. I started my way
around six years ago with ironic self-portraits to lay open so many stereotypes about
nationalities, genders, and social issues — ["I am Russian. I sell drugs, guns, porno with
kids!"] ["Vodka = water. I love vodka!"] 

— using photography as my tool to send a message. ["Marry me, I need a visa."]Today, I am
still performing in front of the camera and trying to be brave like Wonder Woman. I focus
on balancing meaningful message, aesthetic, beauty, composition, some irony, and
artifacts. Today, I'm going to tell you about my project, which is named Desperate
Romantics. They're my artifacts, or paintings from pre-Raphaelites Brotherhood England
mid-19th century. I took the painting and gifted new, contemporary meaning talking about
issues which are surrounding me in Russia, capturing people who are non-models but have an
interesting story. This boy is a professional dancer, only 12 years old, but at secondary
school, he hides his dancing classes and is wearing the mask of brutality, trying to be
united with the rest of his classmates like a storm trooper has no personality. But this
boy has goals and dreams but hides it to be socially accepted, because being different
isn't easy, especially in Russia. Next portrait interpretation is metaphoric.

And this is Nikita, a security guard from one of the bars in St. Petersburg. He likes to
say, "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry," quoting Hulk from the movie, but I've never
seen him angry. He hides his sensitivities and romantic side, because in Russia, among
guys, that's not cool to be romantic, but it's cool to be surrounded with women and look
like an aggressive hulk. 

Sometimes, in my project, I would take the painting and give it new meaning and new
temptation about it. Sometimes, I would compare facial features and playing with words:
irony, Iron Man, ironing man. 

Through the artifacts, I bring social issues which surround me in Russia into the
conversation. Interesting fact about marriage in Russia, that most of the 18, 19-year-old
girls are already ready, and dream to get married. We're taught from childhood, successful
marriage means successful life, so most of the girls kind of fight to get a good
husband. And what about me? I'm 27 years old. For Russian society, I'm an old maid and
hopeless to ever get married. That's why you see me in a Mexican fighter mask, in the
wedding dress, all desperate in my garden. But remember, irony is the key, and this is
actually to motivate girls to fight for goals, for dreams, and change stereotypes. Be
brave. Be ironic — it helps. Be funny and create some magic.
