For 3 billion people around the world, seafood provides a significant source of protein
and nutrition. But recent studies show that 33% of wild fisheries are overfished, while
another 60% are fished at their maximum capacity. In fact, over half the seafood we eat–
from finfish and shellfish to seaweed and algae– isn’t caught in the wild. It’s grown
through aquaculture, or aquatic farming. Farmed seafood is one of the fastest-growing
food industries, expanding in volume by 5.8% each year. But different methods of
aquaculture come with different advantages and issues– some of which echo the serious
problems we’ve seen in industrial agriculture. So how can we avoid repeating the mistakes
we’ve made on land, at sea? What aquaculture approaches are we currently using, and what
does a sustainable way to farm the ocean really look like? One of the most common
aquaculture methods involves large pens made of nets, where fish are farmed offshore in
floating cages roughly 1000 square meters in size.

Commonly employed off the coast of Chile and in the fjords of Norway, these fish, like
many industrially farmed animals, occupy stressful, overcrowded pens. They produce
massive amounts of waste, polluting the surrounding areas and potentially spreading
diseases to wild species. Worse still, since the antibiotics employed to fight disease
aren’t fully absorbed by the fish, they get excreted back into the environment. Net pens
are also susceptible to escapes, unleashing huge numbers of fish which compete for
resources and weaken the local gene pool with genes adapted for captivity. Escaped fish
can even disrupt local ecosystems as invasive species. Other techniques, such as man-made
coastal ponds commonly used for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia, create additional
environmental problems. Just like net pens, these ponds are prone to spreading pollution
and disease. Their construction also frequently destroys important ecosystems like
mangroves and marshes, which protect coastal areas from storms, provide habitats, and
absorb tons of greenhouse gases. One way to solve these problems is to farm fish on land
in completely contained systems.

Tanks and raceways can recirculate and filter water to prevent pollution. But even fully
contained facilities still contend with another major hurdle: fishmeal. About 10% of the
seafood caught globally is used to feed animals, including carnivorous farmed fish.
Researchers are working on fish feed made of insects and plant-based proteins, but for
now many inland fish farms are connected to overfishing. All these obstacles can make
sustainable aquaculture feel a long way off, but innovative farmers are finding new ways
to responsibly farm the seas. The most promising solution of all may be to look lower on
the food chain. Instead of cramming large, carnivorous fish into pens, we can work with
natural ocean systems to produce huge amounts of shellfish and seaweeds. These
low-maintenance flora and fauna don’t need to be fed at all. In fact, they naturally
improve water quality, filtering it as they feed off of sunlight and nutrients in the
seawater.

By absorbing carbon through photosynthesis, these farms help battle climate change, and
reduce local ocean acidification while creating habitats for other species to
thrive. Shifting to restorative ocean farming could provide good jobs for coastal
communities, and support healthy plant and shellfish-based diets that have an incredibly 
low carbon footprint. In just 5 months, 4,000 square meters of ocean can produce 25 tons
of seaweed and 250,000 of shellfish. With the right distribution network, a series of
small farms, collectively the size of Washington State could feed the planet. Farms like
these are already popping up around the globe, and a new generation of farmers is 
stepping up to pursue a more sustainable future. Done properly, regenerative ocean farming
could play a vital role in helping our oceans, our climate, and ourselves.
