title: Why doesn't the Leaning Tower of Pisa fall over?

 In 1990, the Italian government enlisted top engineers to stabilize Pisa's famous
 Leaning Tower. There'd been many attempts during its 800 year history, but
 computer models revealed the urgency of their situation. The tower would topple

In 1990, the Italian government enlisted top engineers to stabilize Pisa’s famous Leaning
Tower. There’d been many attempts to right the tower during its 800 year history, but this
team’s computer models revealed the urgency of their situation. They projected the tower
would topple if it reached an angle of 5.44 degrees— and it was currently leaning at 5.5.
No one knew how the tower was still standing, but the crisis was clear: they had to solve
a problem that stumped centuries of engineers, and they needed to do it fast. To
understand their situation, it’s helpful to understand why the tower tilted in the first
place. In the 12th century, the wealthy maritime republic of Pisa set about turning its
cathedral square into a magnificent landmark. Workers embellished and enlarged the
existing church, and added a massive domed baptistry to the plaza. In 1173, construction
began on a free-standing campanile, or bell tower. The engineers and architects of the 
time were masters of their craft.

But for all their engineering knowledge, they knew far less about the ground they stood
on. Pisa’s name comes from a Greek word for “marshy land," which perfectly describes the
clay, mud, and wet sand below the city’s surface. Ancient Romans counteracted similar 
conditions with massive stone pillars called piles which rest on Earth’s stable bedrock.
However, the tower’s architects believed a three-meter foundation would suffice for their
relatively short structure. Unfortunately for them, less than five years later, the
tower’s southern side was already underground. Such a shifting foundation would normally
have been a fatal flaw. If workers added more weight, the pressure from upper stories 
would sink the structure and fatally increase the lean. But construction halted at the 
fourth story for nearly a century as Pisa descended into prolonged warfare. This long
pause allowed the soil to settle, and when construction began again in 1272, the
foundation was on slightly more stable footing. Under the direction of architect Giovanni
di Simone, workers compensated for the tower’s minor tilt by making the next few floors
taller on the southern side.

But the weight of the extra masonry made that side sink even deeper. By the time they
completed the seventh floor and bell chamber, the angle of the tilt was 1.6 degrees. For
centuries, engineers tried numerous strategies to address the lean. In 1838, they dug a
walkway around the base to examine the sunken foundation. But removing the supporting
sand only worsened the tilt. In 1935, the Italian Corps of Engineers injected mortar to
strengthen the base. However, the mortar wasn’t evenly distributed throughout the
foundation, resulting in another sudden drop. All these failed attempts, along with the
ever-sinking foundation, moved the tower closer to its tipping point. And without
definitive knowledge of the soil composition, engineers couldn’t pinpoint the tower’s
fatal angle or devise a way to stop its fall. In the years following WWII, researchers
developed tests to identify those missing variables.

And in the 1970’s, engineers calculated the curved tower’s center of gravity. With this
data and new computing technology, engineers could model how stiff the soil was, the
tower’s trajectory, and the exact amount of excavation needed for the tower to remain
standing. In 1992, the team drilled diagonal tunnels to remove 38 cubic meters of soil 
from under the tower’s north end. Then, they temporarily counterbalanced the structure
with 600 tons of lead ingots before anchoring the base with steel cables. More than six
centuries after its construction, the tower was finally straightened… to a tilt of about
four degrees. No one wanted the tower to fall, but they also didn’t want to lose the 
landmark’s most famous feature. Today the tower stands at 55– or 56– meters tall, and it
should remain stable for at least 300 years as a monument to the beauty of
imperfection.
