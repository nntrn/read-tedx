title: The power of diversity within yourself
speaker: Rebeca Hwang
description: >-
 Rebeca Hwang has spent a lifetime juggling identities -- Korean heritage,
 Argentinian upbringing, education in the United States -- and for a long time she
 had difficulty finding a place in the world to call home. Yet along with these
 challenges came a pivotal realization: that a diverse background is a distinct
 advantage in today's globalized world. In this personal talk, Hwang reveals the
 endless benefits of embracing our complex identities -- and shares her hopes for
 creating a world where identities aren't used to alienate but to bring people
 together instead.

We're holding hands, staring at the door. My siblings and I were waiting for my mother to
come back from the hospital. She was there because my grandmother had cancer surgery that
day. Finally, the doors opened, and she said, "She's gone. She's gone." She started
sobbing and immediately said, "We must make arrangements. Your grandmother's dying wish
was to be buried back home in Korea."I was barely 12 years old, and when the shock wore
off, my mother's words were ringing in my ears. My grandmother wanted to be buried back
home. We had moved from Korea to Argentina six years prior, without knowing any Spanish,
or how we were going to make a living. And upon arrival, we were immigrants who had lost
everything, so we had to work really hard to rebuild our lives. So it hadn't occurred to
me that after all these years, back home was still in Korea. It made me ponder where I
would want to be buried someday, where home was for me, and the answer was not obvious.
And this really bothered me.

So this episode launched a lifelong quest for my identity. I was born in Korea — the land
of kimchi; raised in Argentina, where I ate so much steak that I'm probably 80 percent cow
by now; and I was educated in the US, where I became addicted to peanut
butter.

During my childhood, I felt very much Argentinian, but my looks betrayed me at times. I
remember on the first day of middle school, my Spanish literature teacher came into the
room. She scanned all of my classmates, and she said, "You — you have to get a tutor,
otherwise, you won't pass this class." But by then I was fluent in Spanish already, so it
felt as though I could be either Korean or Argentinian, but not both. It felt like a
zero-sum game, where I had to give up my old identity to be able to gain or earn a new
one. So when I was 18, I decided to go to Korea, hoping that finally I could find a place
to call home. But there people asked me, "Why do you speak Korean with a Spanish
accent?"

And, "You must be Japanese because of your big eyes and your foreign body language." And
so it turns out that I was too Korean to be Argentinian, but too Argentinian to be
Korean. And this was a pivotal realization to me. I had failed to find that place in the
world to call home. But how many Japanese-looking Koreans who speak with a Spanish accent
— or even more specific, Argentinian accent — do you think are out there? Perhaps this
could be an advantage. It was easy for me to stand out, which couldn't hurt in a world
that was rapidly changing, where skills could become obsolete overnight. So I stopped
looking for that 100 percent commonality with the people that I met. Instead, I realized
that oftentimes, I was the only overlap between groups of people that were usually in
conflict with each other. So with this realization in mind, I decided to embrace all of the
different versions of myself — even allow myself to reinvent myself at
times.

So for example, in high school, I have to confess I was a mega-nerd. I had no sense of
fashion — thick glasses, simple hairstyle — you can get the idea. I think, actually, I
only had friends because I shared my homework. That's the truth. But once at university, I
was able to find a new identity for myself, and the nerd became a popular girl. But it was
MIT, so I don't know if I can take too much credit for that. As they say over there, "The
odds are good, but the goods are odd."

I switched majors so many times that my advisors joked that I should get a degree in
"random studies."

I told this to my kids. And then over the years, I have gained a lot of different
identities. I started as an inventor, entrepreneur, social innovator. Then I became an
investor, a woman in tech, a teacher. And most recently, I became a mom, or as my toddler
says repeatedly, "Mom!" day and night. Even my accent was so confused — its origin was so
obscure, that my friends called it, "Rebecanese."

But reinventing yourself can be very hard. You can face a lot of resistance at times. When
I was nearly done with my PhD, I got bitten by that entrepreneurial bug. I was in Silicon
Valley, and so writing a thesis in the basement didn't seem as interesting as starting my
own company. So I went to my very traditional Korean parents, who are here today, with the
task of letting them know that I was going to drop out from my PhD program. You see, my
siblings and I are the first generation to go to university, so for a family of
immigrants, this was kind of a big deal. You can imagine how this conversation was going
to go. But fortunately, I had a secret weapon with me, which was a chart that had the
average income of all of the graduates from Stanford PhD programs, and then the average
income of all the dropouts from Stanford graduate programs.

I must tell you — this chart was definitely skewed by the founders of Google.

But my mom looked at the chart, and she said, "Oh, for you — follow your
passion."

Hi, Mom. Now, today my identity quest is no longer to find my tribe. It's more about
allowing myself to embrace all of the possible permutations of myself and cultivating
diversity within me and not just around me. My boys now are three years and five months
old today, and they were already born with three nationalities and four languages. I
should mention now that my husband is actually from Denmark — just in case I don't have
enough culture shocks in my life, I decided to marry a Danish guy. In fact, I think my
kids will be the first Vikings who will have a hard time growing a beard when they become
older.

Yeah, we'll have to work on that. But I really hope that they will find that their
multiplicity is going to open and create a lot of doors for them in their lives, and that
they can use this as a way to find commonality in a world that's increasingly global
today. I hope that instead of feeling anxious and worried that they don't fit in that one
box or that their identity will become irrelevant someday, that they can feel free to
experiment and to take control of their personal narrative and identity. I also hope that
they will use their unique combination of values and languages and cultures and skills to
help create a world where identities are no longer used to alienate what looks different,
but rather, to bring together people. And most importantly, I really hope that they find
tremendous joy in going through these uncharted territories, because I know I have. Now, as
for my grandmother, her last wish was also her last lesson to me.

It turns out that it was never about going back to Korea and being buried there. It was
about resting next to her son, who had died long before she moved to Argentina. What
mattered to her was not the ocean that divided her past and new world; it was about
finding common ground. Thank you.
