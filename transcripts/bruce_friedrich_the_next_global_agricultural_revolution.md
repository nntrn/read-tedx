title: The next global agricultural revolution
speaker: Bruce Friedrich
description: >-
 Conventional meat production causes harm to our environment and presents risks to
 global health, but people aren't going to eat less meat unless we give them
 alternatives that cost the same (or less) and that taste the same (or better). In
 an eye-opening talk, food innovator and TED Fellow Bruce Friedrich shows the
 plant- and cell-based products that could soon transform the global meat industry
 -- and your dinner plate.

In 2019, humanity received a warning: 30 of the world's leading scientists released the
results of a massive three-year study into global agriculture and declared that meat
production is destroying our planet and jeopardizing global health. One of the study's
authors explained that "humanity now poses a threat to the stability of the planet ...
[This requires] nothing less than a new global agricultural revolution."As somebody who's
spent the last two decades advocating a shift away from industrial meat production, I
wanted to believe that this clarion call was going to make a difference. The thing is,
I've seen this sort of thing again and again and again for decades. Here's 2018 from the
journal "Nature," 2017 from "Bioscience Journal," 2016 from the National Academy of
Sciences. The main point of these studies tends to be climate change. But antibiotic
resistance represents just as big of a threat. We are feeding massive doses of antibiotics
to farm animals.

These antibiotics are then mutating into superbugs that threaten to render antibiotics
obsolete within all of our lifetimes. You want a scare? Google: "the end of working
antibiotics."I'm going to get one thing out of the way: I am not here to tell anybody what
to eat. Individual action is great, but antibiotic resistance and climate change — they
require more. Besides, convincing the world to eat less meat hasn't worked. For 50 years,
environmentalists, global health experts and animal activists have been begging the public
to eat less meat. And yet, per capita meat consumption is as high as it's been in recorded
history. The average North American last year ate more than 200 pounds of meat. And I
didn't eat any.

Which means somebody out there ate 400 pounds of meat.

On our current trajectory, we're going to need to be producing 70 to 100 percent more meat
by 2050. This requires a global solution. What we need to do is we need to produce the
meat that people love, but we need to produce it in a whole new way. I've got a couple of
ideas. Idea number one: let's grow meat from plants. Instead of growing plants, feeding
them to animals, and all of that inefficiency, let's grow those plants, let's biomimic
meat with them, let's make plant-based meat. Idea number two: for actual animal meat,
let's grow it directly from cells. Instead of growing live animals, let's grow the cells
directly. It takes six weeks to grow a chicken to slaughter weight. Grow the cells
directly, you can get that same growth in six days. This is what that looks like at scale.
It's your friendly neighborhood meat brewery.

I want to make two points about this. The first one is, we believe we can do it. In recent
years, some companies have been producing meat from plants that consumers cannot
distinguish from actual animal meat, and there are now dozens of companies growing actual
animal meat directly from cells. This plant-based and cell-based meat gives consumers
everything that they love about meat — the taste, the texture and so on — but with no need
for antibiotics and with a fraction of the adverse impact on the climate. And because
these two technologies are so much more efficient, at production scale these products will
be cheaper. But one quick point about that — it's not going to be easy. These plant-based
companies have spent small fortunes on their burgers, and cell-based meat has not yet been
commercialized at all. So we're going to need all hands on deck to make these the global
meat industry. For starters, we need the present meat industry.

We don't want to disrupt the meat industry, we want to transform it. We need their
economies of scale, their global supply chain, their marketing expertise and their massive
consumer base. We also need governments. Governments spend tens of billions of dollars
every single year on research and development focused on global health and the
environment. They should be putting some of that money into optimizing and perfecting the
production of plant-based and cell-based meat. Look, tens of thousands of people died from
antibiotic-resistant superbugs in North America just last year. By 2050, that number is
going to be 10 million per year globally. And climate change represents an existential
threat to huge portions of our global family, including some of the poorest people on the
face of the planet. Climate change, antibiotic resistance — these are global emergencies.
Meat production is exacerbating these emergencies on a global scale.

But we are not going to decrease meat consumption unless we give consumers alternatives
that cost the same or less and that taste the same or better. We have the solution. Let's
make meat from plants. Let's grow it directly from cells. It's past time that we mobilize
the resources that are necessary to create the next global agricultural revolution. Thank
you.
