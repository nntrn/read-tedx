It's a common saying that elephants never forget, but these magnificent animals are more
than giant walking hard drives. The more we learn about elephants, the more it appears
that their impressive memory is only one aspect of an incredible intelligence that makes
them some of the most social, creative, and benevolent creatures on Earth. Unlike many
proverbs, the one about elephant memory is scientifically accurate. Elephants know every
member in their herd, able to recognize as many as 30 companions by sight or smell. This
is a great help when migrating or encountering other potentially hostile elephants. They
also remember and distinguish particular cues that signal danger and can recall important
locations long after their last visit. But it's the memories unrelated to survival that are
the most fascinating. Elephants remember not only their herd companions but other
creatures who have made a strong impression on them.

In one case, two circus elephants that had briefly performed together rejoiced when
crossing paths 23 years later. This recognition isn't limited to others of their species.
Elephants have also recognized humans they've bonded with after decades apart. All of this
shows that elephant memory goes beyond responses to stimuli. Looking inside their heads,
we can see why. The elephant boasts the largest brain of any land mammal, as well as an
impressive encephalization quotient. This is the size of the brain relative to what we'd
expect for an animal's body size, and the elephant's EQ is nearly as high as a
chimpanzee's. And despite the distant relation, convergent evolution has made it
remarkably similar to the human brain, with as many neurons and synapses and a highly
developed hippocampus and cerebral cortex. It is the hippocampus, strongly associated with
emotion, that aids recollection by encoding important experiences into long-term
memories.

The ability to distinguish this importance makes elephant memory a complex and adaptable
faculty beyond rote memorization. It's what allows elephants who survived a drought in
their youth to recognize its warning signs in adulthood, which is why clans with older
matriarchs have higher survival rates. Unfortunately, it's also what makes elephants one
of the few non-human animals to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. The cerebral
cortex, on the other hand, enables problem solving, which elephants display in many
creative ways. They also tackle problems cooperatively, sometimes even outwitting the
researchers and manipulating their partners. And they've grasped basic arithmetic, keeping
track of the relative amounts of fruit in two baskets after multiple changes. The rare
combination of memory and problem solving can explain some of elephants' most clever
behaviors, but it doesn't explain some of the things we're just beginning to learn about
their mental lives.

Elephants communicate using everything from body signals and vocalizations, to infrasound
rumbles that can be heard kilometers away. And their understanding of syntax suggests that
they have their own language and grammar. This sense of language may even go beyond simple
communication. Elephants create art by carefully choosing and combining different colors
and elements. They can also recognize twelve distinct tones of music and recreate
melodies. And yes, there is an elephant band. But perhaps the most amazing thing about
elephants is a capacity even more important than cleverness: their sense of empathy,
altruism, and justice. Elephants are the only non-human animals to mourn their dead,
performing burial rituals and returning to visit graves. They have shown concern for other
species, as well. One working elephant refused to set a log down into a hole where a dog
was sleeping, while elephants encountering injured humans have sometimes stood guard and
gently comforted them with their trunk.

On the other hand, elephant attacks on human villages have usually occurred right after
massive poachings or cullings, suggesting deliberate revenge. When we consider all this
evidence, along with the fact that elephants are one of the few species who can recognize
themselves in a mirror, it's hard to escape the conclusion that they are conscious,
intelligent, and emotional beings. Unfortunately, humanity's treatment of elephants does
not reflect this, as they continue to suffer from habitat destruction in Asia, ivory
poaching in Africa, and mistreatment in captivity worldwide. Given what we now know about
elephants and what they continue to teach us about animal intelligence, it is more
important than ever to ensure that what the English poet John Donne described as "nature's
great masterpiece" does not vanish from the world's canvas.
