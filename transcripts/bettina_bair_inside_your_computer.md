title: Inside your computer
speaker: Bettina Bair
description: >-
 How does a computer work? The critical components of a computer are the
 peripherals (including the mouse), the input/output subsystem (which controls
 what and how much information comes in and out), and the central processing unit
 (the brains), as well as human-written programs and memory. Bettina Bair walks us
 through the steps your computer takes with every click of the mouse. [Directed by
 Darcy Vorhees, narrated by Michelle Snow].

Do you remember when you first realized that your computer was more than just a monitor
and keyboard? That between the mouse click and the video playing, there was something that
captured your intention, understood it, and made it real? What is that something? Is it
gremlins? Let's imagine that we can shrink down to the size of an electron and inject
ourselves into a click of a mouse. If you took your mouse apart, you'd see that it's
really a very simple machine. It has a couple buttons and a system for detecting motion
and distance. You might have an optical mouse that makes these measurements with lights
and sensors, but older ones did this with a hard rubber ball and some plastic wheels. Same
concept. When you click the button on your mouse, it sends a message to the computer with
information about its position. When your mouse click is received, it's handled by the
basic input/output subsystem. This subsystem acts like the eyes and ears and mouth and
hands of the computer.

Basically, it provides a way for the computer to interact with its environment. But it
also acts like a buffer to keep the CPU from being overwhelmed by distractions. In this
case, the I/O subsystem decides that your mouse click is pretty important so it generates
an interrupt to the CPU. "Hey, CPU! Got a click here." The CPU, or central processing
unit, is the brains of the whole computer. Just like your brain doesn't take up your whole
body, the CPU doesn't take up the whole computer, but it runs the show all the same. And
the CPU's job, its whole job, is fetching instructions from memory and executing them. So,
while you're typing, typing, typing, maybe really fast, like 60 words a minute, the CPU is
fetching and executing billions of instructions a second. Yes, billions every second:
instructions to move your mouse around on the screen, to run that clock widget on your
desktop, play your internet radio, manage the files you're editing on the hard drive, and
much, much more.

Your computer's CPU is one heck of a multitasker! "But oh my gosh there's a very important
mouse click coming through now! Let's drop everything now and deal with that!" There are
programs for everything that the CPU does. A special program for the mouse, for the clock
widget, for the internet radio, and for dealing with letters sent by the keyboard. Each
program was initially written by a human in a human-readable programming language, like
Java, C++, or Python. But human programs take up a lot of space and contain a lot of
unnecessary information to a computer, so they are compiled and made smaller and stored in
bits of ones and zeros in memory. The CPU realizes that it needs instructions for how to
deal with this mouse click, so it looks up the address for the mouse program and sends a
request to the memory subsystem for instructions stored there. Each instruction in the
mouse device driver is duly fetched and executed.

And that's not nearly the end of the story! Because the CPU learns that the mouse was
clicked when the cursor was over a picture of a button on the monitor screen, and so, the
CPU asks memory for the monitor program to find out what that button is. And then the CPU
has to ask memory for the program for the button, which means that the CPU needs the
monitor program again to show the video associated with the button, and so it goes. And
let's just say there are a lot of programs involved before you even see the button on the
screen light up when you clicked it. So, just the simple task of clicking your mouse means
visiting all of the critical components of your computer's architecture: peripherals, the
basic input-output system, the CPU, programs, and memory, and not one gremlin.
