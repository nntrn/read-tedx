I will lend books to people, but of course, the rule is "Don't do that unless you never
intend to see that book again."[Small thing.][Big idea.]The physical object of a book is
almost like a person. I mean, it has a spine and it has a backbone. It has a face.
Actually, it can sort of be your friend. Books record the basic human experience like no
other medium can. Before there were books, ancient civilizations would record things by
notches on bones or rocks or what have you. The first books as we know them originated in
ancient Rome. We go by a term called the codex, where they would have two heavy pieces of
wood which become the cover, and then the pages in between would then be stitched along
one side to make something that was relatively easily transportable. They all had to
completely be done by hand, which became the work of what we know as a scribe. And
frankly, they were luxury items. And then a printer named Johannes Gutenberg, in the
mid-fifteenth century, created the means to mass-produce a book, the modern printing
press.

It wasn't until then that there was any kind of consumption of books by a large
audience. Book covers started to come into use in the early nineteenth century, and they
were called dust wrappers. They usually had advertising on them. So people would take them
off and throw them away. It wasn't until the turn of the nineteenth into the twentieth
century that book jackets could be seen as interesting design in and of themselves. Such
that I look at that and I think, "I want to read that. That interests me."The physical
book itself represents both a technological advance but also a piece of technology in and
of itself. It delivered a user interface that was unlike anything that people had before.
And you could argue that it's still the best way to deliver that to an audience. I believe
that the core purpose of a physical book is to record our existence and to leave it behind
on a shelf, in a library, in a home, for generations down the road to understand where
they came from, that people went through some of the same things that they're going
through, and it's like a dialogue that you have with the author. I think you have a much
more human relationship to a printed book than you do to one that's on a
screen.

People want the experience of holding it, of turning the page, of marking their progress
in a story. And then you have, of all things, the smell of a book. Fresh ink on paper or
the aging paper smell. You don't really get that from anything else. The book itself, you
know, can't be turned off with a switch. It's a story that you can hold in your hand and
carry around with you and that's part of what makes them so valuable, and I think will
make them valuable for the duration. A shelf of books, frankly, is made to outlast you,

no matter who you are.
