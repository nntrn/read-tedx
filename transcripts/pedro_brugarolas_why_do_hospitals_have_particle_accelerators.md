title: Why do hospitals have particle accelerators?
speaker: Pedro Brugarolas
description: >-
 Is there a way to detect diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's before they advance
 too far? Doctors are using injected radioactive drugs that circulate through the
 body and act as a beacon for PET scanners. These diagnostic tools can detect the
 spread of diseases before they can be spotted with other types of imaging. So how
 exactly does this work, and is it safe? Pedro Brugarolas investigates.

This syringe contains a radioactive form of glucose known as FDG. The doctor will soon
inject its contents into her patient’s arm, whom she’s testing for cancer using a PET
scanner. The FDG will quickly circulate through his body. If he has a tumor, cancer cells
within it will take up a significant portion of the FDG, which will act as a beacon for
the scanner. PET tracers such as FDG are among the most remarkable tools in medical
diagnostics, and their life begins in a particle accelerator, just hours earlier. The
particle accelerator in question is called a cyclotron, and it’s often housed in a bunker
 within hospitals. It uses electromagnetic fields to propel charged particles like
protons faster and faster along a spiraling path. When the protons reach their maximum
speed, they shoot out onto a target that contains a few milliliters of a type of water
with a heavy form of oxygen called oxygen-18.

When a proton slams into one of these heavier oxygen atoms, it kicks out another
subatomic particle called a neutron. This impact turns oxygen-18 into fluorine-18, a
radioactive isotope that can be detected on a PET scan. In a little under two hours,
about half the fluorine will be gone due to radioactive decay, so the clock is ticking 
to get the scan done. So how can fluorine-18 be used to detect diseases? Radiochemists at
the hospital can use a series of chemical reactions to attach the radioactive fluorine 
to different molecules, creating radiotracers. The identity of the tracer depends on what
doctors want to observe. FDG is a common one because the rate at which cells consume
glucose can signal the presence of cancer; the location of an infection; or the slowing
brain function of dementia. The FDG is now ready for the patient’s scan. When a
radiolabeled tracer enters the body, it travels through the circulatory system and gets
taken up by its target— whether that's a protein in the brain, cancer cells, or
otherwise.

Within a few minutes, a significant amount of the tracer has found its way to the target
area and the rest has cleared from circulation. Now the doctors can see their target
using a PET, or positron emission tomography, scanner. The radiation that the tracer emits 
is what makes this possible. The isotopes used in PET decay by positron emission.
Positrons are essentially electrons with positive charge. When emitted, a positron
collides with an electron from another molecule in its surroundings. This causes a tiny
nuclear reaction in which the mass of the two particles is converted into two high-energy
photons, similar to X-rays, that shoot out in opposite directions. These photons will then
impact an array of paired radiation detectors in the scanner walls. The software in the
scanner uses those detectors to estimate where inside the body the collision occurred
and create a 3D map of the tracer’s distribution.

PET scans can detect the spread of cancer before it can be spotted with other types of
imaging. They’re also revolutionizing the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease by allowing
doctors to see amyloid, the telltale protein buildup that otherwise couldn’t be confirmed
without an autopsy. Meanwhile, researchers are actively working to develop new tracers
and expand the possibilities of what PET scans can be used for. But with all this talk of
radiation and nuclear reactions inside the body, are these scans safe? Even though no
amount of ionizing radiation is completely safe, the amount of radiation the body
receives during a PET scan is actually quite low. One scan is comparable to what you’re 
exposed to over two or three years from natural radioactive sources, like radon gas; or
the amount a pilot would rack up from cosmic radiation after 20 to 30 transatlantic
flights. Most patients feel that those risks are acceptable for the chance to diagnose 
and treat their illnesses.
