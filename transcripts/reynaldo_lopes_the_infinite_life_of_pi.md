title: The infinite life of pi
speaker: Reynaldo Lopes
description: >-
 The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is always the same:
 3.14159... and on and on (literally!) forever. This irrational number, pi, has an
 infinite number of digits, so we'll never figure out its exact value no matter
 how close we seem to get. Reynaldo Lopes explains pi's vast applications to the
 study of music, financial models, and even the density of the universe. [Directed
 by Igor Coric, narrated by Addison Anderson].

Try to measure a circle. The diameter and radius are easy, they're just straight lines you
can measure with a ruler. But to get the circumference, you'd need measuring tape or a
piece of string, unless there was a better way. Now, it's obvious that a circle's
circumference would get smaller or larger along with its diameter, but the relationship
goes further than that. In fact, the ratio between the two, the circumference divided by
the diameter, will always be the same number, no matter how big or small the circle gets.
Historians aren't sure when or how this number was first discovered, but it's been known
in some form for almost 4,000 years. Estimates of it appear in the works of ancient Greek,
Babylonian, Chinese, and Indian mathematicians. And it's even believed to have been used
in building the Egyptian pyramids. Mathematicians estimated it by inscribing polygons in
circles. And by the year 1400, it had been calculated to as far as ten decimal
places.

So, when did they finally figure out the exact value instead of just estimating? Actually,
never! You see, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is what's known as
an irrational number, one that can never be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers. You
can come close, but no matter how precise the fraction is, it will always be just a tiny
bit off. So, to write it out in its decimal form, you'd have an on-going series of digits
starting with 3.14159 and continuing forever! That's why, instead of trying to write out
an infinite number of digits every time, we just refer to it using the Greek letter pi.
Nowadays, we test the speed of computers by having them calculate pi, and quantum
computers have been able to calculate it up to two quadrillion digits. People even compete
to see how many digits they can memorize and have set records for remembering over 67,000
of them. But for most scientific uses, you only need the first forty or so. And what are
these scientific uses?

Well, just about any calculations involving circles, from the volume of a can of soda to
the orbits of satellites. And it's not just circles, either. Because it's also useful in
studying curves, pi helps us understand periodic or oscillating systems like clocks,
electromagnetic waves, and even music. In statistics, pi is used in the equation to
calculate the area under a normal distribution curve, which comes in handy for figuring
out distributions of standardized test scores, financial models, or margins of error in
scientific results. As if that weren't enough, pi is used in particle physics experiments,
such as those using the Large Hadron Collider, not only due to its round shape, but more
subtly, because of the orbits in which tiny particles move. Scientists have even used pi
to prove the illusive notion that light functions as both a particle and an
electromagnetic wave, and, perhaps most impressively, to calculate the density of our
entire universe, which, by the way, still has infinitely less stuff in it than the total
number of digits in pi.
