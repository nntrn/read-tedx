 Musician and inventor Onyx Ashanti demonstrates "beatjazz" -- his music created
 with two handheld controllers, an iPhone and a mouthpiece, and played with the
 entire body. At TED's Full Spectrum Auditions, after locking in his beats and
 loops, he plays a 3-minute song that shares his vision for the future of
 music.

Text: BeatJazz. BeatJazz is: 1. Live looping, 2. Jazz improvisation And 3. "Gestural" 
sound design. Accelerometers on each hand read hand position. The color of the lights
indicates which sound I am playing. Red = Drums, Blue = Bass, Green = Chords, Orange =
Leads, Purple = PadsThe mouthpiece consists of ... a button, two guitar picks and lots
of hot glue. The heads-up display is a smartphone that displays system parameters. Why? 
To atomize music culture so that ALL past, present and future genres can be studied and
abstracted, live. And "BeatJazzers" become as common as D.J.'s. But mostly ... to MAKE
the future rather than wait for it.
