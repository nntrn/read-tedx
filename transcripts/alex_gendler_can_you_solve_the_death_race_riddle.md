title: Can you solve the death race riddle?
speaker: Alex Gendler
description: >-
 The night before the Death Race across the Wastelands is set to begin, your
 uncle, the great inventor Slate Kanoli, got kidnapped by the ruthless No-Side
 gang. The only way to get him back is to race his Coil Runner against the gang
 yourself. Win and they'll give back your uncle. Lose and you'll forfeit the Coil
 Runner and all his other creations. Can you win the race? Alex Gendler shows how.

The night before the Death Race across the Wastelands is set to begin, your uncle, the
great inventor Slate Kanoli, got kidnapped by the ruthless No-Side gang. The only way to
get him back is to race his Coil Runner against the gang yourself. Win and they’ll give
back your uncle. Lose and you’ll forfeit the Coil Runner and all his other creations. As
the grueling race gets underway, you find yourself falling further and further behind.
Your only chance is to take a shortcut your uncle told you about–– the Flux Ravine
gambit. Fortunately, the Coil Runner comes equipped with emergency turbo thrusters.
Unfortunately, your uncle was a notorious tinkerer, and the system still had some kinks 
to work out. Just minor things like the ignition exploding, the reactor leaking, or the
oxygen levels depleting— any of which would end your racing career immediately. Before
his kidnapping, Uncle Slate determined that each of these critical failures was the
ultimate result of a chain reaction originating in the thrusters.

He was also certain that while one factor could trigger two different effects, and two
factors could each independently lead to the same effect, no effect is caused by two
factors in conjunction. However, Uncle Slate never got around to pinpointing which
thruster was responsible for which error. All you have are the notes from his test
runs:1. When thrusters B and C are on, the Fuel gauge glows.2.When thrusters A, B, and D
are on, the Fuel gauge glows and the Helium tank rattles.3.When thrusters C, D, and E are
on, the Fuel gauge glows and the Gravitometer spins.4.When thrusters A, D, and E are on,
the Gravitometer spins and the Helium tank rattles.5.Shortly after the Helium tank
rattles and the Gravitometer spins, the Ignition explodes and the Oxygen levels
deplete.6.Shortly after the Fuel gauge glows and the Gravitometer spins, the Reactor
leaks. You need to use as many thrusters as possible to give yourself the best chance at
clearing the gap, without triggering any of the three catastrophic failures.

Which thrusters should you activate? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1The most important
thing to remember here is that even if we know that one thing causes another, the
converse is not necessarily true. For example, this panic switch shuts off the coil
runner’s engine. But the engine being off doesn’t necessarily mean the panic switch was
engaged— the coil runner could be out of fuel, or damaged— or turned off normally. We
can, however, conclude that if the engine is running, the panic switch hasn’t been
engaged. With that in mind, one way we can start is to work backwards from the three
defects that could knock you out of the race. So let’s look at Slate’s last two notes,
since they give direct information about those. The Gravitometer spins in both cases, 
but the results are different. That means the spinning Gravitometer can’t be the cause of
any particular malfunction. If it were, the same thing would happen each
time.

So we can conclude that a glowing Fuel gauge makes the reactor leak, while a rattling
Helium tank makes the Ignition explode and depletes the Oxygen levels. Once we know which
two errors we need to avoid, we can make a table and use the logic of cause and effect
to see which thrusters trigger them. Since the Helium tank is fine during the first test
run when thrusters B and C are active, we can assume neither makes it rattle. And from the
third run we know that D and E don’t either. That leaves thruster A, which was indeed
used in the second and fourth test runs where the Helium tank rattled. Now what causes the
glowing Fuel gauge? From the fourth test run we know it can’t be thrusters A, D, or E. So
is the culprit, B, C, or each of them separately? The answer can be found in the second
and third test runs: the fuel tank glowed in both, but B was activated in one, and C in
the other.

That means the B and C thrusters each independently make the Fuel tank glow. It looks like
the A, B, and C thrusters are off limits. Fortunately, the other two are just enough to
clear the jump. You rocket into first place and the gang begrudgingly hands over your
uncle. He thanks you profusely, and decides to celebrate your victory with a cup of tea 
from his latest contraption...
