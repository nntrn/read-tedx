Some people think that there's a TED Talk formula:"Give a talk on a round, red rug.""Share
a childhood story.""Divulge a personal secret.""End with an inspiring call to action."No.
That's not how to think of a TED Talk. In fact, if you overuse those devices, you're just
going to come across as clichéd or emotionally manipulative. But there is one thing that
all great TED Talks have in common, and I would like to share that thing with you,because
over the past 12 years, I've had a ringside seat, listening to many hundreds of amazing
TED speakers, like these. I've helped them prepare their talks for prime time, and learned
directly from them their secrets of what makes for a great talk. And even though these
speakers and their topics all seem completely different, they actually do have one key
common ingredient. And it's this: Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into
your listeners' minds an extraordinary gift — a strange and beautiful object that we call
an idea. Let me show you what I mean.

Here's Haley. She is about to give a TED Talk and frankly, she's terrified.

Presenter: Haley Van Dyck!

Over the course of 18 minutes, 1,200 people, many of whom have never seen each other
before, are finding that their brains are starting to sync with Haley's brain and with
each other. They're literally beginning to exhibit the same brain-wave patterns. And I
don't just mean they're feeling the same emotions. There's something even more startling
happening. Let's take a look inside Haley's brain for a moment. There are billions of
interconnected neurons in an impossible tangle. But look here, right here — a few million
of them are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea. And incredibly,
this exact pattern is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening.
That's right; in just a few minutes, a pattern involving millions of neurons is being
teleported into 1,200 minds, just by people listening to a voice and watching a face. But
wait — what is an idea anyway?

Well, you can think of it as a pattern of information that helps you understand and
navigate the world. Ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the complex and analytical to
the simple and aesthetic. Here are just a few examples shared from the TED stage. Sir Ken
Robinson — creativity is key to our kids' future.

Sir Ken Robinson: My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as
literacy, and we should treat it with the same status. Chris Anderson: Elora Hardy —
building from bamboo is beautiful.

Elora Hardy: It is growing all around us, it's strong, it's elegant, it's
earthquake-resistant. CA: Chimamanda Adichie — people are more than a single
identity.

Chimamanda Adichie: The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes
is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. CA: Your mind is teeming with
ideas, and not just randomly. They're carefully linked together. Collectively they form an
amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview. It's your brain's operating
system. It's how you navigate the world. And it is built up out of millions of individual
ideas. So, for example, if one little component of your worldview is the idea that kittens
are adorable, then when you see this, you'll react like this. But if another component of
your worldview is the idea that leopards are dangerous, then when you see this, you'll
react a little bit differently. So, it's pretty obvious why the ideas that make up your
worldview are crucial. You need them to be as reliable as possible — a guide, to the scary
but wonderful real world out there. Now, different people's worldviews can be dramatically
different.

For example, how does your worldview react when you see this image:

Dalia Mogahed: What do you think when you look at me? "A woman of faith," "an expert,"
maybe even "a sister"? Or "oppressed," "brainwashed," "a terrorist"?CA: Whatever your
answer, there are millions of people out there who would react very differently. So that's
why ideas really matter. If communicated properly, they're capable of changing, forever,
how someone thinks about the world, and shaping their actions both now and well into the
future. Ideas are the most powerful force shaping human culture. So if you accept that your
number one task as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience, here
are four guidelines for how you should go about that task:One, limit your talk to just one
major idea. Ideas are complex things; you need to slash back your content so that you can
focus on the single idea you're most passionate about, and give yourself a chance to
explain that one thing properly. You have to give context, share examples, make it
vivid.

So pick one idea, and make it the through-line running through your entire talk, so that
everything you say links back to it in some way. Two, give your listeners a reason to care.
Before you can start building things inside the minds of your audience, you have to get
their permission to welcome you in. And the main tool to achieve that? Curiosity. Stir
your audience's curiosity. Use intriguing, provocative questions to identify why something
doesn't make sense and needs explaining. If you can reveal a disconnection in someone's
worldview, they'll feel the need to bridge that knowledge gap. And once you've sparked
that desire, it will be so much easier to start building your idea. Three, build your idea,
piece by piece, out of concepts that your audience already understands. You use the power
of language to weave together concepts that already exist in your listeners' minds — but
not your language, their language. You start where they are.

The speakers often forget that many of the terms and concepts they live with are
completely unfamiliar to their audiences. Now, metaphors can play a crucial role in
showing how the pieces fit together, because they reveal the desired shape of the pattern,
based on an idea that the listener already understands. For example, when Jennifer Kahn
wanted to explain the incredible new biotechnology called CRISPR, she said, "It's as if,
for the first time, you had a word processor to edit DNA. CRISPR allows you to cut and
paste genetic information really easily." Now, a vivid explanation like that delivers a
satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds. It's important, therefore, to
test your talk on trusted friends, and find out which parts they get confused by. Four,
here's the final tip: Make your idea worth sharing. By that I mean, ask yourself the
question: "Who does this idea benefit?" And I need you to be honest with the
answer.

If the idea only serves you or your organization, then, I'm sorry to say, it's probably
not worth sharing. The audience will see right through you. But if you believe that the
idea has the potential to brighten up someone else's day or change someone else's
perspective for the better or inspire someone to do something differently, then you have
the core ingredient to a truly great talk, one that can be a gift to them and to all of
us.
