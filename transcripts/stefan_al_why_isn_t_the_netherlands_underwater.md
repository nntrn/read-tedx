In January of 1953, a tidal surge shook the North Sea. The titanic waves flooded the
Dutch coastline, killing almost 2,000 people. 54 years later, a similar storm threatened
the region. But this time, the Netherlands were ready. As the water swelled,
state-of-the-art computer sensors activated emergency protocols. Over the next 30
minutes, a pair of 240-meter steel arms swung shut, protecting the channel ahead. Using
680-tonne ball joints, the barrier moved in rhythm with the shifting wind and waves. By
morning, the storm had passed with minimal flooding. The first field activation of the
Maeslantkering had been a resounding success. As one of the planet’s largest mobile 
structures, this storm surge barrier is a marvel of human engineering. But the
Maeslantkering is just one part of a massive, interlocking system of water controls known
as the Delta Works— the most sophisticated flood prevention project in the world. The
Netherlands has a long history with water management.

The country lies along the delta of three major European rivers, and nearly a quarter of
its territory is below sea level. This geography makes the region extremely prone to
flooding. So much so, that some of the earliest Dutch governing bodies were informal
“water boards” that coordinated flood protection projects. But after the storms of 1953,
the Dutch government took more official measures. They established the Delta Commission,
and tasked them with protecting the entire southwestern region. Focusing on densely
populated cities, their aim was to reduce the annual odds of flooding below 1 in 10,000—
about 100 times as safe as the average coastal city. Accomplishing this lofty goal required
various infrastructure projects along the southwestern coast. The first line of defense
was to dam the region’s flood-prone estuaries. These large inlets fed many of the
country’s rivers into the North Sea, and during storms they allowed flood water to surge
inland.

Using a series of dams, the Delta Commission transformed these estuaries into expansive
lakes that serve as nature preserves and community parks. However, this solution wouldn’t
work for the Nieuwe Waterweg. As the lifeblood of the local shipping industry, this
passage had to be kept open in safe conditions, and barricaded during storm surges. In
1998, the completed Maeslantkering provided the flexible protection necessary. Alongside
additional barriers, like grassy dikes and concrete seawalls, these fortifications made
up the bulk of the Delta Works project, which was primarily focused on holding back
ocean storms. But in the following decades, the Dutch pursued additional plans to
complement the Delta Works and protect against floods further inland. Under the "Room for
the River" plan, farms and dikes were relocated away from the shore. This left more space
for water to collect in low-lying floodplains, creating reservoirs and habitats for
local wildlife.

This strategic retreat not only decreased flood risk, but allowed for the redeveloped 
settlements to be built more densely and sustainably. Perhaps no city embodies the
Netherlands' multi-pronged approach to water management as much as Rotterdam, a thriving
city almost entirely below sea level. When a storm threatens, densely populated older
districts are protected by traditional dikes. Meanwhile, newer districts have been
artificially elevated, often sporting green roofs that store rainwater. Numerous
structures around the city transform into water storage facilities, including parking
garages and plazas which normally serve as theaters and sports arenas. Meanwhile in the
harbor, floating pavilions rise with the water level. These are the first of several
planned amphibious structures, some of which house water purification systems and solar
collectors. These strategies are just some of the technologies and policies that have put
the Netherlands at the cutting edge of water management.

The country continues to find new ways to make cities more resilient to natural
disasters. And as the rising sea levels caused by climate change threaten low-lying
cities across the world, the Netherlands offers an exceptional example of how to go with
the flow.
