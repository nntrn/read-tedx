In the German town of Nördlingen in 1593, an innkeeper named Maria Höll found herself
accused of witchcraft. She was arrested for questioning, and denied the charges. She
continued to insist she wasn’t a witch through 62 rounds of torture before her accusers
finally released her. Rebekka Lemp, accused a few years earlier in the same town, faced a
worse fate. She wrote to her husband from jail worrying that she would confess under
torture, even though she was innocent. After giving a false confession, she was burned at
the stake in front of her family. Höll and Lemp were both victims of the witch hunts that
occurred in Europe and the American colonies from the late 15th century until the early
18th century. These witch hunts were not a unified initiative by a single authority, but
rather a phenomenon that occurred sporadically and followed a similar pattern each time.
The term “witch” has taken on many meanings, but in these hunts, a witch was someone who
allegedly gained magical powers by obeying Satan rather than God. This definition of
witchcraft spread through churches in Western Europe starting at the end of the 15th
century.

It really gained traction after the pope gave a friar and professor of theology named
Heinrich Kraemer permission to conduct inquisitions in search of witches in 1485. His
first, in the town of Innsbruck, didn’t gain much traction with the local authorities, who
disapproved of his harsh questioning of respectable citizens and shut down his trials.
Undeterred, he wrote a book called the "Malleus Maleficarum," or "Hammer of Witches." The
text argued for the existence of witches and suggested ruthless tactics for hunting and
prosecuting them. He singled out women as easier targets for the devil’s influence, though
men could also be witches. Kraemer’s book spurred others to write their own books and give
sermons on the dangers of witchcraft. According to these texts, witches practiced rituals
including kissing the Devil’s anus and poisoning or bewitching targets the devil singled
out for harm.

Though there was no evidence to support any of these claims, belief in witches became
widespread. A witch hunt often began with a misfortune: a failed harvest, a sick cow, or
a stillborn child. Community members blamed witchcraft, and accused each other of being
witches. Many of the accused were people on the fringes of society: the elderly, the
poor, or social outcasts, but any member of the community could be targeted, even
occasionally children. While religious authorities encouraged witch hunts, local secular
governments usually carried out the detainment and punishment of accused witches. Those
suspected of witchcraft were questioned and often tortured— and under torture, thousands
of innocent people confessed to witchcraft and implicated others in turn. Because these
witch hunts occurred sporadically over centuries and continents the specifics varied
considerably. Punishments for convicted witches ranged from small fines to burning at the
stake.

The hunt in which Höll and Lemp were accused dragged on for nine years, while others
lasted just months. They could have anywhere from a few to a few hundred victims. The
motivations of the witch hunters probably varied as well, but it seems likely that many
weren’t consciously looking for scapegoats— instead, they sincerely believed in
witchcraft, and thought they were doing good by rooting it out in their communities.
Institutions of power enabled real harm to be done on the basis of these beliefs. But there
were dissenters all along– jurists, scholars, and physicians countered books like
Kraemer’s "Hammer of Witches" with texts objecting to the cruelty of the hunts, the use
of forced confessions, and the lack of evidence of witchcraft. From the late 17th through
the mid-18th century, their arguments gained force with the rise of stronger central
governments and legal norms like due process. Witch hunting slowly declined until it 
disappeared altogether.

Both the onset and demise of these atrocities came gradually, out of seemingly ordinary
circumstances. The potential for similar situations, in which authorities use their powers
to mobilize society against a false threat, still exists today— but so does the capacity
of reasoned dissent to combat those false beliefs.
