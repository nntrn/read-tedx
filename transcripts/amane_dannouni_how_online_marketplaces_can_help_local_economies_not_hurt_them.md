title: How online marketplaces can help local economies, not hurt them
speaker: Amane Dannouni
description: >-
 The growth of online marketplaces like Uber, Airbnb and Amazon can sometimes
 threaten local businesses such as taxis, hotels and retail shops by taking away
 jobs or reducing income to the community. But it doesn't have to be this way,
 says strategy consultant Amane Dannouni. Pointing to examples like Gojek
 (Indonesia's Uber for motorbikes) and Jumia (Africa's version of Amazon), he
 explains how some online marketplaces make deliberate trade-offs to include,
 rather than replace, existing players in local economies -- benefiting everyone
 in the long run.

In February 2013, my wife and I moved to Singapore. Exactly at the same time, Uber has
announced it started operations in the country. Now, my wife and I agree on a lot of
things, but using Uber was definitely not one of them. While I was excited about the
technology and how maybe we don't need to own cars anymore, she felt that every Uber car
is here to steal jobs from taxi drivers. And Sarah was not the only one. As the Ubers,
Airbnbs and Amazons of the world — what we call "online marketplaces" — as they started
expanding their presence, we have heard, all of us, countless policymakers worried about
how to deal with these new risks of job destruction, lower wages and tax leakage. We've
also heard company leaders worried about aggressive competition from global platforms
eating up their local businesses. And on the rational level, of course I understand. After
all, this is basic supply and demand economics.

If, in any market, you dramatically increase supply, you should expect prices,
profitability and growth to go down for existing players. But in my personal experience,
I've also seen the other side of the story. Where online marketplaces, like Gojek in
Indonesia or Jumia in Africa, have helped their business ecosystems and the communities
around them. The positive side I have seen demonstrated itself in a woman, a taxi driver
in Egypt, that now had the opportunity to work without the harassment she faced in the
taxi business. It demonstrated itself through a village in Kenya that got an economic
boost, because the nearby beautiful but completely unknown lake is now becoming a national
ecotourism spot. Online marketplaces will continue to grow. And they will transform the way
we shop, the way we travel and the way we transact with each other. So we really need to
understand where is the truth between those two stories.

Should we expect more of the bright side or more of the dark and worrying side? And is
there a way to get the first without getting the second? I believe there is. As a strategy
consultant, I study businesses for a living. And as a mathematician at heart, I couldn't
live with something and its opposite being equally true. So, I went back to fundamentals,
and I asked the question: What do online marketplaces really do? What do they do? Well, at
their core, they're doing something very simple. They match sellers and buyers. That's it.
For drivers and passengers, you get Uber, Grab in Southeast Asia or DiDi in China. For
matching merchants and consumers, you get Amazon, Alibaba or Jumia in Africa. And for
housing, you get Airbnb; for fundraising, you get Kickstarter — the list goes on. What all
these examples have in common is that they transition this basic functionality of matching
sellers and buyers from the physical world to the digital world.

And by doing so, they can find better matches, do it faster and ultimately, unlock more
value for everyone. In fact, online marketplaces' core benefit is that they get us more
from the same amount of effort. For example, if you're a taxi driver in San Francisco and
you decide to work 10 hours per day, then you're actually having a paying passenger in
your car for four hours out of the 10. If you take the same car and put it on a platform
like Uber, you can have paying passengers for an additional one and a half hours. This is
the same car becoming 40 percent more productive. And the same has been proven true for
other online marketplaces. By design, they create more value for the economy. Now, we need
to figure out who gets this additional value. You can give it to the drivers — more
passengers, more income. You can give it to consumers, if you reduce prices. Or you can
decide that the platform gets to keep all of it. What usually happens is that all three of
them would somehow split it.

But what about the rest of us? We can also be impacted without being on either sides of
this business. If my neighbor decides to rent his apartment on Airbnb, and we have more
people coming in and out of the building, more noise than usual, then I'm getting an
unpleasant side effect of this productivity magic. This is what economists would call a
"negative externality." The negative externality of Uber cars becoming more productive is
taxi drivers seeing the value of their licenses drop by as much as 30 percent in New York,
for example. This is the dark side. And this is what sparks street demonstrations and
sometimes, sometimes, even violence. I profoundly believe this is avoidable. And it became
clearer to me the more I have spent time in emerging markets. In fact, during my time in
Singapore, I spent half of any given week traveling in the region, between Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia, and I became a user — actually, more of a fan — of online
marketplaces that were not that well-known back then. But some of them made interesting
strategic trade-offs that dramatically reduced their side effects, their
externalities.

Take Gojek, for example. They're basically Uber for motor bikes. They are one of the most
liked online marketplaces in Indonesia, and this has a lot to do with the role they chose
to play. Instead of picking a fight with every other transportation option out there, they
choose to gradually integrate them within their own platform, so that without leaving the
Gojek app, you can check the public transportation schedule and choose to take a bus for a
long distance. Then, maybe, a motorbike or a traditional taxi that you can order and pay
for from within the same app. If you look at Gojek today, nine out of 10 previous motor
taxi drivers believe their quality of life has improved after joining the platform. And
nine out of 10 consumers — nine out of 10 — believe that Gojek has a positive impact on
society in general. Now, this level of trust is what allowed Gojek to grow into what is
today a super online marketplace for everything from food to grocery even massages and
laundry pickups.

It all came from a deliberate trade-off to be an orchestrator of a bigger ecosystem where
others also have their role to play, instead of a single winner, a hero, that takes for
himself what would, at the end, be a smaller pie. Another interesting example is Jumia.
Jumia is the equivalent of Amazon in Africa. But they don't generate the same level of
fear in the small-business community. And one of the reasons for that is because they have
decided to actively invest in African entrepreneurs, to grow them into the digital age.
Now keep in mind, Jumia is operating in countries with some of the lowest digital literacy
and digital connectivity scores in the world. Now they could have dealt with that the
usual way, through lobbying for reforms — and they probably do that — but they have also
built Jumia University, an e-learning platform where merchants can come and learn basic
digital and business skills. We have studied online marketplaces in Africa last
year.

And during that study, we have met one of Jumia's merchants. His name is Jomo. He was
fired from his job in 2014, and at that time, he decided he wanted to become his own boss.
He wanted to be independent. He also wanted to never be fired again. So at that time, Jomo
had no clue what a business is. So he needed to go through a series of trainings to learn
how to select products, how to price them and how to promote them online. Today, Jomo has
a 10-employee online business. And as of a few months ago, he just opened his very first
brick-and-mortar shop in the suburbs of Nairobi. Now, through its university, Jumia has
the potential of helping a huge number of Jomos. And we have estimated that together with
other online marketplaces on the continent, they can generate three million additional
jobs by 2025. And they would do that either directly, or through their impact on the wider
community. And sometimes, taking that wider impact into consideration or forgetting about
it can make or break a platform.

To illustrate that, let's go back to Singapore. So, when we decided with my wife to leave
the country last year, Uber decided to do the same. At the same time, again, we started to
see that pattern, but maybe it's a coincidence. In reality, Uber lost the ride-hailing
battle to a Malaysian-born start-up called Grab. Now, interestingly, my wife didn't have
the same level of concerns with Grab, because when Grab started, it had a different name.
It was called MyTeksi, and as the name suggests, it started as a platform for taxis. So
when Grab started expanding the driver pool beyond taxis, it was seen as gradual and
reasonable. They were also very careful while doing so. They thought of what kind of
social safety net they should bring to all drivers. So they put in place special insurance
packages and even financial education programs. Now, compare that with what happened in
London, in New York, in Paris, where taxi drivers didn't feel that the platforms
understood they had to pay 200,000 euros for their license — and mostly in
loans.

When you don't take that kind of social environmental information into account, you get
strong reactions. I'm not trying to argue that the trade-offs by either Grab or Jumia or
Gojek are risk-free. Did they slow down growth at some point, temporarily? Maybe. But look
at them today. Gojek is worth 10 billion dollars. Jumia is one of only three unicorns in
the whole of Africa. And Grab, well, they pushed out Uber out of the whole region of
Southeast Asia. And I also think these trade-offs have nothing specific to emerging
markets. Amazon or Uber or others can learn from them and adapt them to their own
realities. In the long run, this doesn't need to be a zero-sum game. In the long run — and
this is maybe the Asian side of me speaking — it pays to be patient. It pays to reconsider
your goal and your priorities in the light of a much bigger equation that includes you and
your users, of course, but also it includes regulators, policymakers, your
communities.

And I would argue, above all, it includes the very businesses you are meant to
disrupt. Thank you.
