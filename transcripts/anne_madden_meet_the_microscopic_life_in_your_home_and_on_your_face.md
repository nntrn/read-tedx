title: Meet the microscopic life in your home -- and on your face
speaker: Anne Madden
description: >-
 Behold the microscopic jungle in and around you: tiny organisms living on your
 cheeks, under your sofa and in the soil in your backyard. We have an adversarial
 relationship with these microbes -- we sanitize, exterminate and disinfect them
 -- but according to microbiologist Anne Madden, they're sources of new technologies
 and medicines waiting to be discovered. These microscopic alchemists aren't
 gross, Madden says -- they're the future.

I want you to touch your face. Go on. What do you feel? Soft? Squishy? It's you, right?
You're feeling you? Well, it's not quite true. You're actually feeling thousands of
microscopic creatures that live on our face and fingers. You're feeling some of the fungi
that drifted down from the air ducts today. They set off our allergies and smell of
mildew. You're feeling some of the 100 billion bacterial cells that live on our skin.
They've been munching away at your skin oils and replicating, producing the smells of body
odor. You're likely even touching the fecal bacteria that sprayed onto you the last time
you flushed a toilet, or those bacteria that live in our water pipes and sprayed onto you
with your last shower. Sorry.

You're probably even giving a microscopic high five to the two species of mites that live
on our faces, on all of our faces. They've spent the night squirming across your face and
having sex on the bridge of your nose.

Many of them are now leaking their gut contents onto your pores.

Now look at your finger. How's it feel? Gross? In desperate need of soap or bleach? That's
how you feel now, but it's not going to be how you feel in the future. For the last 100
years, we've had an adversarial relationship with the microscopic life nearest us. If I
told you there was a bug in your house or bacteria in your sink, there was a human-devised
solution for that, a product to eradicate, exterminate, disinfect. We strive to remove
most of the microscopic life in our world now. But in doing so, we're ignoring the best
source of new technology on this planet. The last 100 years have featured human solutions
to microbial problems, but the next 100 years will feature microbial solutions to human
problems. I'm a scientist, and I work with researchers at North Carolina State University
and the University of Colorado to uncover the microscopic life that is nearest us, and
that's often in our most intimate and boring environments, be it under our couches, in our
backyards, or in our belly buttons.

I do this work because it turns out that we know very little about the microscopic life
that's nearest us. As of a few years ago, no scientist could tell you what bugs or
microorganisms live in your home â€” your home, the place you know better than anywhere
else. And so I and teams of others are armed with Q-tips and tweezers and advanced DNA
techniques to uncover the microscopic life nearest us. In doing so, we found over 600
species of bugs that live in USA homes, everything from spiders and cockroaches to tiny
mites that cling to feathers. And we found over 100,000 species of bacteria and fungi that
live in our dust bunnies, thousands more that live on our clothes or in our showers. We've
gone further still, and we looked at the microorganisms that live inside the bodies of
each of those bugs in our home. In each bug, for example, a wasp, we see a microscopic
jungle unfold in a petri plate, a world of hundreds of vibrant species.

Behold the biological cosmos! So many of the species you're looking at right now don't yet
have names. Most of the life around us remains unknown. I remember the first time I
discovered and got to name a new species. It was a fungus that lives in the nest of a
paper wasp. It's white and fluffy, and I named it "mucor nidicola," meaning in Latin that
it lives in the nest of another. This is a picture of it growing on a dinosaur, because
everyone thinks dinosaurs are cool. At the time, I was in graduate school, and I was so
excited that I had found this new life form. I called up my dad, and I go, "Dad! I just
discovered a new microorganism species." And he laughed and he goes, "That's great. I hope
you also discovered a cure for it."

"Cure it."Now, my dad is my biggest fan, so in that crushing moment where he wanted to
kill my new little life form, I realized that actually I had failed him, both as a
daughter and a scientist. In my years toiling away in labs and in people's backyards,
investigating and cataloging the microscopic life around us, I'd never made clear my true
mission to him. My goal is not to find technology to kill the new microscopic life around
us. My goal is to find new technology from this life, that will help save us. The diversity
of life in our homes is more than a list of 100,000 new species. It is 100,000 new sources
of solutions to human problems. I know it's hard to believe that anything that's so small
or only has one cell can do anything powerful, but they can. These creatures are
microscopic alchemists, with the ability to transform their environment with an arsenal of
chemical tools. This means that they can live anywhere on this planet, and they can eat
whatever food is around them.

This means they can eat everything from toxic waste to plastic, and they can produce waste
products like oil and battery power and even tiny nuggets of real gold. They can transform
the inedible into nutritive. They can make sugar into alcohol. They give chocolate its
flavor, and soil the power to grow. I'm here to tell you that the next 100 years will
feature these microscopic creatures solving more of our problems. And we have a lot of
problems to choose from. We've got the mundane: bad-smelling clothes or bland food. And
we've got the monumental: disease, pollution, war. And so this is my mission: to not just
catalog the microscopic life around us, but to find out what it's uniquely well-suited to
help us with. Here's an example. We started with a pest, a wasp that lives on many of our
homes. Inside that wasp, we plucked out a little-known microorganism species with a unique
ability: it could make beer. This is a trait that only a few species on this planet
have.

In fact, all commercially produced beer you've ever had likely came from one of only three
microorganism species. Yet our species, it could make a beer that tasted like honey, and
it could also make a delightfully tart beer. In fact, this microorganism species that
lives in the belly of a wasp, it could make a valuable sour beer better than any other
species on this planet. There are now four species that produce commercial beer. Where you
used to see a pest, now think of tasting your future favorite beer. As a second example, I
worked with researchers to dig in the dirt in people's backyards. There, we uncovered a
microorganism that could make novel antibiotics, antibiotics that can kill the world's
worst superbugs. This was an awesome thing to find, but here's the secret: for the last 60
years, most of the antibiotics on the market have come from similar soil bacteria. Every
day, you and I and everyone in this room and on this planet, are saved by similar soil
bacteria that produce most of our antibiotics.

Where you used to see dirt, now think of medication. Perhaps my favorite example comes from
colleagues who are studying a pond scum microorganism, which is tragically named after the
cow dung it was first found in. It's pretty unremarkable and would be unworthy of
discussion, except that the researchers found that if you feed it to mice, it vaccinates
against PTSD. It vaccinates against fear. Where you used to see pond scum, now think of
hope. There are so many more microbial examples that I don't have time to talk about today.
I gave you examples of solutions that came from just three species, but imagine what those
other 100,000 species in your dust bunnies might be able to do. In the future, they might
be able to make you sexier or smarter or perhaps live longer. So I want you to look at your
finger again. Think about all those microscopic creatures that are unknown. Think about in
the future what they might be able to do or make or whose life they might be able to
save.

How does your finger feel right now? A little bit powerful? That's because you're feeling
the future. Thank you.
