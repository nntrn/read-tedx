"The New Colossus" by Emma Lazarus Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With
conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall
stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. “Keep, ancient lands, your storied
pomp!” cries she With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses
yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the
homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
