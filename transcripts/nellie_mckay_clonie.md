But anyway, this is about the evils of science, so I think it’s perfect.♫ My oh my,
walking by, who’s the apple of my eye? ♫♫ Why, it's my very own Clonie. ♫♫ Oh, if I should
stroll the hood, who knew I could look so good ♫♫ just talking on the phone to Clonie. ♫♫
We are pals, it's cool, 'cause we're not lonely, ♫♫ shallow gene pool is nothing to my
only Clonie. ♫♫ Me and you, hustling through, holding on through thick and thin, ♫♫ just
day by day, our DNA, so the Olson twins got nothing on us. ♫♫ We'll survive, side by side.
Mother Nature, don’t you call her phony, she’s my Clonie. ♫♫ Was wealthy, but not healthy,
had no one to dwell with me, ♫♫ so look who I got born — Clonie. ♫♫ Far from broke, bored,
rich folk, we don't need no natural yolk — ♫♫ our babies come full-formed, Clonie. ♫♫
We'll be huggable, get a publicist ♫♫ and show them, be the most lovable thing since
fucking Eminem. ♫♫ Oh my friend, multiply, we’re a franchise, like Walt Disney or Hannibal
Lecter.

♫♫ We can tell our cancer cells are more benign than old Phil Spector. ♫♫ We’ll survive
side by side, should have signed with Verve instead of Sony. ♫♫ You’re my Clonie. ♫ "Oh
Clonie, how I love you.""Ha, I'm the only person I ever loved."♫ Gee, that's swell. I
guess you're just my fatal attraction-ie. You’re my Clonie. ♫Thank you.
