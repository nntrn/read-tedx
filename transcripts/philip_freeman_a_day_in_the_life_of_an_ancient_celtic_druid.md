As the sun rises on a fall morning in 55 BCE, Camma lays two pigeons on the altar at the
center of her village. She offers a prayer to Matrona mother goddess of the Earth, and
Lugus chief of the gods. Then, she wrings the birds’ necks and cuts them open to examine
their entrails for divine messages. Camma is a druid. This means she conducts religious
rites, but she also serves as a judge, healer, and scholar, teaching children and
mediating conflict between Celtic tribes. She began her studies as a child, memorizing
the countless details necessary to perform her many roles, since the druids’ knowledge is
considered too sacred to record in writing. Like many druids, she spent years studying in
Britain. Now, she is a resident Druid of the Veneti tribe in a small farming village near
the western coast of Gaul, in what is now France. Since returning to Gaul, she has
received many offers of marriage– but she has decided to devote herself to her work, at
least for now. This morning, the omens are troubling.

They tell of war and strife, as they often have in recent months. A neighboring tribe, the
Redones, have raided their village and stolen cattle in broad daylight twice this
fall. The children have gathered around to watch her work. Camma plays her lyre and sings
to them. She weaves stories of the powerful kings who once ruled their land – brave
warriors who were slain naked in combat but who will be reborn, as will all the
Celts. When the children go off to help in the fields, Camma heads across the village to
visit an old woman with an eye infection. On the way to the old woman’s hut, she passes
men salting pigs for the winter food supply and women weaving clothing from dyed wool.
She delivers a remedy for the injured eye– it’s made from mistletoe, a sacred healing
plant, but deadly if used incorrectly. From there, Camma visits the chieftain to discuss
the omens. She convinces him to go and talk through their problems with their
neighbors.

Accompanied by several warriors, they head through the forest and demand a meeting
outside the Redones’ village walls. The Redones’ representatives bring their own druid,
who Camma recognizes from the annual gathering in central Gaul where head druids are
elected. The chieftains immediately begin to argue and threaten each other. Camma steps
between the opposing sides to stop them from fighting— they must honor her authority.
Finally, the Redones agree to pay Camma’s tribe several cattle. In spite of this
resolution, Camma still feels uneasy on the long walk home. As they approach the village
walls, a bright streak shoots across the sky— another omen, but of what? Back home, Camma
sits among the elders for her evening meal of porridge, a bit of meat, and a cup of wine.
While they were out during the day, an intercepted parchment arrived. Camma recognizes
the writing immediately. Although the druids are forbidden from recording their
knowledge, she and many other young druids can read Latin.

From the message, she learns that the Romans are drawing closer to their lands. Some of
the elders say that the tribe should flee to the nearby hills and hide, but Camma
counsels them to trust in the gods and remain in their home. Privately, she has her
doubts. Should the Romans reach them, her power to help might be limited. Unlike the
other Celtic tribes, Roman legions have no regard for the druids’ sacred role as
peacemakers. Before going to bed, she observes the course of the planets and consults her
charts, trying to make sense of the meteor she saw earlier. The signs are converging on a
larger threat than their neighbors.
