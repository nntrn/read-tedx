“All the World’s a Stage” from "As You Like It" by William Shakespeare All the world’s a
stage, And all the men and women merely players; They have their exits and their
entrances; And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages. At first
the infant, Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms; And then the whining school-boy, with
his satchel And shining morning face, creeping like snail Unwillingly to school. And then
the lover, Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then
a soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard, Jealous in honour, sudden
and quick in quarrel, Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then
the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lin’d, With eyes severe and beard of
formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances; And so he plays his part. The sixth
age shifts Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon, With spectacles on nose and pouch on
side; His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide For his shrunk shank; and his big
manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble, pipes And whistles in his
sound.

Last scene of all, That ends this strange eventful history, Is second childishness and
mere oblivion; Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
