(Music: "East Virginia")

I'm from old East Virginia. North CarolinaI did go. I met a fair, young maiden. Her name I
did not know.

Don't that road look rough and rocky? Don't that sea look wide and deep? Don't my darlin'
look the sweetest ...When she's in my arms asleep?

Her hair was a dark-brown curly. Her cheeks were chestnut red. On her breast she wore a
white lilly. Through the night, the tears she shed.

Captain, Captain, I am dyin'.Won't you take these words for me? Take them back to old East
Virginia. Tell my darlin' she is free.

(Music ends)(Applause and cheers)That was a song called "East Virginia" I learned from a
man named Clifton Hicks who lives down in Georgia. The next song ... I have for you is
called "John Brown's Dream." It's an old dance tune. And you may notice that the banjo
that I'm holding looks a little different than banjos you might be used to seeing or the
one I just played, for example. And this banjo is sort of an earlier model. Banjos kind of
evolved like a human has. And I like to say that the sound that comes out of this banjo is
a sound that was just a little closer to the source, which is Africa, and some people
forget that, so, yeah ...(Banjo tuning)(Music: "John Brown's Dream")

(Banjo continues)

John Brown's dream,John Brown's dream the devil was dead. I'm gonna get that, get that, get
that,I'm gonna get that pretty little girl.

John Brown's dream,John Brown's dream the devil was dead.

Come on, Liza, Liza, Liza. Come on, Liza we'll be pickin' it again. I'm gonna get that, get
that, get that,I'm gonna get that pretty little girl.

(Music ends)(Applause and cheers)Thank you very much.
