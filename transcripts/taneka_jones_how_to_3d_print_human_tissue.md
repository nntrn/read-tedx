There are currently hundreds of thousands of people on transplant lists, waiting for
critical organs like kidneys, hearts, and livers that could save their lives.
Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs available to fill that demand. What
if instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s
the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine currently under
development. We’re not able to print complex organs just yet, but simpler tissues
including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange are already
in our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3-D printing, a technique that
deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object 
one slice at a time. Instead of starting with metal, plastic, or ceramic, a 3-D printer
for organs and tissues uses bioink: a printable material that contains living cells. The
bulk of many bioinks are water-rich molecules called hydrogels.

Mixed into those are millions of living cells as well as various chemicals that 
encourage cells to communicate and grow. Some bioinks include a single type of cell,
while others combine several different kinds to produce more complex structures. Let’s say
you want to print a meniscus, which is a piece of cartilage in the knee that keeps the
shinbone and thighbone from grinding against each other. It’s made up of cells called
chondrocytes, and you’ll need a healthy supply of them for your bioink. These cells can
come from donors whose cell lines are replicated in a lab. Or they might originate from a 
patient’s own tissue to create a personalized meniscus less likely to be rejected by their
body. There are several printing techniques, and the most popular is extrusion-based 
bioprinting. In this, bioink gets loaded into a printing chamber and pushed through a
round nozzle attached to a printhead.

It emerges from a nozzle that’s rarely wider than 400 microns in diameter, and can
produce a continuous filament roughly the thickness of a human fingernail. A computerized
image or file guides the placement of the strands, either onto a flat surface or into a 
liquid bath that’ll help hold the structure in place until it stabilizes. These printers
are fast, producing the meniscus in about half an hour, one thin strand at a time. After
printing, some bioinks will stiffen immediately; others need UV light or an additional 
chemical or physical process to stabilize the structure. If the printing process is
successful, the cells in the synthetic tissue will begin to behave the same way cells do
in real tissue: signaling to each other, exchanging nutrients, and multiplying. We can
already print relatively simple structures like this meniscus. Bioprinted bladders have
also been successfully implanted, and printed tissue has promoted facial nerve
regeneration in rats.

Researchers have created lung tissue, skin, and cartilage, as well as miniature,
semi-functional versions of kidneys, livers, and hearts. However, replicating the complex
 biochemical environment of a major organ is a steep challenge. Extrusion-based
bioprinting may destroy a significant percentage of cells in the ink if the nozzle is too
small, or if the printing pressure is too high. One of the most formidable challenges is
how to supply oxygen and nutrients to all the cells in a full-size organ. That’s why the
greatest successes so far have been with structures that are flat or hollow— and why
researchers are busy developing ways to incorporate blood vessels into bioprinted
tissue. There’s tremendous potential to use bioprinting to save lives and advance our 
understanding of how our organs function in the first place. And the technology opens up
a dizzying array of possibilities, such as printing tissues with embedded
electronics.

Could we one day engineer organs that exceed current human capability, or give ourselves
features like unburnable skin? How long might we extend human life by printing and
replacing our organs? And exactly who—and what— will have access to this technology and
its incredible output?
