 It isn't easy holding complex sentences together (just ask a conjunction or a
 subordinate), but the clever little comma can help lighten the load. But how to
 tell when help is really needed? Terisa Folaron offers some tricks of the comma

Commas are tricky things, especially when subordinates and conjunctions are involved. If
you can remember a few basic rules, a simple law of physics, and some common scenarios,
you will be able to use commas correctly. I like to think of the different parts of our
sentence as characters. Let's meet a few of them: the tiny conjunctions, the mighty
subordinates, and the clever comma. Conjunctions are small and nimble. They are words that
connect clauses, words, and phrases. You can easily remember the conjunctions by
remembering the acronym FANBOYS. The conjunctions are for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so.
Because they're so small, more often than not, they require the help of a comma but not
always. Subordinates, on the other hand, are the WWE heavyweight champions of sentences.
They are words that connect two unequal things, dependent and independent clauses.
Subordinates make it very clear what is being prioritized in a sentence.

Commonly used subordinates are although, because, before, however, unless, and even
though. Because subordinates are all about power, they can do a lot of heavy lifting by
themselves. But, of course, sometimes even the strongest among us needs some help from our
clever friends. Because our clever comma is so nice, she often roams her neighborhood
looking for some community service to do. Today, as soon as she leaves her house, she sees
a subordinate lifting the weight of two complete sentences, one on each arm. Bartheleme
loves engaging in political debate even though he usually loses. The comma asks the
subordinate if he needs help. Well, we know that subordinates are the WWE heavyweight
champions of sentences. They can easily hold the weight of these two complete sentences
because they are distributed evenly on both arms. So, when the comma asks if it can help,
the subordinate is appalled at the idea of needing assistance. No thanks, maybe next time!
So, the comma continues on.

Soon, she seems a couple of subordinates attempting to lift the weight of sentences
directly in front of themselves. Even though Bartheleme loves to sing, he never sings in
front of others. The comma asks the subordinates if they need help. They might not want to
admit it, but this time the subordinates do need help. Complete sentences weigh quite a
bit. Simple physics tells us that it's easier to balance heavy objects if the weight is
evenly distributed. So, while the subordinates are quite capable of balancing two complete
sentences when carrying the weight on both sides, they're having trouble picking just one
up. The comma rushes over to help the struggling subordinates, but how will she help? When
subordinates begin sentences, the comma will place herself directly after the first
thought or complete sentence. After helping the subordinates, our comma heroine continues
on and spots a conjunction holding the weight of two complete sentences.

Bartheleme was accepted into the University of Chicago, and he is on the waitlist for
Stanford University. The comma asks the conjunction if he needs help. Of course he does!
Hurry! The comma rushes and places itself before the conjunction. Fanboys aren't as
militant as subordinates. For this reason, the commas don't have to fall in line behind
the fanboys. Fanboys are courteous creatures. They allow the comma to go ahead of them.
Helping others is hard work! On her way home, our comma sees a conjunction holding up the
weight of a complete sentence and a fragment sentence. Bartheleme is going to major in
molecular biology or interpretive dance. The now-exhausted comma asks the conjunction if
he needs help lifting the items. This is one of the rare occassions where a conjunction
doesn't need the help of a comma. The conjunction assures the comma that help isn't
needed, which is good for the comma because by now, all it wants to do is go home and rest
up for another day of vigilant sentence constructing.
