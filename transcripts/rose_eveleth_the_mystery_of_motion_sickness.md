title: The mystery of motion sickness
speaker: Rose Eveleth
description: >-
 Although one third of the population suffers from motion sickness, scientists
 aren't exactly sure what causes it. Like the common cold, it's a seemingly simple
 problem that's still without a cure. And if you think it's bad on a long family
 car ride, imagine being a motion sick astronaut! Rose Eveleth explains what's
 happening in our bodies when we get the car sick blues. [Directed by Tom Gran,
 narrated by Rose Eveleth].

Can you read in the car? If so, consider yourself pretty lucky. For one-third of the
population, looking at a book while moving along in a car or a boat or train or plane
quickly makes them sick to their stomach. But why do we get motion sickness in the first
place? Well, believe it or not, scientists aren't exactly sure. The most common theory has
to do with mismatched sensory signals. When you travel in a car, your body gets two
different messages. Your eyes are seeing the inside of a vehicle, which doesn't seem to be
moving. Meanwhile, your ear is telling your brain you're accelerating. Wait, your ear?
Your ear has another important function besides hearing. In its innermost part lies a
group of structures known as the vestibular system, which gives us our sense of balance
and movement. Inside there are three semicircular tubules that can sense rotation, one for
each dimension of space. And there are also two hair-lined sacks filled with
fluid.

When you move, the fluid shifts and tickles the hairs, telling your brain if you're moving
horizontally or vertically. All this tells your body which direction you're moving in, how
much you've accelerated, even at what angle. In a car, your vestibular system correctly
senses your movement, but your eyes don't see it, especially when glued to a book. The
opposite can happen. You're at the movies, and the camera makes a sweeping move. This
time, your eyes think you're moving while your ear knows you're sitting still. But why
does this conflicting information make us feel so terrible? Scientists aren't sure, but
they think there's an evolutionary explanation. Fast moving vehicles and video recordings
have only existed in the last couple of centuries, a blink in evolutionary time. For most
of our history, there wasn't that much that could cause this sensory mix-up, except for
poisons. And because poisons are not the best thing for survival, our bodies evolved a
direct but unpleasant way to get rid of what we ate that was causing the
confusion.

It's a pretty reasonable theory, but it leaves things unexplained, like why women are more
affected by motion sickness than men, or why passengers get more nauseous than drivers.
Another theory suggests that the cause is more about the way some unfamiliar situations
make it harder to maintain our natural body posture. Studies show that being immersed in
water or just changing your stance can greatly reduce the effects of motion sickness. But
we don't really know what's going on. We know the more common remedies for car queasiness
â€” looking at the horizon, over-the-counter pills, chewing gum, but none are totally
reliable nor can they handle intense motion sickness and sometimes the stakes are far
higher than just not being bored during a long car ride. At NASA, where astronauts are
hurled into space at 17,000 miles per hour, motion sickness is a serious problem. In
addition to researching the latest space-age technologies, NASA also spends a lot of time
figuring out how to keep astronauts from vomiting up their space rations.

Like understanding the mysteries of sleep or curing the common cold, motion sickness is
one of those seemingly simple problems that, despite amazing scientific progress, we still
know very little about. Perhaps one day the exact cause of motion sickness will be found,
and with it, a completely effective way to prevent it, but that day is still on the
horizon.
