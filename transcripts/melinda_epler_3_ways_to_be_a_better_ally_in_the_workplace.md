title: 3 ways to be a better ally in the workplace
speaker: Melinda Epler
description: >-
 We're taught to believe that hard work and dedication will lead to success, but
 that's not always the case. Gender, race, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual
 orientation are among the many factors that affect our chances, says writer and
 advocate Melinda Epler, and it's up to each of us to be allies for those who face
 discrimination. In this actionable talk, Epler shares three ways to support
 people who are underrepresented in the workplace. "There's no magic wand for
 correcting diversity and inclusion," she says. "Change happens one person at a
 time, one act at a time, one word at a time."

In 2013, I was an executive at an international engineering firm in San Francisco. It was
my dream job. A culmination of all the skills that I've acquired over the years:
storytelling, social impact, behavior change. I was the head of marketing and culture and
I worked with the nation's largest health care systems, using technology and culture
change to radically reduce their energy and water use and to improve their social impact.
I was creating real change in the world. And it was the worst professional experience of
my life. I hit the glass ceiling hard. It hurt like hell. While there were bigger issues,
most of what happened were little behaviors and patterns that slowly chipped away at my
ability to do my work well. They ate away at my confidence, my leadership, my capacity to
innovate. For example, my first presentation at the company. I walk up to the front of the
room to give a presentation on the strategy that I believe is right for the company. The
one they hired me to create.

And I look around the room at my fellow executives. And I watch as they pick up their cell
phones and look down at their laptops. They're not paying attention. As soon as I start to
speak, the interruptions begin and people talk over me again and again and again. Some of
my ideas are flat out dismissed and then brought up by somebody else and championed. I was
the only woman in that room. And I could have used an ally. Little behaviors and pattern
like this, every day, again and again, they wear you down. Pretty soon, my energy was
absolutely tapped. At a real low point, I read an article about toxic workplace culture
and microaggressions. Microaggressions — everyday slights, insults, negative verbal and
nonverbal communication, whether intentional or not, that impede your ability to do your
work well. That sounded familiar. I started to realize that I wasn't failing. The culture
around me was failing me.

And I wasn't alone. Behaviors and patterns like this every day affect underrepresented
people of all backgrounds in the workplace. And that has a real impact on our colleagues,
on our companies and our collective capacity to innovate. So, in the tech industry, we
want quick solutions. But there is no magic wand for correcting diversity and inclusion.
Change happens one person at a time, one act at a time, one word at a time. We make a
mistake when we see diversity and inclusion as that side project over there the diversity
people are working on, rather than this work inside all of us that we need to do together.
And that work begins with unlearning what we know about success and opportunity. We've
been told our whole lives that if we work hard, that hard work pays off, we'd get what we
deserve, we'd live our dream. But that isn't true for everyone. Some people have to work
10 times as hard to get to the same place due to many barriers put in front of them by
society.

Your gender, your race, your ethnicity, your religion, your disability, your sexual
orientation, your class, your geography, all of these can give you more of fewer
opportunities for success. And that's where allyship comes in. Allyship is about
understanding that imbalance in opportunity and working to correct it. Allyship is really
seeing the person next to us. And the person missing, who should be standing next to us.
And first, just knowing what they're going through. And then, helping them succeed and
thrive with us. When we work together to develop more diverse and inclusive teams, data
shows we will be more innovative, more productive and more profitable. So, who is an ally?
All of us. We can all be allies for each other. As a white, cisgendered woman in the
United States, there are many ways I'm very privileged. And some ways I'm not. And I work
hard every day to be an ally for people with less privilege than me.

And I still need allies, too. In the tech industry, like in many industries, there are many
people who are underrepresented, or face barriers and discrimination. Women, people who
are nonbinary — so people who don't necessarily identify as man or woman — racial and
ethnic minorities, LGBTQIA, people with disabilities, veterans, anybody over age
35.

We have a major bias toward youth in the tech industry. And many others. There is always
someone with less privilege than you. On this stage, in this room. At your company, on
your team, in your city or town. So, people are allies for different reasons. Find your
reason. It could be for the business case, because data shows diverse and inclusive teams
will be more productive, more profitable and more innovative. It could be for fairness and
social justice. Because we have a long history of oppression and inequity that we need to
work on together. Or it could be for your kids, so your kids grow up with equal
opportunities. And they grow up creating equal opportunities for others. Find your reason.
For me, it's all three. Find your reason and step up to be there for someone who needs
you. So, what can you do as an ally? Start by doing no harm. It's our job as allies to know
what microaggressions are and to not do them.

It's our job as allies to listen, to learn, to unlearn and to relearn, and to make
mistakes and to keep learning. Give me your full attention. Close your laptops, put down
your cellphones and pay attention. If somebody is new or the only person in the room like
them, or they're just nervous, this is going to make a huge difference in how they show
up. Don't interrupt. Underrepresented people are more likely to be interrupted, so just
take a step back and listen. Echo and attribute. If I have a great idea, echo my idea and
then attribute it to me, and we thrive together. Learn the language I use to describe my
identity. Know how to pronounce my name. Know my pronouns — he, she, they. Know the
language I use to describe my disability, my ethnicity, my religion. This really matters
to people, so if you don't know, just ask. Listen and learn. An executive told me recently
that after doing allyship on his team, the whole team started to normalize calling
themselves out and each other out for interrupting.

"I'm so sorry I'm interrupting you right now, carry on." "Hey, she's got a great idea,
let's listen."Number two, advocate for underrepresented people in small ways. Intervene;
you can change the power dynamics in the room. If you see somebody is the only person in
the room like them and they are being belittled, they are being interrupted, do something,
say something. Invite underrepresented people to speak. And say no to panels without
underrepresented speakers. Refer someone for a job and encourage them to take that job and
to take new opportunities. And this one's really important — help normalize allyship. If
you're a person with privilege, it's easier for you to advocate for allies. So use that
privilege to create change. Three, change someone's life significantly. So, be there for
somebody throughout their career. Mentor or sponsor them, give them opportunities as they
grow. Volunteer — volunteer for a STEM program, serving underserved youth.

Transform your team to be more diverse and inclusive. And make real commitments to
creating change here. Hold yourself and your team accountable for creating change. And
lastly, help advocate for change across your company. When companies teach their people to
be allies, diversity and inclusion programs are stronger. You and I can be allies for each
other, whether we're inside or outside of work. So, I realized recently that I still have
lingering shame and fear from that moment in my career when I felt utterly alone, shut out
and unsupported. There are millions of people out there, like me, right now, feeling that
way. And it doesn't take much for us to be there for each other. And when we're there for
each other, when we support one another, we thrive together. And when we thrive, we build
better teams, better products and better companies. Allyship is powerful. Try it. Thank
you.
