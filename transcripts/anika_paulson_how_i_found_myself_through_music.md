The philosopher Plato once said, "Music gives a soul to the universe, wings to the mind,
flight to the imagination and life to everything." Music has always been a big part of my
life. To create and to perform music connects you to people countries and lifetimes away.
It connects you to the people you're playing with, to your audience and to yourself. When
I'm happy, when I'm sad, when I'm bored, when I'm stressed, I listen to and I create
music. When I was younger, I played piano; later, I took up guitar. And as I started high
school, music became a part of my identity. I was in every band, I was involved with every
musical fine arts event. Music surrounded me. It made me who I was, and it gave me a place
to belong. Now, I've always had this thing with rhythms. I remember being young, I would
walk down the hallways of my school and I would tap rhythms to myself on my leg with my
hands, or tapping my teeth. It was a nervous habit, and I was always nervous.

I think I liked the repetition of the rhythm — it was calming. Then in high school, I
started music theory, and it was the best class I've ever taken. We were learning about
music — things I didn't know, like theory and history. It was a class where we basically
just listened to a song, talked about what it meant to us and analyzed it, and figured out
what made it tick. Every Wednesday, we did something called "rhythmic dictation," and I
was pretty good at it. Our teacher would give us an amount of measures and a time
signature, and then he would speak a rhythm to us and we would have to write it down with
the proper rests and notes. Like this: ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta, ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a,
tuck-a. And I loved it. The simplicity of the rhythm — a basic two- to four- measure line
— and yet each of them almost told a story, like they had so much potential, and all you
had to do was add a melody.

Rhythms set a foundation for melodies and harmonies to play on top of. It gives structure
and stability. Now, music has these parts — rhythm, melody and harmony — just like our
lives. Where music has rhythm, we have routines and habits — things that help us to
remember what to do and to stay on track, and to just keep going. And you may not notice
it, but it's always there.

And it may seem simple, it may seem dull by itself, but it gives tempo and heartbeat. And
then things in your life add on to it, giving texture — that's your friends and your
family, and anything that creates a harmonic structure in your life and in your song, like
harmonies, cadences and anything that makes it polyphonic. And they create beautiful
chords and patterns.

And then there's you. You play on top of everything else, on top of the rhythms and the
beat because you're the melody. And things may change and develop, but no matter what we
do, we're still the same people. Throughout a song melodies develop, but it's still the
same song. No matter what you do, the rhythms are still there: the tempo and the heartbeat
... until I left, and I went to college and everything disappeared. When I first arrived at
university, I felt lost. And don't get me wrong — sometimes I loved it and it was great,
but other times, I felt like I had been left alone to fend for myself. It's like I had
been taken out of my natural environment, and put somewhere new, where the rhythms and the
harmonies and the form had gone away, and it was just me —

silence and my melody. And even that began to waver, because I didn't know what I was
doing. I didn't have any chords to structure myself, or a rhythm or a beat to know the
tempo.

And then I began to hear all these other sounds.

And they were off-time and off-key. And the more I was around them, the more my melody
started to sound like theirs. And slowly I began to lose myself, like I was being washed
away. But then the next moment —

I could hear it. And I could feel it. And it was me. And I was here. And it was different,
but not worse off. Just changed a little. Music is my way of coping with the changes in my
life. There's a beautiful connection between music and life. It can bind us to reality at
the same time it allows us to escape it. Music is something that lives inside of you. You
create it and you're created by it. Our lives are not only conducted by music, they're
also composed of it. So this may seem like a bit of a stretch, but hear me out: music is a
fundamental part of what we are and of everything around us. Now, music is my passion, but
physics also used to be an interest of mine. And the more I learned, the more I saw
connections between the two — especially regarding string theory. I know this is only one
of many theories, but it spoke to me. So, one aspect of string theory, at its simplest
form, is this: matter is made up of atoms, which are made up of protons and neutrons and
electrons, which are made up of quark.

And here's where the string part comes in. This quark is supposedly made up of little
coiled strings, and it's the vibrations of these strings that make everything what it
is. Michio Kaku once explained this in a lecture called, "The Universe in a Nutshell,"
where he says, "String theory is the simple idea that the four forces of the universe —
gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the two strong forces — can be viewed as music.
The music of tiny little rubber bands." In this lecture, he goes on to explain physics as
the laws of harmony between these strings; chemistry, as the melodies you can play on
these strings; and he states that the universe is a "symphony of strings." These strings
dictate the universe; they make up everything we see and everything we know. They're
musical notes, but they make us what we are and they hold us together. So you see,
everything is music.

When I look at the world, I see music all around us. When I look at myself, I see music.
And my life has been defined by music. I found myself through music. Music is everywhere,
and it is in everything. And it changes and it builds and it diminishes. But it's always
there, supporting us, connecting us to each other and showing us the beauty of the
universe. So if you ever feel lost, stop and listen for your song. Thank
you.
