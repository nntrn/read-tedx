In 1956, during a diplomatic reception in Moscow, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev told
Western Bloc ambassadors, "My vas pokhoronim!" His interpreter rendered that into English
as, "We will bury you!" This statement sent shockwaves through the Western world,
heightening the tension between the Soviet Union and the US who were in the thick of the
Cold War. Some believe this incident alone set East/West relations back a decade. As it
turns out, Khrushchev's remark was translated a bit too literally. Given the context, his
words should have been rendered as, "We will live to see you buried," meaning that
Communism would outlast Capitalism, a less threatening comment. Though the intended
meaning was eventually clarified, the initial impact of Khrushchev's apparent words put
the world on a path that could have led to nuclear armageddon. So now, given the
complexities of language and cultural exchange, how does this sort of thing not happen all
the time?

Much of the answer lies with the skill and training of interpreters to overcome language
barriers. For most of history, interpretation was mainly done consecutively, with speakers
and interpreters making pauses to allow each other to speak. But after the advent of radio
technology, a new simultaneous interpretations system was developed in the wake of World
War II. In the simultaneous mode interpreters instantaneously translate a speaker's words
into a microphone while he speaks. Without pauses, those in the audience can choose the
language in which they want to follow. On the surface, it all looks seamless, but behind
the scenes, human interpreters work incessantly to ensure every idea gets across as
intended. And that is no easy task. It takes about two years of training for already
fluent bilingual professionals to expand their vocabulary and master the skills necessary
to become a conference interpreter.

To get used to the unnatural task of speaking while they listen, students shadow speakers
and repeat their every word exactly as heard in the same language. In time, they begin to
paraphrase what is said, making stylistic adjustments as they go. At some point, a second
language is introduced. Practicing in this way creates new neural pathways in the
interpreter's brain, and the constant effort of reformulation gradually becomes second
nature. Over time and through much hard work, the interpreter masters a vast array of
tricks to keep up with speed, deal with challenging terminology, and handle a multitude of
foreign accents. They may resort to acronyms to shorten long names, choose generic terms
over specific, or refer to slides and other visual aides. They can even leave a term in
the original language, while they search for the most accurate equivalent. Interpreters
are also skilled at keeping aplomb in the face of chaos.

Remember, they have no control over who is going to say what, or how articulate the
speaker will sound. A curveball can be thrown at any time. Also, they often perform to
thousands of people and in very intimidating settings, like the UN General Assembly. To
keep their emotions in check, they carefully prepare for an assignment, building
glossaries in advance, reading voraciously about the subject matter, and reviewing
previous talks on the topic. Finally, interpreters work in pairs. While one colleague is
busy translating incoming speeches in real time, the other gives support by locating
documents, looking up words, and tracking down pertinent information. Because simultaneous
interpretation requires intense concentration, every 30 minutes, the pair switches roles.
Success is heavily dependent on skillful collaboration. Language is complex, and when
abstract or nuanced concepts get lost in translation, the consequences may be
catastrophic.

As Margaret Atwood famously noted, "War is what happens when language fails." Conference
interpreters of all people are aware of that and work diligently behind the scenes to make
sure it never does.
