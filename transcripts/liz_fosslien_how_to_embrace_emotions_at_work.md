No matter how hard you might try, you can't just flip a switch when you step into the
office and turn your emotions off. Feeling feelings is part of being human.[The Way We
Work]A pervasive myth exists that emotions don't belong at work, and this often leads us
to mistakenly equate professionalism with being stoic or even cold. But research shows
that in the moments when our colleagues drop their glossy professional presentation, we're
actually much more likely to believe what they're telling us. We feel connected to the
people around us. We try harder, we perform better and we're just generally kinder. So
it's about time that we learn how to embrace emotion at work. Now, that's not to say you
should suddenly become a feelings fire hose. A line exists between sharing, which builds
trust, and oversharing, which destroys it. If you suddenly let your feelings run wild at
work and give people far more information than they bargained for, you make everyone
around you uncomfortable and you also undermine yourself.

You're more likely to be seen as weak or lacking self awareness, so, great to say you
weren't feeling well last night â€” you don't need to go into every lurid detail about how
you got reacquainted with your half-digested dinner. So there's a wide spectrum of
emotional expression. On one hand, you have under-emoters, or people who have a hard time
talking about their feelings, and on the other end are over-emoters, those who constantly
share everything that's going on inside, and neither of these make for a healthy
workplace. So what's the balance between these two extremes? It's something called
selective vulnerability. Selective vulnerability is opening up while still prioritizing
stability and psychological safety, both for you and for your colleagues. Luckily, anyone
can learn to be selectively vulnerable, with practice. Here are four ways to get started.
First, flag your feelings without becoming emotionally leaky.

Bad moods are contagious, and even if you're not vocalizing what you're feeling, chances
are your body language or your expressions are a dead giveaway. So if you are crossing
your arms or hammering on your keyboard, your coworkers are going to know you're upset.
And if you don't say anything, they might start to think it's about them and get worried.
So if you are reacting to a non-work-related event, so traffic for example, just flag it.
You don't need to go into detail. You can say something as simple as "I'm having a bad
morning. It has nothing to do with you." Now if it's a work-related event that's causing
you to feel strong emotions, that brings us to point number two. Try to understand the need
behind your emotion, and then address that need. If you suddenly start to find everyone
around you irritating, sit back and reflect on that. And it might be that you're irritable
because you're anxious, and you're anxious because you're worried about hitting a looming
deadline.

And in that case, you can go back to your team to address that need and say something
like, "I want to make sure I get everything done ahead of the deadline. Can you help me
put together a realistic plan to do that?" If you're thinking of sharing, try and put
yourself in the other person's shoes. So if what you're about to say would help you feel
more supported and better understand the situation, then go ahead and share it. But if it
gives you any kind of pause, you might want to leave it out. And finally, read the room and
provide a path forward. If everyone on your team has been pulling long hours, and you
notice that one of your colleagues seems particularly deflated or anxious, you can
acknowledge that and show some empathy, but then try to give them something actionable
that they could hold on to. And in this case, you could suggest that you go to your
manager and ask that your weekly meeting be pushed back a day so you both have more time
to work.

You're showing you're invested in their success, but also that you care about their
well-being. When we can be honest about what we feel, and freely suggest ideas, make
mistakes and just not have to hide every piece of who we are, we're much more likely to
stay at the company for a long time. We're also happier and more productive. So take a
moment to reflect on the emotional expression that you bring to work each day. And if you
are prone to oversharing, try editing. And if you're a little bit more reserved, look for
moments when you can open up to your colleagues and be a bit vulnerable. And chances are,
there will be a big difference in how people respond to you. And selective vulnerability
might just become one of your most valuable tools.
