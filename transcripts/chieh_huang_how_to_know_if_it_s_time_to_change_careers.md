I was not one of those kids that knew exactly what they wanted to do when they were
growing up. In the last 15 years of my career, I've been an English teacher, attorney,
video game creator and now, a toilet paper salesman, selling millions of rolls of toilet
paper a year.[The Way We Work]Life is about finding the intersection of what you really,
really love with what you're really, really good at. As simple as it sounds, it's really
not that easy to find. After a brief stint as an English teacher, I went to law school and
ended up becoming an attorney at a big law firm here in New York City. Like most
Americans, for the next two, three years, I was holding on to my job for dear life,
working really late hours at a job that I thought maybe I was good at but certainly not
one that I really loved. I then came upon the epiphany that it takes years if not tens of
thousands of hours to get really good at something.

I really didn't have a lot of time to waste. This talk isn't for those looking to quit
their job because they don't like their boss or they had a long day at work. This is for
those that are ready to make the completely scary leap into a brand-new career. So as you
think about making a career change, here are a few tips I hope you consider and a few
things I've picked up along the way. First, there's three things to think about before
you're ready to move on. Number one: professional life is about learning. If you're not
even interested in learning anymore, that's a huge red flag that there might not be a
future for you in that industry. Number two: career changes are often gut-driven. If you
constantly have sleepless nights where you're wide awake staring at the ceiling thinking,
"Oh, man. I can't live with myself if I never try to make this change or if I don't even
actually investigate it," then trust your gut.

It might be time for that career change. On the flip side, one reason to not move on is
short-term pain. If you don't like your boss or people at the office are grating on you,
that's actually not a good reason to absolutely change your career, because when you do
change a career, you generally have to start from the bottom, and you'll probably feel a
lot of short-term pain, whether it's through a lack of salary or lack of a title. Pain at
any job is inevitable. So now you're convinced that it's time to change your career. Then
there's three things to do immediately. First: network, network, network. No one ever
builds a career without a good mentor or a good support network. What I mean by networking
is getting all the great advice that you can possibly get. Technology has made it so
simple to reach out to new people to say, "Hey, I'm thinking about making a career change.
Do you have just five minutes to chat with me?" That passion and that hunger and that
ability to be a sponge really attracts awesome mentors and people willing to give you
their time to give you some good advice.

So go out there and meet new people. The second thing you need to do immediately is shore
up your finances. The reality is, when you change your career, you'll either start with a
job with a lower title or lower pay or maybe even no pay, especially if you're starting
your own business. So going out there and making sure your finances are in order to make
the transition less painful is really, really important. For me personally, as I made the
transition from being an attorney over to a video game creator, I wanted to have at least
six to 12 months of personal runway in the bank. Six to 12 months might not be the right
number for you, but be honest with yourself on what that number should be. Number three, if
you're not ready to make the full jump right at this moment, then get your side hustle on.
Side hustles could be anything from volunteering with an organization that's in the new
industry you want to go into, could be starting your business part-time on the
weekends.

It's a free way to get a taste to see if you really love something. So you're ready to make
the move or maybe you already made the move. Here are three things you should think about
doing, right now. One: do not — I repeat — do not burn bridges. You spent years building
those bridges, why burn them now? The world is such a small place, especially with all
these online platforms, that, believe me, you will see these people again and probably in
the most inopportune times. Number two: take stock of what you've learned in your previous
career or careers. Most likely, a lot of those things are really applicable to your new
job and your new career, whether it's interacting with people, playing on a team or
dealing with jerks and assholes. All those things are really universally applicable.
You'll find jerks no matter what industry you're in; no one's immune to it, everyone's got
to figure it out, and you probably know how to do it already. Lastly, when you start your
new job, you're going to be nervous.

But don't worry, take a deep breath, because this is what I want to tell you: you're part
of a new team now, and everyone around you is rooting for your success, because your
success is their success. So welcome to your new career.
