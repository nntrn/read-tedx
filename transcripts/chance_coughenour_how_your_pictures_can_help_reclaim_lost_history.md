 Digital archaeologist Chance Coughenour is using pictures -- your pictures -- to
 reclaim antiquities that have been lost to conflict and disaster. After
 crowdsourcing photographs of destroyed monuments, museums and artifacts,
 Coughenour uses advanced technology called photogrammetry to create 3D reconstructions,
 preserving the memory of our global, shared, human heritage. Find out more about

Why do people deliberately destroy cultural heritage? By doing so, do they believe they're
erasing our history? Our cultural memory? It's true that we are losing cultural heritage
to erosion and natural disasters, but this is something that is simply difficult to avoid.
I'm here to show you today how we can use pictures — your pictures — to reclaim the
history that is being lost using innovative technology and the effort of volunteers. In the
early 20th century, archaeologists discovered hundreds of statues and artifacts at the
ancient city of Hatra, in northern Iraq. Statues like this one were found in fragments,
some of them missing their heads or arms, yet the clothing that they are wearing and their
pose can still tell us their story. For example, we believe that by wearing a knee-length
tunic and open bare feet, this was representative of a priest. However, with a closer look
at this particular piece, we can see that this tunic being worn was elaborately decorated,
which has led many researchers to believe this was actually a statue of a king performing
his religious functions. When the Mosul Cultural Museum opened in 1952 in northern Iraq,
this statue, as well as others, were placed there to preserve them for future
generations.

Following the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, a few statues and artifacts were relocated
to Baghdad, but this statue remained. Then in February of last year, a video was released,
and it instantly went viral. Maybe some of you remember seeing it. Here's a short
clip.

(Singing in Arabic)(Singing ends)Not a very pleasant sight, right? Did you notice anything
familiar in the video? There it is. There is that very statue, as it was toppled over,
breaking into pieces. When Matthew Vincent and I saw this video, we were shocked. Since we
are archaeologists using innovative technology for digital preservation, an idea sprung to
mind. Maybe we can crowdsource the images that were taken of these artifacts before they
were destroyed, to create digital reconstructions. If we can do that, maybe we can put
them into a virtual museum to tell that story. And so two weeks after we saw this video,
we started the project called Project Mosul. Remember the pictures of the statue I showed
you before? This is actually the crowdsourced reconstruction of it before it was
destroyed. Now, many of you may be wondering, how exactly does this work? Well, the key to
this technology is called photogrammetry, and it was invented here, in
Germany.

It is the technology that allows us to use two-dimensional images taken of the same object
from different angles to create a 3D model. I know you may be thinking this sounds like
magic — but it's not. Let me show you how it works. Here are two crowdsourced images of
the same statue. What the computer can do is it can detect similar features between the
photographs — similar features of the object. Then, by using multiple photos, in this
case, it can begin to reconstruct the object in 3D. In this case, you have the position of
the cameras when each image was taken, shown in blue. Now, this is a partial
reconstruction, I admit, but why would I say partial? Well, simply because the statue was
positioned against a wall. We don't have photographs taken of it from the back. If I
wanted to complete a full digital reconstruction of this statue, I would need a proper
camera, tripods, proper lighting, but we simply can't do that with crowdsourced
images.

Think about it: How many of you, when you visit a museum, take photographs of all parts of
the statue, even the back side of it? Well, maybe if some of you find Michelangelo's David
interesting, I guess —

But the thing is, if we can find more images of this object, we can improve the 3D
model. When we started the project, we started it with the Mosul Museum in mind. We figured
we may get a few images, some people interested, make one or two virtual reconstructions,
but we had no idea that we had sparked something that would grow so quickly. Before we
knew it, we realized it was obvious: we could apply this same idea to lost heritage
anywhere. And so, we decided to change the name of the project to Rekrei. Then, in the
summer of last year, "The Economist" magazine's media lab reached out to us. They asked
us, "Hey, would you like us to build a virtual museum to put the reconstructions back
inside, to tell the story?" Can you imagine us saying no? Of course not. We said yes! We
were so excited. This was exactly the initial dream of that project. And so now, any of
you can experience RecoVR Mosul on your phone, using Google Cardboard or a tablet or even
YouTube 360.Here is a screenshot from the virtual museum.

And there it is ... the partial reconstruction of the statue, as well as the Lion of
Mosul, the first reconstruction completed by our project. Although the video doesn't
explicitly show the Lion of Mosul being destroyed, we have many other examples of large
artifacts being destroyed that were simply too large to have been stolen. For example, the
Gate of Nimrud in northern Iraq. This is a digital reconstruction from before, and this is
actually during the destruction. Or the Lion of Al-Lāt, in Palmyra, Syria: before ... and
after. Although virtual reconstructions are primarily the main focus of our project, some
people have been asking the question: Can we print them in 3D? We believe 3D printing
doesn't offer a straightforward solution to lost heritage. Once an object is destroyed,
it's gone. But 3D printing does offer an addition to tell that story. For example, I can
show you here ... There is the statue from Hatra and the Lion of Mosul.

Thank you. Now, if you look closely, you'll notice that there are some parts that have been
printed in color, and some parts that are in white or gray. This part was added simply to
hold the statues up. This works the same way if you visit a museum, and a statue is found
in fragments; it's put together for the people to see it. This makes sense, right?
However, we're much more interested in what virtual reality has to offer for lost
heritage. Here is an example of one of the tower tombs that was destroyed in Palmyra. Using
Sketchfab's online viewer, we can show that we have reconstructed three parts of the
exterior of the tomb, but we also have photos of the inside, so we're beginning to create
a reconstruction of the wall and the ceiling. Archaeologists worked there for many, many
years, so we also have architectural drawing plans of this lost heritage. Unfortunately, we
are not only losing cultural heritage to areas of conflict and at war — we're also losing
it to natural disasters.

This is a 3D model of Durbar Square in Kathmandu, before the earthquake that occurred last
April ... and this is after. You may be thinking, you didn't create these 3D models with
only tourist photographs, and that's true. But what this represents is the ability for
large, public organizations and private industry to come together for initiatives like
ours. And so one of the major challenges of our project, really, is to find photographs
that were taken before something happens, right? Well, the internet is basically a
database with millions of images, right? Exactly. So we have begun to develop a tool that
allows us to extract images from websites like Flickr, based on their geotags, to complete
reconstructions. Because we're not only losing cultural heritage to natural disasters and
in war, but we're also losing it to something else. Any idea, just looking at these two
pictures? Maybe it's a little difficult to remember, but only a few weeks ago, this was
the example of human destruction by human stupidity.

Because a tourist in Lisbon wanted to climb onto this statue and take a selfie with it
—

and pulled it down with him. So we're already finding photographs to complete a digital
reconstruction of this. We need to remember that the destruction of cultural heritage isn't
a recent phenomenon. In the 16th century, European priests and explorers burned thousands
of Maya books in the Americas, of which we only have a handful left. Fast-forward to 2001,
when the Taliban blew up the Bamiyan Buddhas in Afghanistan. You see, cultural heritage is
about our shared global history. It helps us connect with our ancestors and their stories,
but we're losing pieces of it every day to natural disasters and in areas of conflict. Of
course, the loss of human life is the most heartbreaking loss ... but cultural heritage
offers us a way to preserve the memory of the people for future generations. We need your
help to reclaim the history that is being lost. Will you join us?
