title: Does grammar matter?
speaker: Andreea S. Calude
description: >-
 It can be hard sometimes, when speaking, to remember all of the grammatical rules
 that guide us when we're writing. When is it right to say "the dog and me" and
 when should it be "the dog and I"? Does it even matter? Andreea S. Calude dives
 into the age-old argument between linguistic prescriptivists and descriptivists â€”
 who have two very different opinions on the matter. [Directed by Mike Schell,
 narrated by Addison Anderson].

You're telling a friend an amazing story, and you just get to the best part when suddenly
he interrupts, "The alien and I," not "Me and the alien." Most of us would probably be
annoyed, but aside from the rude interruption, does your friend have a point? Was your
sentence actually grammatically incorrect? And if he still understood it, why does it
even matter? From the point of view of linguistics, grammar is a set of patterns for how
words are put together to form phrases or clauses, whether spoken or in writing. Different
languages have different patterns. In English, the subject normally comes first,
followed by the verb, and then the object, while in Japanese and many other languages,
the order is subject, object, verb. Some scholars have tried to identify patterns common
to all languages, but apart from some basic features, like having nouns or verbs, few of
these so-called linguistic universals have been found.

And while any language needs consistent patterns to function, the study of these patterns
opens up an ongoing debate between two positions known as prescriptivism and
descriptivism. Grossly simplified, prescriptivists think a given language should follow
consistent rules, while descriptivists see variation and adaptation as a natural and
necessary part of language. For much of history, the vast majority of language was spoken.
But as people became more interconnected and writing gained importance, written language
was standardized to allow broader communication and ensure that people in different parts
of a realm could understand each other. In many languages, this standard form came to be
considered the only proper one, despite being derived from just one of many spoken
varieties, usually that of the people in power. Language purists worked to establish and
propagate this standard by detailing a set of rules that reflected the established grammar
of their times.

And rules for written grammar were applied to spoken language, as well. Speech patterns
that deviated from the written rules were considered corruptions, or signs of low social
status, and many people who had grown up speaking in these ways were forced to adopt the
standardized form. More recently, however, linguists have understood that speech is a
separate phenomenon from writing with its own regularities and patterns. Most of us learn
to speak at such an early age that we don't even remember it. We form our spoken
repertoire through unconscious habits, not memorized rules. And because speech also uses
mood and intonation for meaning, its structure is often more flexible, adapting to the
needs of speakers and listeners. This could mean avoiding complex clauses that are hard to
parse in real time, making changes to avoid awkward pronounciation, or removing sounds to
make speech faster. The linguistic approach that tries to understand and map such
differences without dictating correct ones is known as descriptivism.

Rather than deciding how language should be used, it describes how people actually use it,
and tracks the innovations they come up with in the process. But while the debate between
prescriptivism and descriptivism continues, the two are not mutually exclusive. At its
best, prescriptivism is useful for informing people about the most common established
patterns at a given point in time. This is important, not only for formal contexts, but
it also makes communication easier between non-native speakers from different backgrounds.
Descriptivism, on the other hand, gives us insight into how our minds work and the
instinctive ways in which we structure our view of the world. Ultimately, grammar is best
thought of as a set of linguistic habits that are constantly being negotiated and
reinvented by the entire group of language users. Like language itself, it's a wonderful
and complex fabric woven through the contributions of speakers and listeners, writers and
readers, prescriptivists and descriptivists, from both near and far.
