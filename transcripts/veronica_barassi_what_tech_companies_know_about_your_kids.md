title: What tech companies know about your kids
speaker: Veronica Barassi
description: >-
 The digital platforms you and your family use every day -- from online games to
 education apps and medical portals -- may be collecting and selling your
 children's data, says anthropologist Veronica Barassi. Sharing her eye-opening
 research, Barassi urges parents to look twice at digital terms and conditions
 instead of blindly accepting them -- and to demand protections that ensure their
 kids' data doesn't skew their future.

Every day, every week, we agree to terms and conditions. And when we do this, we provide
companies with the lawful right to do whatever they want with our data and with the data
of our children. Which makes us wonder: how much data are we giving away of children, and
what are its implications? I'm an anthropologist, and I'm also the mother of two little
girls. And I started to become interested in this question in 2015 when I suddenly
realized that there were vast — almost unimaginable amounts of data traces that are being
produced and collected about children. So I launched a research project, which is called
Child Data Citizen, and I aimed at filling in the blank. Now you may think that I'm here to
blame you for posting photos of your children on social media, but that's not really the
point. The problem is way bigger than so-called "sharenting." This is about systems, not
individuals. You and your habits are not to blame. For the very first time in history, we
are tracking the individual data of children from long before they're born — sometimes
from the moment of conception, and then throughout their lives.

You see, when parents decide to conceive, they go online to look for "ways to get
pregnant," or they download ovulation-tracking apps. When they do get pregnant, they post
ultrasounds of their babies on social media, they download pregnancy apps or they consult
Dr. Google for all sorts of things, like, you know — for "miscarriage risk when flying" or
"abdominal cramps in early pregnancy." I know because I've done it — and many times. And
then, when the baby is born, they track every nap, every feed, every life event on
different technologies. And all of these technologies transform the baby's most intimate
behavioral and health data into profit by sharing it with others. So to give you an idea of
how this works, in 2019, the British Medical Journal published research that showed that
out of 24 mobile health apps, 19 shared information with third parties. And these third
parties shared information with 216 other organizations.

Of these 216 other fourth parties, only three belonged to the health sector. The other
companies that had access to that data were big tech companies like Google, Facebook or
Oracle, they were digital advertising companies and there was also a consumer credit
reporting agency. So you get it right: ad companies and credit agencies may already have
data points on little babies. But mobile apps, web searches and social media are really
just the tip of the iceberg, because children are being tracked by multiple technologies
in their everyday lives. They're tracked by home technologies and virtual assistants in
their homes. They're tracked by educational platforms and educational technologies in
their schools. They're tracked by online records and online portals at their doctor's
office. They're tracked by their internet-connected toys, their online games and many,
many, many, many other technologies. So during my research, a lot of parents came up to me
and they were like, "So what?

Why does it matter if my children are being tracked? We've got nothing to hide." Well, it
matters. It matters because today individuals are not only being tracked, they're also
being profiled on the basis of their data traces. Artificial intelligence and predictive
analytics are being used to harness as much data as possible of an individual life from
different sources: family history, purchasing habits, social media comments. And then they
bring this data together to make data-driven decisions about the individual. And these
technologies are used everywhere. Banks use them to decide loans. Insurance uses them to
decide premiums. Recruiters and employers use them to decide whether one is a good fit for
a job or not. Also the police and courts use them to determine whether one is a potential
criminal or is likely to recommit a crime. We have no knowledge or control over the ways in
which those who buy, sell and process our data are profiling us and our
children.

But these profiles can come to impact our rights in significant ways. To give you an
example, in 2018 the "New York Times" published the news that the data that had been
gathered through online college-planning services — that are actually completed by
millions of high school kids across the US who are looking for a college program or a
scholarship — had been sold to educational data brokers. Now, researchers at Fordham who
studied educational data brokers revealed that these companies profiled kids as young as
two on the basis of different categories: ethnicity, religion, affluence, social
awkwardness and many other random categories. And then they sell these profiles together
with the name of the kid, their home address and the contact details to different
companies, including trade and career institutions, student loans and student credit card
companies. To push the boundaries, the researchers at Fordham asked an educational data
broker to provide them with a list of 14-to-15-year-old girls who were interested in
family planning services.

The data broker agreed to provide them the list. So imagine how intimate and how intrusive
that is for our kids. But educational data brokers are really just an example. The truth
is that our children are being profiled in ways that we cannot control but that can
significantly impact their chances in life. So we need to ask ourselves: can we trust these
technologies when it comes to profiling our children? Can we? My answer is no. As an
anthropologist, I believe that artificial intelligence and predictive analytics can be
great to predict the course of a disease or to fight climate change. But we need to
abandon the belief that these technologies can objectively profile humans and that we can
rely on them to make data-driven decisions about individual lives. Because they can't
profile humans. Data traces are not the mirror of who we are. Humans think one thing and
say the opposite, feel one way and act differently.

Algorithmic predictions or our digital practices cannot account for the unpredictability
and complexity of human experience. But on top of that, these technologies are always —
always — in one way or another, biased. You see, algorithms are by definition sets of
rules or steps that have been designed to achieve a specific result, OK? But these sets of
rules or steps cannot be objective, because they've been designed by human beings within a
specific cultural context and are shaped by specific cultural values. So when machines
learn, they learn from biased algorithms, and they often learn from biased databases as
well. At the moment, we're seeing the first examples of algorithmic bias. And some of these
examples are frankly terrifying. This year, the AI Now Institute in New York published a
report that revealed that the AI technologies that are being used for predictive policing
have been trained on "dirty" data.

This is basically data that had been gathered during historical periods of known racial
bias and nontransparent police practices. Because these technologies are being trained
with dirty data, they're not objective, and their outcomes are only amplifying and
perpetrating police bias and error. So I think we are faced with a fundamental problem in
our society. We are starting to trust technologies when it comes to profiling human
beings. We know that in profiling humans, these technologies are always going to be biased
and are never really going to be accurate. So what we need now is actually political
solution. We need governments to recognize that our data rights are our human
rights.(Applause and cheers)Until this happens, we cannot hope for a more just future. I
worry that my daughters are going to be exposed to all sorts of algorithmic discrimination
and error. You see the difference between me and my daughters is that there's no public
record out there of my childhood.

There's certainly no database of all the stupid things that I've done and thought when I
was a teenager.

But for my daughters this may be different. The data that is being collected from them
today may be used to judge them in the future and can come to prevent their hopes and
dreams. I think that's it's time. It's time that we all step up. It's time that we start
working together as individuals, as organizations and as institutions, and that we demand
greater data justice for us and for our children before it's too late. Thank
you.
