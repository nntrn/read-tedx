title: Forget multitasking, try monotasking
speaker: Paolo Cardini
description: >-
 People don't just cook anymore -- they're cooking, texting, talking on the phone,
 watching YouTube and uploading photos of the awesome meal they just made.
 Designer Paolo Cardini questions the efficiency of our multitasking world and
 makes the case for -- gasp -- "monotasking."

I'm a designer and an educator. I'm a multitasking person, and I push my students to fly
through a very creative, multitasking design process. But how efficient is, really, this
multitasking? Let's consider for a while the option of monotasking. A couple of examples.
Look at that. This is my multitasking activity result. 

So trying to cook, answering the phone, writing SMS, and maybe uploading some pictures
about this awesome barbecue. So someone tells us the story about supertaskers, so this two
percent of people who are able to control multitasking environment. But what about
ourselves, and what about our reality? When's the last time you really enjoyed just the
voice of your friend? So this is a project I'm working on, and this is a series of front
covers to downgrade our super, hyper â€” 

to downgrade our super, hyper-mobile phones into the essence of their function. Another
example: Have you ever been to Venice? How beautiful it is to lose ourselves in these
little streets on the island. But our multitasking reality is pretty different, and full
of tons of information. So what about something like that to rediscover our sense of
adventure? I know that it could sound pretty weird to speak about mono when the number of
possibilities is so huge, but I push you to consider the option of focusing on just one
task, or maybe turning your digital senses totally off. So nowadays, everyone could produce
his mono product. Why not? So find your monotask spot within the multitasking world. Thank
you.
