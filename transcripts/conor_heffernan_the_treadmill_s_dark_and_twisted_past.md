 The constant thud underneath your feet. The constrained space. The monotony of
 going nowhere fast. Running on a treadmill can certainly feel like torture, but
 did you know it was originally used for that very purpose? Conor Heffernan

The constant thud underneath your feet, the constrained space, and the monotony of going
nowhere fast. It feels like hours have gone by, but it's only been eleven minutes, and you
wonder, "Why am I torturing myself? This thing has got to be considered a cruel and
unusual punishment."Actually, that's exactly what it is, or was. You see, in the 1800s,
treadmills were created to punish English prisoners. At the time, the English prison
system was abysmally bad. Execution and deportation were often the punishments of choice,
and those who were locked away faced hours of solitude in filthy cells. So social
movements led by religious groups, philanthropies, and celebrities, like Charles Dickens,
sought to change these dire conditions and help reform the prisoners. When their movement
succeeded, entire prisons were remodeled and new forms of rehabilitation, such as the
treadmill, were introduced. Here's how the original version, invented in 1818 by English
engineer Sir William Cubitt, worked.

Prisoners stepped on 24 spokes of a large paddle wheel. As the wheel turned, the prisoner
was forced to keep stepping up or risk falling off, similar to modern stepper machines.
Meanwhile, the rotation made gears pump out water, crush grain, or power mills, which is
where the name "treadmill" originated. These devices were seen as a fantastic way of
whipping prisoners into shape, and that added benefit of powering mills helped to rebuild
a British economy decimated by the Napoleonic Wars. It was a win for all concerned, except
the prisoners. It's estimated that, on average, prisoners spent six or so hours a day on
treadmills, the equivalent of climbing 5,000 to 14,000 feet. 14,000 feet is roughly Mount
Everest's halfway point. Imagine doing that five days a week with little food. Cubitt's
idea quickly spread across the British Empire and America. Within a decade of its
creation, over 50 English prisons boasted a treadmill, and America, a similar
amount. Unsurprisingly, the exertion combined with poor nutrition saw many prisoners suffer
breakdowns and injuries, not that prison guards seemed to care.

In 1824, New York prison guard James Hardie credited the device with taming his more 
boisterous inmates, writing that the "monotonous steadiness, and not its
severity...constitutes its terror," a quote many still agree with. And treadmills lasted in
England until the late 19th century, when they were banned for being excessively cruel
under the Prison's Act of 1898.But of course the torture device returned with a vengeance,
this time targeting the unsuspecting public. In 1911, a treadmill patent was registered
in the U.S., and by 1952, the forerunner for today's modern treadmill had been
created. When the jogging craze hit the U.S. in the 1970s, the treadmill was thrust back
into the limelight as an easy and convenient way to improve aerobic fitness, and lose
unwanted pounds, which, to be fair, it's pretty good at doing. And the machine has
maintained its popularity since. So the next time you voluntarily subject yourself to what
was once a cruel and unusual punishment, just be glad you can control when you'll hop
off.
