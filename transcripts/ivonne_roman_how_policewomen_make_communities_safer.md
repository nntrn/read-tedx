title: How policewomen make communities safer
speaker: Ivonne Roman
description: >-
 Less than 13 percent of police officers in the United States are women -- despite
 their proven effectiveness in diffusing violent situations and reducing the use
 of force. Drawing on more than two decades of experience as a police officer and
 chief, TED Fellow Ivonne Roman shares how a simple change to police academy
 physical fitness tests could help build a more balanced force that benefits
 communities and officers alike.

I've been a police officer in an urban city for nearly 25 years. That's crazy, right? And
in that time, I've served in every rank, from police officer to police chief. A few years
ago, I noticed something alarming. Starting in 2014, I started monitoring recruits as they
cycled through police academies in the state of New Jersey, and I found that women were
failing at rates between 65 and 80 percent, due to varying aspects of the physical fitness
test. I learned that a change in policy now required recruits to pass the fitness exam
within 10 short workout sessions. This had the greatest impact on women. The change meant
that recruits had about three weeks out of a five-month-long academy to pass the fitness
exam. This just didn't make sense, though. Police agencies and police recruits had made
huge investments to get those recruits into the academy. Police recruits had passed
lengthy background checks, they had passed medical and psychological exams, they had quit
their jobs.

And many had spent more than 2,000 dollars in fees and equipment just to get kicked out
within the first three weeks? The dire situation in New Jersey led me to examine the status
of women in policing across the United States. I found that women make up less than 13
percent of police officers. A number that hasn't changed much in the past 20 years. And
they make up just three percent of police chiefs as of 2013, the last time the data was
collected. We know that we can improve those rates. Other countries like Canada, Australia
and the UK have nearly twice the amount of policewomen. And New Zealand is steadily
marching towards their goal of recruit gender parity by 2021. Other countries are actively
working to increase the number of women in policing, because they know of a vast body of
research evidence, spanning more than 50 years, detailing the advantages to women in
policing. From that research, we know that policewomen are less likely to use force or to
be accused of excessive force.

We know that policewomen are less likely to be named in a lawsuit or a citizen complaint.
We know that the mere presence of a policewoman reduces the use of force among other
officers. And we know that policewomen are met with the same rates of force as their male
counterparts, and sometimes more, and yet they're more successful in defusing violent or
aggressive behavior overall. So there are vast advantages to women in policing, and we're
losing them to arbitrary fitness standards. The problem is, the United States has nearly
18,000 police agencies — 18,000 agencies with wildly varying fitness standards. We know
that a majority of academies rely on a masculine ideal of policing that works to decrease
the number of women in policing. These types of academies overemphasize physical strength,
with much less attention spent to subjects like community policing, problem-solving and
interpersonal communication skills. This results in training that does not mirror the
realities of policing.

Physical agility is but a small component of police work. Much of an officer's day is
spent mediating interpersonal conflicts. That's the reality of policing. These are my
babies. And we can reduce the disparity in policing by changing exams that produce
disparate outcomes. The federal courts have stated that men and women simply are not
physiologically the same for the purposes of physical fitness programs. And that's based
on science. Respected institutions that law enforcement deeply respects, like the FBI, the
US Marshals Service, the DEA and even the US military — they rigorously test fitness
programs to ensure they measure fitness without gender-disparate outcomes. Why is that?
Because recruiting is expensive. They want to recruit and retain qualified candidates. You
know what else the research finds? Well-trained women are as capable as their male
counterparts in overall fitness, but more importantly, in how they police. The
law-enforcement community is admittedly experiencing a recruitment crisis.

Yet, if they truly want to increase the number of applicants, they can. We can easily
recruit more women and reap all those research benefits by training well-qualified
candidates to pass validated, work-related, physiologically-based fitness exams, as
required by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. We can increase the number of women, we can
reduce that gender disparity, by simply changing exams that produce disparate outcomes. We
have the tools. We have the research, we have the science, we have the law. This, my
friends, should be a very easy fix. Thank you.
