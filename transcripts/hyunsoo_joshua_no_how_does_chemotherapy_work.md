title: How does chemotherapy work?

 During World War I, scientists were trying to develop an antidote to the
 poisonous yellow cloud known as mustard gas. They discovered the gas was
 irrevocably damaging the bone marrow of affected soldiers. This gave the
 scientists an idea: cancer cells and bone marrow both replicate rapidly. Could
 mustard gas be used to fight cancer? Hyunsoo No details the discovery and
 development of chemotherapy. [Directed by Artrake Studio, narrated by Addison

During World War I, one of the horrors of trench warfare was a poisonous yellow cloud 
called mustard gas. For those unlucky enough to be exposed, it made the air impossible to
breathe, burned their eyes, and caused huge blisters on exposed skin. Scientists tried
desperately to develop an antidote to this vicious weapon of war. In the process they
discovered the gas was irrevocably damaging the bone marrow of affected soldiers— halting
its ability to make blood cells. Despite these awful effects, it gave scientists an
idea. Cancer cells share a characteristic with bone marrow: both replicate rapidly. So
could one of the atrocities of war become a champion in the fight against cancer?
Researchers in the 1930s investigated this idea by injecting compounds derived from
mustard gas into the veins of cancer patients. It took time and trial and error to find 
treatments that did more good than harm, but by the end of World War II, they discovered
what became known as the first chemotherapy drugs. Today, there are more than
100.

Chemotherapy drugs are delivered through pills and injections and use "cytotoxic agents,"
which means compounds that are toxic to living cells. Essentially, these medicines cause
some level of harm to all cells in the body— even healthy ones. But they reserve their
most powerful effects for rapidly-dividing cells, which is precisely the hallmark of
cancer. Take, for example, those first chemotherapy drugs, which are still used today and 
are called alkylating agents. They’re injected into the bloodstream, which delivers them
to cells all over the body. Once inside, when the cell exposes its DNA in order to copy
it, they damage the building blocks of DNA’s double helix structure, which can lead to
cell death unless the damage is repaired. Because cancer cells multiply rapidly, they
take in a high concentration of alkylating agents, and their DNA is frequently exposed 
and rarely repaired.

So they die off more often than most other cells, which have time to fix damaged DNA and
don’t accumulate the same concentrations of alkylating agents. Another form of
chemotherapy involves compounds called microtubule stabilizers. Cells have small tubes
that assemble to help with cell division and DNA replication, then break back down. When
microtubule stabilizers get inside a cell, they keep those tiny tubes from
disassembling. That prevents the cell from completing its replication, leading to its
death. These are just two examples of the six classes of chemotherapy drugs we use to
treat cancer today. But despite its huge benefits, chemotherapy has one big disadvantage:
it affects other healthy cells in the body that naturally have to renew rapidly. Hair
follicles, the cells of the mouth, the gastrointestinal lining, the reproductive system,
and bone marrow are hit nearly as hard as cancer. Similar to cancer cells, the rapid 
production of these normal cells means that they’re reaching for resources more
frequently— and are therefore more exposed to the effects of chemo drugs.

That leads to several common side effects of chemotherapy, including hair loss, fatigue,
infertility, nausea, and vomiting. Doctors commonly prescribe options to help manage
these side-effects, such as strong anti-nausea medications. For hair loss, devices called
cold caps can help lower the temperature around the head and constrict blood vessels,
limiting the amount of chemotherapy drugs that reach hair follicles. And once a course of
chemo treatment is over, the healthy tissues that’ve been badly affected by the drug
will recover and begin to renew as usual. In 2018 alone, over 17 million people world-wide
received a cancer diagnosis. But chemotherapy and other treatments have changed the
outlook for so many. Just take the fact that up to 95% of individuals with testicular
cancer survive it, thanks to advances in treatment. Even in people with acute myeloid 
leukemia— an aggressive blood cancer— chemotherapy puts an estimated 60% of patients
under 60 into remission following their first phase of treatment. Researchers are still
developing more precise interventions that only target the intended cancer
cells.

That’ll help improve survival rates while leaving healthy tissues with reduced harm,
making one of the best tools we have in the fight against cancer even
better.
