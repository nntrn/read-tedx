It is such a sort of instrumental part of our cooking vocabulary, in terms of the
utensils. And it was like, that's interesting, there are people who live without
chopsticks.[Small Thing.][Big Idea.]Chopsticks are a pair of two long sticks used to eat
things with one hand. Holding chopsticks is a little bit like holding a pencil, except
that you have two of them and you move them together in a pincer movement. Most of them
are made out of wood. They're also made out of plastic, bamboo, jade, gold, silver and
even ivory, though I think that's not so cool anymore. Chopsticks are really well designed
for eating small bits of food. They're good for picking up noodles. If you're skilled, you
can eat rice, pick up dumplings, pieces of meat. There are some no-nos with chopsticks. You
should not use the chopsticks like drumsticks, which I know is tempting. You don't want to
stick chopsticks into a bowl of rice face-up.

And the reason for that is it actually looks like a bowl of incense, so it sort of echoes
death. Chopsticks are used in a huge portion of the world, across much of Asia, about 1.5
billion people are covered in the chopsticks sphere. Different cultures have slightly
different variations of chopsticks. Chinese chopsticks will tend to be long and round,
Korean chopsticks are flatter and often made of metal and Japanese chopsticks tend to be
round and very, very pointy. While chopsticks are actually really commonplace in American
society today, there was definitely a time in the late 1800s where this idea that Asian
men, because they ate rice with sticks, were of a different quality than American men, who
ate proper meat with a knife and fork. But when China and the United States began their
diplomatic engagement in the 1970s, Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger, had to practice eating
with chopsticks.

What's been really interesting to see is that as Asian cuisine has moved from the East
into the West, chopsticks have become part of the experience. There's evidence of
chopsticks as long ago as the Shang dynasty, which is about 3000 years ago, and they loved
tripods during the Shang dynasty. So when you cook with these big tripods, chopsticks were
actually really useful, because it was a way for you to stir and to reach without getting
burned as the water was boiling in these really big pots. Chinese culture has knives and
has forks. It uses them in many cases for cooking. But in terms of like what moved into
the dining room, it was the chopsticks. One of the things about Asian cooking is that it
often comes in very small pieces. And I think part of that has to do with the fact that
it's actually a lot more energy-efficient to cook little pieces quickly. But also, then
you don't have to cut them.

So you have a circular influence, where the type of food that is cooked allows people to
use chopsticks, and then the fact that you have chopsticks influences the food that you
can cook. But at the same time, chopsticks reflect the communal nature of eating food.
You'll have these dishes that you put in the middle, it's very family style. You go in
with your chopsticks, and you put it on your rice, and then you eat individually. There's
actually a famous sort of legend where everyone has these really, really long chopsticks,
like way too long for them to feed themselves. And so in hell, everyone starves, because
they can't pick up food and put it in their mouths. But in heaven, people take the same
chopsticks and then feed each other.
