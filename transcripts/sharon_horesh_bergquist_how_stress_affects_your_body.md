title: How stress affects your body
speaker: Sharon Horesh Bergquist
description: >-
 Our hard-wired stress response is designed to give us the quick burst of
 heightened alertness and energy needed to perform our best. But stress isn't all
 good. When activated too long or too often, stress can damage virtually every
 part of our body. Sharon Horesh Bergquist gives us a look at what goes on inside
 our body when we are chronically stressed. [Directed by Adriatic Animation,
 narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Jure BuljeviÄ‡].

Cramming for a test? Trying to get more done than you have time to do? Stress is a feeling
we all experience when we are challenged or overwhelmed. But more than just an emotion,
stress is a hardwired physical response that travels throughout your entire body. In the
short term, stress can be advantageous, but when activated too often or too long, your
primitive fight or flight stress response not only changes your brain but also damages
many of the other organs and cells throughout your body. Your adrenal gland releases the
stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, and norepinephrine. As
these hormones travel through your blood stream, they easily reach your blood vessels
and heart. Adrenaline causes your heart to beat faster and raises your blood pressure,
over time causing hypertension. Cortisol can also cause the endothelium, or inner lining
of blood vessels, to not function normally.

Scientists now know that this is an early step in triggering the process of
atherosclerosis or cholesterol plaque build up in your arteries. Together, these changes
increase your chances of a heart attack or stroke. When your brain senses stress, it
activates your autonomic nervous system. Through this network of nerve connections, your
big brain communicates stress to your enteric, or intestinal nervous system. Besides
causing butterflies in your stomach, this brain-gut connection can disturb the natural
rhythmic contractions that move food through your gut, leading to irritable bowel
syndrome, and can increase your gut sensitivity to acid, making you more likely to feel
heartburn. Via the gut's nervous system, stress can also change the composition and
function of your gut bacteria, which may affect your digestive and overall health.
Speaking of digestion, does chronic stress affect your waistline? Well, yes. Cortisol can
increase your appetite.

It tells your body to replenish your energy stores with energy dense foods and carbs,
causing you to crave comfort foods. High levels of cortisol can also cause you to put on
those extra calories as visceral or deep belly fat. This type of fat doesn't just make it
harder to button your pants. It is an organ that actively releases hormones and immune
system chemicals called cytokines that can increase your risk of developing chronic
diseases, such as heart disease and insulin resistance. Meanwhile, stress hormones 
affect immune cells in a variety of ways. Initially, they help prepare to fight invaders
and heal after injury, but chronic stress can dampen function of some immune cells, make
you more susceptible to infections, and slow the rate you heal. Want to live a long life?
You may have to curb your chronic stress. That's because it has even been associated with
shortened telomeres, the shoelace tip ends of chromosomes that measure a cell's
age.

Telomeres cap chromosomes to allow DNA to get copied every time a cell divides without
damaging the cell's genetic code, and they shorten with each cell division. When
telomeres become too short, a cell can no longer divide and it dies. As if all that
weren't enough, chronic stress has even more ways it can sabotage your health, including
acne, hair loss, sexual dysfunction, headaches, muscle tension, difficulty concentrating,
fatigue, and irritability. So, what does all this mean for you? Your life will always be
filled with stressful situations. But what matters to your brain and entire body is how
you respond to that stress. If you can view those situations as challenges you can control
and master, rather than as threats that are insurmountable, you will perform better in
the short run and stay healthy in the long run.
