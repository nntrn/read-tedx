title: The forgotten art of the zoetrope
speaker: Eric Dyer
description: >-
 Artist Eric Dyer spent years working at a computer to produce images for the
 screen. Longing to get his hands back on his work, he began exploring the
 zoetrope, a popular 19th-century device that was used to create the illusion of
 motion long before the arrival of film. In this vibrant talk, he showcases his
 resulting art inventions: spinning sculptures and that evoke beautiful, dreamlike
 scenes. (Warning: This talk includes flashing images and lights. Those who are
 photosensitive or have seizures trigged by strobes are advised to avoid.)

A long time ago, I was a professional animator.

[Eric Dyer][Animator][Compositor]And at night, I would make my own experimental
films.

And I was spending a lot of time, way too much time, in front of a screen for work that
would be presented on a screen, and I had this great need to get my hands back on the work
again. Now, before "The Simpsons," before "Gumby," before "Betty Boop," before there was
such a thing as cinema and television, animation was hugely popular in this form. This is
a zoetrope. And you spin this drum, and you look through the slits into the inside of the
drum, and you see the animation pop to life. This is animation in physical form, and it's
animation I could get my hands on again. I took these ideas to Denmark. I went there with
my family on a Fulbright Fellowship. That's my daughter, Mia. I rode around the city on my
bicycle and shot all the interesting moving elements of Copenhagen: the boaters in the
canals, the colors that explode in spring, the free-use city bikes, love, textures, the
healthy cuisine —

And I brought all that video back into the physical world by printing it out on these long
strips of ink-jet paper and cutting out the forms. Now, I invented my own form of the
zoetrope, which removes the drum and replaces the slits with a video camera. And this was
very exciting for me, because it meant that I could make these physical objects, and I
could make films from those objects. That's me riding on my bicycle.

I made about 25 paper sculptures, each the size of a bicycle wheel. I brought them into
the studio, spun them and shot them to make the film "Copenhagen Cycles."

This project not only allowed me to get my hands back on the work again but it helped me
get my life back. Instead of spending 12, 15 hours a day with my face plastered to a
screen, I was having these little adventures with our new family and shooting video along
the way, and it was kind of a symbiosis of art and life. And I think that it's no mistake
that zoetrope translates into "wheel of life."

But film and video does flatten sculpture, so I tried to imagine a way that animated
sculpture could be experienced as such, and also a completely immersive kind of animated
sculpture. And that's where I came up with the idea for the zoetrope tunnel. You walk
through with a handheld strobe, and wherever you point the flashlight, the animation pops
to life. I plan to finish this project in the next 30 to 40 years.

But I did build a half-scale prototype. It's covered in Velcro, and I could lay inside on
this bridge and stick animated sequences to the walls and test stuff out. People would
comment that it reminded them of an MRI. And that medical connection spoke to me, because
at the age of 14, I was diagnosed with a degenerative retinal condition that's slowly
taking my vision away, and I'd never responded to that in my work. So I responded to it in
this piece called, "Implant." It is an imaginary, super-magnified medical device that fits
around the optic nerve. And the public is, in a sense, miniaturized to experience it. With
a handheld strobe, they can explore the sculpture, and discover thousands of cell-sized
robots hard at work, leaping in and out of the optic nerve, being deployed to the retina
to repair it. It's my science fiction fantasy cure of my own incurable disorder.(Machine

being administered to unhealthy cells using viruses.

There's a lot of colorful, fluffy hope in this, and there's also some creepy, threatening
idea of viruses maybe becoming an invasive species in your body. Vision loss has helped to
take me away from the things that disconnect me from the world. Instead of being sealed
off in an automobile, I ride my bike, take buses and trains and walk a lot. And instead of
a visually intensive process in the studio, primarily, I'm also getting outdoors a lot
more and using more of my senses. This landscape is a couple hours east of San Diego,
California. My brother lives out that way. He and I went camping there for four days. And
I grabbed my camera, and I walked through the canyons. And I tried to imagine and figure
out what kind of motion would be present in this place that was so still and so devoid of
motion. I think it's the stillest place I've ever been. And I realized that it was the
movement of my own body through the landscape that was creating the animation.

It was the motion of changing perspective. So I created this piece called "Mud Caves" from
those photographs. It's a multilayered print piece, and you can think of it as a zoetrope
laid flat. It's kind of my western landscape panorama. And next to the print piece there's
a video monitor that shows the animation hidden within the artwork. I think one of the
best parts about this project for me was that I got to hang out with my brother a lot, who
lives 2,500 miles away from me. And we would just sit in this seemingly eternal landscape
sculpted by water over millions of years and talk. We'd talk about our kids growing up and
the slowing pace of our parents, and our dad who's suffering from leukemia, memory loss
and infection. And it struck me that, as individuals, we're finite, but as a family, we
are an ongoing cycle — a kind of wheel of life. Now, I want to leave you with a tribute to
one of my mentors.

She reminds me that physical presence is important and that play is not a luxury, but a
necessity. She's Pixie, and she's our family dog. And she loves to jump.(Dog barking)(Dog

Imaging Research Center at UMBC in Baltimore. And I call it a "real-time zoetrope."(Dog
