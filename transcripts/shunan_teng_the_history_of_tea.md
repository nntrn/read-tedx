During a long day spent roaming the forest in search of edible grains and herbs, the weary
divine farmer Shennong accidentally poisoned himself 72 times. But before the poisons
could end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth. He chewed on it and it revived him, and
that is how we discovered tea. Or so an ancient legend goes at least. Tea doesn't actually
cure poisonings, but the story of Shennong, the mythical Chinese inventor of agriculture,
highlights tea's importance to ancient China. Archaeological evidence suggests tea was
first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs
built the Great Pyramids of Giza. That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that's
grown around the world today, yet it was originally consumed very differently. It was
eaten as a vegetable or cooked with grain porridge. Tea only shifted from food to drink
1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination of heat and moisture could create
a complex and varied taste out of the leafy green.

After hundreds of years of variations to the preparation method, the standard became to
heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, mix with hot water, and
create a beverage called muo cha, or matcha. Matcha became so popular that a distinct
Chinese tea culture emerged. Tea was the subject of books and poetry, the favorite drink
of emperors, and a medium for artists. They would draw extravagant pictures in the foam of
the tea, very much like the espresso art you might see in coffee shops today. In the 9th
century during the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought the first tea plant to Japan.
The Japanese eventually developed their own unique rituals around tea, leading to the
creation of the Japanese tea ceremony. And in the 14th century during the Ming Dynasty,
the Chinese emperor shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes to loose leaf tea.
At that point, China still held a virtual monopoly on the world's tea trees, making tea
one of three essential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and
silk.

This gave China a great deal of power and economic influence as tea drinking spread around
the world. That spread began in earnest around the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought
tea to Europe in large quantities. Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza, a Portuguese
noble woman, for making tea popular with the English aristocracy when she married King
Charles II in 1661. At the time, Great Britain was in the midst of expanding its colonial
influence and becoming the new dominant world power. And as Great Britain grew, interest
in tea spread around the world. By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times the price of
coffee and the plant was still only grown in China. The tea trade was so lucrative that
the world's fastest sailboat, the clipper ship, was born out of intense competition
between Western trading companies. All were racing to bring their tea back to Europe first
to maximize their profits. At first, Britain paid for all this Chinese tea with
silver.

When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea for another substance, opium.
This triggered a public health problem within China as people became addicted to the drug.
Then in 1839, a Chinese official ordered his men to destroy massive British shipments of
opium as a statement against Britain's influence over China. This act triggered the First
Opium War between the two nations. Fighting raged up and down the Chinese coast until
1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded the port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed
trading on unfavorable terms. The war weakened China's global standing for over a century.
The British East India company also wanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further
control the market. So they commissioned botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China 
in a covert operation. He disguised himself and took a perilous journey through China's
mountainous tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees and experienced tea workers into
Darjeeling, India.

From there, the plant spread further still, helping drive tea's rapid growth as an
everyday commodity. Today, tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world after
water, and from sugary Turkish Rize tea, to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as
many ways of preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe.
