title: "Stumbling towards intimacy": An improvised TED Talk
speaker: Anthony Veneziale
description: >-
 In a hilarious, completely improvised talk, improv master Anthony Veneziale takes
 to the TED stage for a truly one-of-a-kind performance. Armed with an audience-suggested
 topic ("stumbling towards intimacy") and a deck of slides he's never seen before,
 Veneziale crafts a meditation on the intersection of love, language and ...

is an — incredibly —

Is an incredibly experienced linguist working at a lab at MIT with a small group of
researchers, and through studying our language and the way that we communicate with other
people, he has stumbled upon the secret of human intimacy. Here to give us his
perspective, please welcome to the stage, Anthony Veneziale.

Anthony Veneziale: You might think I know what you're going through. You might be looking
at me here on the red dot, or you might be looking at me on the screen. There's a one
sixth of a second delay. Did I catch myself? I did. I could see myself before I turned,
and that small delay creates a little bit of a divide.

And a divide is exactly what happens with human language, and the processing of that
language. I of course am working out of a small lab at MIT.

And we are scraping for every insight that we can get.

This is not often associated with a computational challenge, but in this case, we found
that persistence of vision and auditory intake actually have more in common than we ever
realized, and we can see it in this first slide.

Immediately your processing goes to, "Is that a hard-boiled egg?"

"Is that perhaps the structural integrity of the egg being able to sustain the weight of
what seems to be a rock? Aha, is it in fact a real rock?" We go to questions when we see
visual information. But when we hear information, this is what happens.

The floodgates in our mind open much like the streets of Shanghai.

So many pieces of information to process, so many ideas, concepts, feelings and, of
course, vulnerabilities that we don't often wish to share. And so we hide, and we hide
behind what we like to call the floodgate of intimacy.

And what might that floodgate be holding? What is the dike upon which it is built? Well,
first off —

we found that it's different for six different genotypes.

And, of course, we can start categorizing these genotypes into a neuronormative experience
and a neurodiverse experience.

On the right-hand side of the screen, you're seeing spikes for the neurodiverse thinking.
Now, there are generally only two emotional states that a neurodiverse brain can tabulate
and keep count of at any given time, thereby eliminating the possibility for them to be
emotionally, sometimes, attuned to the present situation. But on the left-hand side, you
can see the neuronormative brain, which can often handle about five different pieces of
emotional cognitive information at any given time. These are the slight variances that you
are seeing in the 75, 90 and 60 percentile, and then of course that dramatic difference of
the 25, 40 and 35 percentile.

But of course, what is the neural network that is helping to bridge and build these
different discrepancies?

Fear.

And as we all know, fear resides in the amygdala, and it is a very natural response, and
it is very closely linked with visual perception. It is not as closely linked with verbal
perception, so our fear receptors often will be going off in advance of any of our
cognitive usage around verbal and words and cues of language. So as we see these fear
moments, we of course are taken aback. We stumble in a certain direction, generally away
from the intimacy.

Now of course, there's a difference between the male perception and the female perception
and of trans and those who are in between, all of those as well, and outside of the gender
spectrum.

But fear is the central underlying underpinning of all of our response systems.
Fight-or-flight is one of the earliest, some say reptilian, response to our
environment. How can we disengage or unhook ourselves from the horns of the
amygdala?

Well, I'd like to tell you the secret right now.

This is all making much, much too much sense.

The secret lies in turning our backs to one another, and I know that that sounds
absolutely like the opposite of what you were expecting, but when in a relationship you
turn your back to your partner and place your back upon their back —

you eliminate visual cues.

You are more readily available to failing first, and failing first —

far outweighs the lengths we go to to appeal to others, to our partners and to ourselves.
We spend billions and billions of dollars on clothing, on makeup, on the latest trend of
glasses, but what we don't spend money and time on is connecting with each other in a way
that is truthful and honest and stripped of those visual receptors.

It sounds hard, doesn't it?

But we want to be aggressive about this. We don't want to just sit on the couch. As a
historian said earlier today, it's important to get up and circumvent sometimes that
couch. And how can we do it? Well yes, ice is a big part of it. Insights, compassion and
empathy: I, C, E.

And when we start using this ice method, well, the possibilities become much bigger than
us. In fact, they become smaller than you. On a molecular level, I believe that that
insight is the unifying theme for every talk you have seen so far at TED and will continue
as we of course embark on this journey here on this tiny planet, on the ledge, on the
precipice, as we are seeing, yes, death is inevitable.

Will it meet all of us at the same time, I think, is the variable we are
inquiring.

I think that timeline gets a bit longer when we use ice and when we rest our backs upon
one another and build together, leaving behind the fear and working towards
—

they'll edit this part out —

a ripened experience of love, compassion, intimacy based on a truth that you are sharing
from your mind's eye and the heart that we all can touch, tactilely feel, have maybe
potentially a mushy experience that we don't just throw out because it is browned, but let
us slice in half the experience we have gathered, let us seed what the heart, the core,
the seed of that idea in each of us is, and let us share it back to back. Thank you very
much.
