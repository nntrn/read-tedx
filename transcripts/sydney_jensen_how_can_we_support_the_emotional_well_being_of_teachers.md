title: How can we support the emotional well-being of teachers?
speaker: Sydney Jensen
description: >-
 Teachers emotionally support our kids -- but who's supporting our teachers? In
 this eye-opening talk, educator Sydney Jensen explores how teachers are at risk
 of "secondary trauma" -- the idea that they absorb the emotional weight of their
 students' experiences -- and shows how schools can get creative in supporting
 everyone's mental health and wellness.

Like many teachers, every year on the first day of school, I lead a sort of icebreaker
activity with my students. I teach at Lincoln High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, and we are
one of the oldest and most diverse high schools in our state. Also, to our knowledge,
we're the only high school in the world whose mascot is the Links. Like, a
chain.

And with that being our mascot, we have a statue out front of our building of four links
connected like a chain. And each link means something. Our links stand for tradition,
excellence, unity and diversity. So on the first day of school, I teach my new
ninth-graders about the meaning behind those links, and I give them each a slip of paper.
On that paper, I ask them to write something about themselves. It can be something that
they love, something that they hope for — anything that describes their identity. And then
I go around the room with a stapler, and I staple each of those slips together to make a
chain. And we hang that chain up in our classroom as a decoration, sure, but also as a
reminder that we are all connected. We are all links. So what happens when one of those
links feels weak? And what happens when that weakness is in the person holding the
stapler? The person who's supposed to make those connections.

The teacher. As teachers, we work every day to provide support socially, emotionally and
academically to our students who come to us with diverse and tough circumstances. Like
most teachers, I have students who go home every day, and they sit around the kitchen
table while one or both parents makes a healthy, well-rounded meal for them. They spend
suppertime summarizing the story they read in ninth-grade English that day, or explaining
how Newton's laws of motion work. But I also have students who go to the homeless shelter
or to the group home. They go to the car that their family is sleeping in right now. They
come to school with trauma, and when I go home every day, that goes home with me. And see,
that's the hard part about teaching. It's not the grading, the lesson-planning, the
meetings, though sure, those things do occupy a great deal of teachers' time and energy.
The tough part about teaching is all the things you can't control for your kids, all the
things you can't change for them once they walk out your door.

And so I wonder if it's always been this way. I think back to my undergraduate training at
the University of Georgia, where we were taught in our methods classes that the concept of
good teaching has changed. We're not developing learners who are going to go out into a
workforce where they'll stand on a line in a factory. Rather, we're sending our kids out
into a workforce where they need to be able to communicate, collaborate and problem-solve.
And that has caused teacher-student relationships to morph into something stronger than
the giver of content and the receiver of knowledge. Lectures and sitting in silent rows
just doesn't cut it anymore. We have to be able to build relationships with and among our
students to help them feel connected in a world that depends on it. I think back to my
second year teaching. I had a student who I'll call "David." And I remember feeling like
I'd done a pretty good job at teaching that year: "Hey, I ain't no first-year
teacher.

I know what I'm doing." And it was on the last day of school, I told David to have a great
summer. And I watched him walk down the hall, and I thought to myself, I don't even know
what his voice sounds like. And that's when I realized I wasn't doing it right. So I
changed almost everything about my teaching. I built in plenty of opportunities for my
students to talk to me and to talk to each other, to share their writing and to verbalize
their learning. And it was through those conversations I began not only to know their
voice but to know their pain. I had David in class again that next year, and I learned that
his father was undocumented and had been deported. He started acting out in school because
all he wanted was for his family to be together again. In so many ways, I felt his pain.
And I needed someone to listen, somebody to provide support for me so that I could support
him in this thing that I could not even comprehend. And we recognize that need for police
officers who've witnessed a gruesome crime scene and nurses who have lost a
patient.

But when it comes to teaching professionals, that urgency is lagging. I believe it's
paramount that students and teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals and all other
support staff have convenient and affordable access to mental wellness supports. When we
are constantly serving others, often between 25 and 125 students each day, our emotional
piggy banks are constantly being drawn upon. After a while, it can become so depleted,
that we just can't bear it anymore. They call it "secondary trauma" and "compassion
fatigue," the concept that we absorb the traumas our students share with us each day. And
after a while, our souls become weighed down by the heaviness of it all. The Buffett
Institute at the University of Nebraska recently found that most teachers — 86 percent
across early childhood settings — experienced some depressive symptoms during the prior
week. They found that approximately one in 10 reported clinically significant depressive
symptoms.

My interactions with colleagues and my own experiences make me feel like this is a
universal struggle across all grade levels. So what are we missing? What are we allowing
to break the chain and how do we repair it? In my career, I've experienced the death by
suicide of two students and one amazing teacher who loved his kids; countless students
experiencing homelessness; and kids entering and exiting the justice system. When these
events happen, protocol is to say, "If you need someone to talk to, then ..." And I say
that's not enough. I am so lucky. I work in an amazing school with great leadership. I
serve a large district with so many healthy partnerships with community agencies. They
have provided steadily increasing numbers of school counselors and therapists and support
staff to help our students. They even provide staff members with access to free counseling
as part of our employment plan.

But many small districts and even some large ones simply cannot foot the bill without
aid.

Not only does every school need social and emotional support staff, trained professionals
who can navigate the needs of the building — not just the students, not just the teachers,
but both — we also need these trained professionals to intentionally seek out those
closest to the trauma and check in with them. Many schools are doing what they can to fill
in the gaps, starting with acknowledging that the work that we do is downright
hard. Another school in Lincoln, Schoo Middle School, has what they call "Wellness
Wednesdays." They invite in community yoga teachers, they sponsor walks around the
neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant to bring people
together. Zachary Elementary School in Zachary, Louisiana, has something they call a
"Midweek Meetup," where they invite teachers to share lunch and to talk about the things
that are going well and the things that are weighing heavy on their hearts. These schools
are making space for conversations that matter.

Finally, my friend and colleague Jen Highstreet takes five minutes out of each day to
write an encouraging note to a colleague, letting them know that she sees their hard work
and the heart that they share with others. She knows that those five minutes can have an
invaluable and powerful ripple effect across our school. The chain that hangs in my
classroom is more than just a decoration. Those links hang over our heads for the entire
four years that our students walk our halls. And every year, I have seniors come back to
my classroom, room 340, and they can still point out where their link hangs. They remember
what they wrote on it. They feel connected and supported. And they have hope. Isn't that
what we all need? Somebody to reach out and make sure that we're OK. To check in with us
and remind us that we are a link. Every now and then, we all just need a little help
holding the stapler. Thank you.
