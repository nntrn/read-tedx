In 1884, a patient’s luck seemed to go from bad to worse. This patient had a rapidly
growing cancer in his neck, and then came down with an unrelated bacterial skin
infection. But soon, something unexpected happened: as he recovered from the infection, 
the cancer also began to recede. When a physician named William Coley tracked the patient
down 7 years later, no visible signs of the cancer remained. Coley believed something
remarkable was happening: that the bacterial infection had stimulated the patient’s
immune system to fight off the cancer. Coley’s fortunate discovery led him to pioneer the
intentional injection of bacteria to successfully treat cancer. Over a century later,
synthetic biologists have found an even better way to use these once unlikely allies— by
programming them to safely deliver drugs directly to tumors. Cancer occurs when normal
functions of cells are altered, causing them to rapidly multiply and form growths called
tumors.

Treatments like radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy attempt to kill malignant
cells, but can affect the entire body and disrupt healthy tissues in the
process. However, some bacteria like E. coli have the unique advantage of being able to
selectively grow inside tumors. In fact, the core of a tumor forms an ideal environment
where they can safely multiply, hidden from immune cells. Instead of causing infection,
bacteria can be reprogrammed to carry cancer-fighting drugs, acting as Trojan Horses 
that target the tumor from within. This idea of programming bacteria to sense and respond
in novel ways is a major focus of a field called Synthetic Biology. But how can bacteria
be programmed? The key lies in manipulating their DNA. By inserting particular genetic
sequences into bacteria, they can be instructed to synthesize different molecules,
including those that disrupt cancer growth.

They can also be made to behave in very specific ways with the help of biological
circuits. These program different behaviors depending on the presence, absence, or
combination of certain factors. For example, tumors have low oxygen and pH levels and
over-produce specific molecules. Synthetic biologists can program bacteria to sense those
conditions, and by doing so, respond to tumors while avoiding healthy tissue. One type of
biological circuit, known as a synchronized lysis circuit, or SLC, allows bacteria to
not only deliver medicine, but to do so on a set schedule. First, to avoid harming healthy
tissue, production of anti-cancer drugs begins as bacteria grow, which only happens 
within the tumor itself. Next, after they’ve produced the drugs, a kill-switch causes the
bacteria to burst when they reach a critical population threshold. This both releases the
medicine and decreases the bacteria’s population.

However, a certain percentage of the bacteria remain alive to replenish the colony.
Eventually their numbers grow large enough to trigger the kill switch again, and the cycle
continues. This circuit can be fine-tuned to deliver drugs on whatever periodic schedule
is best to fight the cancer. This approach has proven promising in scientific trials using
mice. Not only were scientists able to successfully eliminate lymphoma tumors injected
with bacteria, but the injection also stimulated the immune system, priming immune cells 
to identify and attack untreated lymphomas elsewhere in the mouse. Unlike many other
therapies, bacteria don’t target a specific type of cancer, but rather the general
characteristics shared by all solid tumors. Nor are programmable bacteria limited to
simply fighting cancer. Instead, they can serve as sophisticated sensors that monitor
sites of future disease.

Safe probiotic bacteria could perhaps lie dormant within our guts, where they’d detect,
prevent, and treat disorders before they have the chance to cause symptoms. Advances in
technology have created excitement around a future of personalized medicine driven by
mechanical nanobots. But thanks to billions of years of evolution we may already have a
starting point in the unexpectedly biological form of bacteria. Add synthetic biology to
the mix, and who knows what might soon be possible.
