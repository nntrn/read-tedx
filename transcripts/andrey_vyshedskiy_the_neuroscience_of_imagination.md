 Imagine, for a second, a duck teaching a French class. A ping-pong match in orbit
 around a black hole. A dolphin balancing a pineapple. You probably haven't
 actually seen any of these things. But you could imagine them instantly. How does
 your brain produce an image of something you've never seen? Andrey Vyshedskiy

Imagine, for a second, a duck teaching a French class, a ping-pong match in orbit around
a black hole, a dolphin balancing a pineapple. You probably haven't actually seen any of
these things, but you could imagine them instantly. How does your brain produce an image
of something you've never seen? That may not seem hard, but that's only because we're so
used to doing it. It turns out that this is actually a complex problem that requires
sophisticated coordination inside your brain. That's because to create these new, weird
images, your brain takes familiar pieces and assembles them in new ways, like a collage
made from fragments of photos. The brain has to juggle a sea of thousands of electrical
signals getting them all to their destination at precisely the right time. When you look
at an object, thousands of neurons in your posterior cortex fire. These neurons encode
various characteristics of the object: spiky, fruit, brown, green, and
yellow.

This synchronous firing strengthens the connections between that set of neurons, linking
them together into what's known as a neuronal ensemble, in this case the one for
pineapple. In neuroscience, this is called the Hebbian principle, neurons that fire
together wire together. If you try to imagine a pineapple later, the whole ensemble will
light up, assembling a complete mental image. Dolphins are encoded by a different neuronal
ensemble. In fact, every object that you've seen is encoded by a neuronal ensemble 
associated with it, the neurons wired together by that synchronized firing. But this
principle doesn't explain the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our
imaginations without ever seeing them. The neuronal ensemble for a dolphin balancing a
pineapple doesn't exist. So how come you can imagine it anyway? One hypothesis, called
the Mental Synthesis Theory, says that, again, timing is key.

If the neuronal ensembles for the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time,
we can perceive the two separate objects as a single image. But something in your brain 
has to coordinate that firing. One plausible candidate is the prefrontal cortex, which is
involved in all complex cognitive functions. Prefrontal cortex neurons are connected to
the posterior cortex by long, spindly cell extensions called neural fibers. The mental
synthesis theory proposes that like a puppeteer pulling the strings, the prefrontal cortex
neurons send electrical signals down these neural fibers to multiple ensembles in the
posterior cortex. This activates them in unison. If the neuronal ensembles are turned on
at the same time, you experience the composite image just as if you'd actually seen it.
This conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles by the
prefrontal cortex is called mental synthesis.

In order for mental sythesis to work, signals would have to arrive at both neuronal
ensembles at the same time. The problem is that some neurons are much farther away from
the prefrontal cortex than others. If the signals travel down both fibers at the same
rate, they'd arrive out of sync. You can't change the length of the connections, but your
brain, especially as it develops in childhood, does have a way to change the conduction
velocity. Neural fibers are wrapped in a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin is an
insulator and speeds up the electrical signals zipping down the nerve fiber. Some neural
fibers have as many as 100 layers of myelin. Others only have a few. And fibers with
thicker layers of myelin can conduct signals 100 times faster or more than those with
thinner ones. Some scientists now think that this difference in myelination could be the
key to uniform conduction time in the brain, and consequently, to our mental synthesis
ability.

A lot of this myelination happens in childhood, so from an early age, our vibrant
imaginations may have a lot to do with building up brains whose carefully myelinated
connections can craft creative symphonies throughout our lives.
