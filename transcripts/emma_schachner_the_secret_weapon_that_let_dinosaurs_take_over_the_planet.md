 We've all heard the theories on why the dinosaurs died -- but how did they come
 to dominate the earth for so long in the first place? (Hint: it has nothing to do

We've all heard about how the dinosaurs died. The story I'm going to tell you happened
over 200 million years before the dinosaurs went extinct. This story starts at the very
beginning, when dinosaurs were just getting their start. One of the biggest mysteries in
evolutionary biology is why dinosaurs were so successful. What led to their global
dominance for so many years? When people think about why dinosaurs were so amazing, they
usually think about the biggest or the smallest dinosaur, or who was the fastest, or who
had the most feathers, the most ridiculous armor, spikes or teeth. But perhaps the answer
had to do with their internal anatomy — a secret weapon, so to speak. My colleagues and I,
we think it was their lungs. I am both a paleontologist and a comparative anatomist, and I
am interested in understanding how the specialized dinosaur lung helped them take over the
planet. So we are going to jump back over 200 million years to the Triassic
period.

The environment was extremely harsh, there were no flowering plants, so this means that
there was no grass. So imagine a landscape filled with all pine trees and ferns. At the
same time, there were small lizards, mammals, insects, and there were also carnivorous and
herbivorous reptiles — all competing for the same resources. Critical to this story is that
oxygen levels have been estimated to have been as low as 15 percent, compared to today's
21 percent. So it would have been crucial for dinosaurs to be able to breathe in this
low-oxygen environment, not only to survive but to thrive and to diversify. So, how do we
know what dinosaur lungs were even like, since all that remains of a dinosaur generally is
its fossilized skeleton? The method that we use is called "extant phylogenetic
bracketing." This is a fancy way of saying that we study the anatomy — specifically in
this case, the lungs and skeleton — of the living descendants of dinosaurs on the
evolutionary tree.

So we would look at the anatomy of birds, who are the direct descendants of dinosaurs, and
we'd look at the anatomy of crocodilians, who are their closest living relatives, and then
we would look at the anatomy of lizards and turtles, who we can think of like their
cousins. And then we apply these anatomical data to the fossil record, and then we can use
that to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs. And in this specific instance, the skeleton of
dinosaurs most closely resembles that of modern birds. So, because dinosaurs were competing
with early mammals during this time period, it's important to understand the basic
blueprint of the mammalian lung. Also, to reintroduce you to lungs in general, we will use
my dog Mila of Troy, the face that launched a thousand treats, as our model.

This story takes place inside of a chest cavity. So I want you to visualize the ribcage of
a dog. Think about how the spinal vertebral column is completely horizontal to the ground.
This is how the spinal vertebral column is going to be in all of the animals that we'll be
talking about, whether they walked on two legs or four legs. Now I want you to climb inside
of the imaginary ribcage and look up. This is our thoracic ceiling. This is where the top
surface of the lungs comes into direct contact with the ribs and vertebrae. This interface
is where our story takes place. Now I want you to visualize the lungs of a dog. On the
outside, it's like a giant inflatable bag where all parts of the bag expand during
inhalation and contract during exhalation. Inside of the bag, there's a series of
branching tubes, and these tubes are called the bronchial tree. These tubes deliver the
inhaled oxygen to, ultimately, the alveolus.

They cross over a thin membrane into the bloodstream by diffusion. Now, this part is
critical. The entire mammalian lung is mobile. That means it's moving during the entire
respiratory process, so that thin membrane, the blood-gas barrier, cannot be too thin or
it will break. Now, remember the blood-gas barrier, because we will be returning to
this. So, you're still with me? Because we're going to start birds and it gets crazy, so
hold on to your butts. 

The bird is completely different from the mammal. And we are going to be using birds as
our model to reconstruct the lungs of dinosaurs. So in the bird, air passes through the
lung, but the lung does not expand or contract. The lung is immobilized, it has the
texture of a dense sponge and it's inflexible and locked into place on the top and sides
by the ribcage and on the bottom by a horizontal membrane. It is then unidirectionally
ventilated by a series of flexible, bag-like structures that branch off of the bronchial
tree, beyond the lung itself, and these are called air sacs. Now, this entire extremely
delicate setup is locked into place by a series of forked ribs all along the thoracic
ceiling. Also, in many species of birds, extensions arise from the lung and the air sacs,
they invade the skeletal tissues — usually the vertebrae, sometimes the ribs — and they
lock the respiratory system into place.

And this is called "vertebral pneumaticity." The forked ribs and the vertebral
pneumaticity are two clues that we can hunt for in the fossil record, because these two
skeletal traits would indicate that regions of the respiratory system of dinosaurs are
immobilized. This anchoring of the respiratory system facilitated the evolution of the
thinning of the blood-gas barrier, that thin membrane over which oxygen was diffusing into
the bloodstream. The immobility permits this because a thin barrier is a weak barrier, and
the weak barrier would rupture if it was actively being ventilated like a mammalian
lung. So why do we care about this? Why does this even matter? Oxygen more easily diffuses
across a thin membrane, and a thin membrane is one way of enhancing respiration under
low-oxygen conditions — low-oxygen conditions like that of the Triassic period. So, if
dinosaurs did indeed have this type of lung, they'd be better equipped to breathe than all
other animals, including mammals. So do you remember the extant phylogenetic bracket method
where we take the anatomy of modern animals, and we apply that to the fossil
record?

So, clue number one was the forked ribs of modern birds. Well, we find that in pretty much
the majority of dinosaurs. So that means that the top surface of the lungs of dinosaurs
would be locked into place, just like modern birds. Clue number two is vertebral
pneumaticity. We find this in sauropod dinosaurs and theropod dinosaurs, which is the
group that contains predatory dinosaurs and gave rise to modern birds. And while we don't
find evidence of fossilized lung tissue in dinosaurs, vertebral pneumaticity gives us
evidence of what the lung was doing during the life of these animals. Lung tissue or air
sac tissue was invading the vertebrae, hollowing them out just like a modern bird, and
locking regions of the respiratory system into place, immobilizing them. The forked ribs
and the vertebral pneumaticity together were creating an immobilized, rigid framework that
locked the respiratory system into place that permitted the evolution of that superthin,
superdelicate blood-gas barrier that we see today in modern birds. Evidence of this
straightjacketed lung in dinosaurs means that they had the capability to evolve a lung
that would have been able to breathe under the hypoxic, or low-oxygen, atmosphere of the
Triassic period.

This rigid skeletal setup in dinosaurs would have given them a significant adaptive
advantage over other animals, particularly mammals, whose flexible lung couldn't have
adapted to the hypoxic, or low-oxygen, atmosphere of the Triassic. This anatomy may have
been the secret weapon of dinosaurs that gave them that advantage over other animals. And
this gives us an excellent launchpad to start testing the hypotheses of dinosaurian
diversification. This is the story of the dinosaurs' beginning, and it's just the beginning
of the story of our research into this subject. Thank you.
