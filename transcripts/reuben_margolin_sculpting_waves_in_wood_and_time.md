title: Sculpting waves in wood and time
speaker: Reuben Margolin
description: >-
 Reuben Margolin is a kinetic sculptor, crafting beautiful pieces that move in the
 pattern of raindrops falling and waves combining. Take nine minutes and be
 mesmerized by his meditative art -- inspired in equal parts by math and
 nature.

Usually I like working in my shop, but when it's raining and the driveway outside turns
into a river, then I just love it. And I'll cut some wood and drill some holes and watch
the water, and maybe I'll have to walk around and look for washers. You have no idea how
much time I spend. This is the "Double Raindrop." Of all my sculptures, it's the most
talkative. It adds together the interference pattern from two raindrops that land near
each other. Instead of expanding circles, they're expanding hexagons. All the sculptures
move by mechanical means. Do you see how there's three peaks to the yellow sine wave?
Right here I'm adding a sine wave with four peaks and turning it on. Eight hundred
two-liter soda bottles — oh yea. 

Four hundred aluminum cans. Tule is a reed that's native to California, and the best thing
about working with it is that it smells just delicious. A single drop of rain increasing
amplitude. The spiral eddy that trails a paddle on a rafting trip. This adds together four
different waves. And here I'm going to pull out the double wavelengths and increase the
single. The mechanism that drives it has nine motors and about 3,000 pulleys. Four hundred
and forty-five strings in a three-dimensional weave. Transferred to a larger scale —
actually a lot larger, with a lot of help — 14,064 bicycle reflectors — a 20-day
install."Connected" is a collaboration with choreographer Gideon Obarzanek. Strings
attached to dancers. This is very early rehearsal footage, but the finished work's on tour
and is actually coming through L.A. in a couple weeks. A pair of helices and 40 wooden
slats. Take your finger and draw this line. Summer, fall, winter, spring, noon, dusk,
dark, dawn.

Have you ever seen those stratus clouds that go in parallel stripes across the sky? Did
you know that's a continuous sheet of cloud that's dipping in and out of the condensation
layer? What if every seemingly isolated object was actually just where the continuous wave
of that object poked through into our world? The Earth is neither flat nor round. It's
wavy. It sounds good, but I'll bet you know in your gut that it's not the whole truth, and
I'll tell you why. I have a two-year-old daughter who's the best thing ever. And I'm just
going to come out and say it: My daughter is not a wave. And you might say, "Surely,
Rueben, if you took even just the slightest step back, the cycles of hunger and eating,
waking and sleeping, laughing and crying would emerge as pattern." But I would say, "If I
did that, too much would be lost."This tension between the need to look deeper and the
beauty and immediacy of the world, where if you even try to look deeper you've already
missed what you're looking for, this tension is what makes the sculptures
move.

And for me, the path between these two extremes takes the shape of a wave. Let me show you
one more. Thank you very much. Thanks. 

Thanks.

June Cohen: Looking at each of your sculptures, they evoke so many different images. Some
of them are like the wind and some are like waves, and sometimes they look alive and
sometimes they seem like math. Is there an actual inspiration behind each one? Are you
thinking of something physical or somthing tangible as you design it? RM: Well some of them
definitely have a direct observation — like literally two raindrops falling, and just
watching that pattern is so stunning. And then just trying to figure out how to make that
using stuff. I like working with my hands. There's nothing better than cutting a piece of
wood and trying to make it move. JC: And does it ever change? Do you think you're designing
one thing, and then when it's produced it looks like something else? RM: The "Double
Raindrop" I worked on for nine months, and when I finally turned it on, I actually hated
it. The very moment I turned it on, I hated it.

It was like a really deep-down gut reaction, and I wanted to throw it out. And I happened
to have a friend who was over, and he said, "Why don't you just wait." And I waited, and
the next day I liked it a bit better, the next day I liked it a bit better, and now I
really love it. And so I guess, one, the gut reactions a little bit wrong sometimes, and
two, it does not look like as expected. JC: The relationship evolves over time. Well thank
you so much. That was a gorgeous treat for us. RM: Thanks. (JC: Thank you,
Reuben.)
