So on May 6 of 2019, the sun was shining, the sky was blue, clouds were that puffy white.
It was a perfect spring day. I was walking back to my office, and my phone rang. And it was
one of my lieutenants. I said, "Hey, John. How are you?" He said, "Sir, I'm good. But I've
got some bad news." He said our executive officer died that weekend. We went back and
forth, "What do you mean, what are you talking about?" I asked him what happened. He said,
"Sir, he killed himself."I walked around my office for a couple of hours in a complete
fog, trying to understand what had happened, why. I had just communicated with him a few
months earlier. And I had no idea that this officer was in trouble. And I fault myself as
a leader for not having known that. I went on this process of trying to figure out why,
what's happening in the veteran community, why are these things going on. I read reports
from the Department of Veteran Affairs, Department of Defense, I've read national studies
on mental health and the issues associated with it.

I'm going to share with you some of the things I found out. Department of Veteran Affairs
has taken the lead on veteran suicide, and it's actually their number one priority. Based
on the reports they have and the numbers that I've calculated, between 2001 and 2019,
during the time of the Global War on Terror, my approximation is there's 115,000 veterans
who have died by their own hands. I also looked at the Department of Defense report that
lists casualties. This particular report lists the casualties from October of 2001
specifically to November 18 of last year. During that time frame and the Global War on
Terror, there have been 5,440 active duty members killed in action. So by my numbers,
115,000 approximate suicides, 5,440 killed in action. What does that mean to me? We have
approximately 21 veterans ending their lives by their own hand for every one that is
killed by an enemy combatant.

It's a staggering, staggering number. These national studies that deal with mental health
tell us that if you have any type of genetic mental health issue within your family that
can be passed on, or if something has happened to you in your childhood that was
traumatic, your ability to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD,
significantly decreases. They also tell us that if you want to have a full evaluation,
determine if somebody has PTSD, you need to have a minimum of one hour interview with a
mental health expert that's trained to detect what PTSD is to determine if you suffer from
it. Now let me talk about what happens when you enter into the military. When you join the
armed forces, you're going to go through a medical exam, you're going to take a physical
fitness test, you're going to take a drug test, you're going to take a vocational test so
they can figure out what you're good at and hopefully place you in that type of job
category.

But would you believe that with approximately 115,000 suicides over the last 20 years, and
the data that we know from the national studies on how to determine if somebody is going
to be able to cope with post-traumatic stress disorder, we still don't have a standardized
mental health evaluation for our recruits entering into the service. That's something I
think that needs to change. Number two, when you leave the service — When I left the
service in 2003, I had to attend some mandatory classes, about two days' worth of classes,
and then I was on my way. Today, it's a little different. Today you'll actually get a call
if you're on what we call terminal leave or paid time off that you're trying to use up
before you actually are fully discharged. I talked to one veteran who got a call. He was
on his way home from work, and the only thing he could think of was, "How quick can I get
off this?" And I think the call lasted maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

But yet the national studies tell us it needs to be an in-person, one-hour interview. I
think that's something that we can improve upon. There's another thing that the Department
of Veteran Affairs talked about in the reports. They said that our service members that
are self-medicating tend to be at a significantly higher risk of suicide. So those
veterans that are self-medicating with alcohol, or drug abuse — and in fact, the
Department of Veteran Affairs has classified opioid use disorder, OUD, as one of the
epidemics. So as I talked to marines from my unit and tried to learn more about it, I
started to find out some really, really alarming things. I had a marine who came back from
Iraq and he went to the hospital for a "back pain" and he was prescribed some opioids. He
also suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. He became addicted to these
painkillers, because not only did it mask the pain in his back, but it helped him to cope
with some of the horrific things that he had to see, experience and do over in the Middle
East.

And he eventually overdosed. Another challenge we have is that when you're on active duty,
you are under the Department of Defense. And so all of your doctors, all your health care
is in that category. When you leave the service, you are now part of the Department of
Veteran Affairs. So these active duty members that seek help for their mental health
issues and are diagnosed with PTSD or other mental health issues, when they leave the
service, there's no transition to a doctor that's in the Department of Veteran Affairs or
perhaps out in the civilian world because of privacy acts. Now there's some good news in
this. Just recently, it was legislated that a database will be built that will house both
Department of Defense health records and Department of Veteran Affairs health records. But
I want to take that thought a step further. My company was 204 marines and sailors strong.
As I looked at and I talked to my marines from my unit, what we came up with is we are
well in excess of a dozen of our members that committed suicide.

When I talk to senior leadership in the battalion, and battalion is about six to seven
hundred marines, they estimate that we're in the hundreds who have committed suicide. So
let's take this database that we're building, and let's go a little bit further with it.
What if when a veteran passes away, whether it's natural causes, overdose or suicide,
we're able to feed that into the Veteran Affairs who is then able to access Department of
Defense records, identify what type of units they were in, what contingencies and
operations did they participate in, and let's build the data points to try to figure out
are there units that are more susceptible to develop post-traumatic stress disorder so
that we can get them the mental health prior to going on deployment, prior to being in
theater. If they're in theater, get them the mental health while they're in theater, and
get them mental health counseling and help before they even come home out of
theater.

And by the way, if we can build those sets of data points to be able to do that, we don't
just apply them to the military, we can also use that for the general population. If we
put our minds together and our resources together, and we openly talk about this, and try
to find solutions for this epidemic that's going on in America, hopefully we can save a
life. Those are my thoughts, my ideas, I hope that this talk is not the end of this
discussion but rather the beginning of it. And I want to thank you for your time
today.
