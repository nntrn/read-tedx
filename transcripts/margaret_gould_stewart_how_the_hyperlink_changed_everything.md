I remember thinking to myself, "This is going to change everything about how we
communicate."[Small thing.] [Big idea.][Margaret Gould Stewart on the Hyperlink]A
hyperlink is an interface element, and what I mean by that is, when you're using software
on your phone or your computer, there's a lot of code behind the interface that's giving
all the instructions for the computer on how to manage it, but that interface is the thing
that humans interact with: when we press on this, then something happens. When they first
came around, they were pretty simple and not particularly glamorous. Designers today have
a huge range of options. The hyperlink uses what's called a markup language — HTML.
There's a little string of code. And then you put the address of where you want to send
the person. It's actually remarkably easy to learn how to do. And so, the whole range of
references to information elsewhere on the internet is the domain of the hyperlink. Back
when I was in school — this is before people had wide access to the internet — if I was
going to do a research paper, I would have to physically walk to the library, and if they
had the book that you needed, great.

You sometimes had to send out for it, so the process could take weeks. And it's kind of
crazy to think about that now, because, like all great innovations, it's not long after we
get access to something that we start to take it for granted. Back in 1945, there was this
guy, Vannevar Bush. He was working for the US government, and one of the ideas that he put
forth was, "Wow, humans are creating so much information, and we can't keep track of all
the books that we've read or the connections between important ideas." And he had this
idea called the "memex," where you could put together a personal library of all of the
books and articles that you have access to. And that idea of connecting sources captured
people's imaginations. Later, in the 1960s, Ted Nelson launches Project Xanadu, and he
said, "Well, what if it wasn't just limited to the things that I have? What if I could
connect ideas across a larger body of work?" In 1982, researchers at the University of
Maryland developed a system they called HyperTIES.

They were the first to use text itself as a link marker. They figured out that this blue
link on a gray background was going to work really well in terms of contrast, and people
would be able to see it. Apple invented HyperCard in 1987. You had these stacks of cards,
and you could create links in between the cards. HyperCard actually created the ability to
jump around in a story. These kinds of notions of nonlinear storytelling got a huge boost
when the hyperlink came along, because it gave people the opportunity to influence the
narrative. These ideas and inventions, among others, inspired Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor
of the World Wide Web. The hyperlink almost feels like a LEGO block, this very basic
building block to a very complex web of connections that exists all around the world.
Because of the way that hyperlinks were first constructed, they were intended to be not
only used by many people, but created by many people.

To me, it's one of the most democratic designs ever created.
