I think stairs may be one of the most emotionally malleable physical elements that an
architect has to work with.[Small thing. Big idea.][David Rockwell on the Stairs]At its
most basic, a stair is a way to get from point A to point B at different elevations.
Stairs have a common language. Treads, which is the thing that you walk on. Riser, which
is the vertical element that separates the two treads. A lot of stairs have nosings that
create a kind of edge. And then, the connected piece is a stringer. Those pieces, in
different forms, make up all stairs. I assume stairs came to be from the first time someone
said, "I want to get to this higher rock from the lower rock." People climbed using
whatever was available: stepped logs, ladders and natural pathways that were worn over
time. Some of the earliest staircases, like the pyramids in Chichén Itzá or the roads to
Mount Tai in China, were a means of getting to a higher elevation, which people sought for
worship or for protection. As engineering has evolved, so has what's practical.

Stairs can be made from all kinds of material. There are linear stairs, there are spiraled
stairs. Stairs can be indoors, they can be outdoors. They clearly help us in an emergency.
But they're also a form of art in and of themselves. As we move across a stairway, the form
dictates our pacing, our feeling, our safety and our relationship and engagement with the
space around us. So for a second, think about stepping down a gradual, monumental
staircase like the one in front of the New York Public Library. From those steps, you have
a view of the street and all the people around you, and your walk is slow and steady
because the tread is so wide. That's a totally different experience than going down the
narrow staircase to, say, an old pub, where you spill into the room. There, you encounter
tall risers, so you move more quickly. Stairs add enormous drama. Think about how stairs
signaled a grand entrance and were the star of that moment. Stairs can even be
heroic.

The staircase that remained standing after September 11th and the attack on the World
Trade Center was dubbed the "Survivors' Staircase," because it played such a central role
in leading hundreds of people to safety. But small stairs can have a huge impact, too. The
stoop is a place that invites neighbors to gather, blast music, and watch the city in
motion. It's fascinating to me that you see people wanting to hang out on the stairs. I
think they fill a deeply human need we have to inhabit a space more than just on the
ground plane. And so if you're able to sit halfway up there, you're in a kind of magical
place.
