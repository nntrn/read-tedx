When I was pregnant, I just got very frustrated. Don't eat deli meats, do this particular
prenatal test. Why did you make that choice? Why didn't you make a different choice? I
felt like I was being told to do things, and I never got the answer to why.[The Way We
Work]Sometimes in the world of modern parenting you just can't seem to win. If I go back
to work, I spend less time with my kid. What if they don't get the attention they need to
adequately develop? If I stay home and give up my income stream, will I look back and
regret my decision? There's a lot of conflicting advice out there about whether to stay
home or go back to work, so trying to make a choice between the two can be confusing and
emotional. You love your kids and want what's best for them, but how do you determine what
best means when everyone has a different opinion? There are many variations of parents that
a household can have, and I think more families should be asking the question of whether
it makes sense for the male partner to stay home.

But the truth is that in the current time, most of the discussions about stay-at-home
parents focus on women in particular. And it's usually the women who say they feel that
what they do during the day is going to determine at a deep level what kind of mom and
person they are. That is a huge weight to put on yourself as a parent. And when you're met
with the side-eye after telling someone you're going back to work or not, it can poke
holes in your confidence. I decided to dig in and find out. Is it better to stay at home or
go back to work? It's an emotional decision, yes, but as an economist I've learned that we
can use data to help navigate through those emotional decisions and feel confident we're
making the best decision for our family. Specifically there are three main factors you
should consider before you decide. First, you need to think about how this decision will
affect your family budget. Let's do some numbers.

Say your total household income is 100,000 dollars, with you and your partner making
50,000 each. That means you bring home about 85,000 dollars after taxes. If both of you
work and the family pays 1,500 dollars a month for childcare, your total disposable income
would be 67,000 dollars a year. Are you with me so far? If you decide to stay home, your
family makes less but you don't pay for childcare. Your disposable income goes down in
this scenario, but not by as much as it would if you didn't factor in the childcare. It
becomes more complicated if childcare is more expensive in your area. A full-time nanny
can run 40, 50,000 dollars a year depending on where you live. If that's the case in your
neighborhood, in the scenario I outlined, it would completely wipe out one parent's
income, and you'd be better off financially with one parent staying home. Of course, this
is only a short-term analysis.

Childcare is less expensive sometimes when kids are in school, and you may make a higher
income later, so you want to factor that in if you can. Once you've done the math, you'll
know what's possible and you'll be able to make a more informed choice, which should feel
empowering. Second, it's time to talk about what's best for your child. You may think this
should be the core of your decision, but there's actually no right answer. According to
studies from Europe and the US, the decision to go back to work or stay at home won't
actually make or break your child's future success. Research shows that two parents
working full-time has a similar effect on your child's future test scores and income to
one parent working and one not. What seems to be most important is the environment your
child is in during their spare time. As long as they're engaging in enriching activities;
reading, practicing their motor skills, interacting with other kids, they're going to
thrive whether or not you're at home. There is a bit of nuance in the data.

For example, studies have found, that if both parents work, kids from poorer families are
impacted positively, and kids from richer families are impacted less positively. So
depending on your household configuration, the effects on your child could be a little
positive, or a little negative, but the overall impact is negligible. Now I want to call
out an exception: maternity leave. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that
babies do better when their mothers take some maternity leave. The early days with your
child can impact their development, so if you have paid leave, you should take it, and if
you don't, maybe consider taking some unpaid leave for those first few months, if your
budget allows. And finally, ask yourself, what do I want? While this may seem simple, it's
the factor that feels most taboo to explore. In talking to parents I find that when a
woman chooses to stay home, she often feels obligated to say she made this choice for her
children's optimal development.

Which, sure, can be part of the reason, but a perfectly acceptable answer is, "this is the
lifestyle I prefer," or "this is what works for my family." The same goes for the working
mother. Saying, "I like my job, and that's why I went back to work," is enough. If you
want to go back to work, that's great. You're lucky to have a job that you love and you
have every right to keep it once you become a parent. Be honest with yourself about what
you'd like to do. If you're upfront about that, you're guaranteed to feel happier, which
will allow you to be the best version of a parent you can be, and isn't that the whole
point? There is no right and wrong when it comes to parenting. The best decision is the
one that will make you — and your family — the happiest. Up to you to decide what's next.
By acknowledging that the choice to stay home or not is just that, a choice, with factors
pushing you in various directions, we can ditch the guilt and enjoy doing what feels best
for our families.
