protein pills and put your helmet on. Al Gore: Ten, Nine, Eight, Seven, Six ...AP: Ground
Control to Major Tom,AG: Five, Four, Three, Two, One ... AP: Commencing countdown, engines
on. Check ignition and may God's love be with you. AG: Liftoff. AP: This is Ground Control to
Major Tom,You've really made the gradeAnd the papers want to know whose shirts you
wear. Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare."This is Major Tom to Ground
Control,I'm stepping through the doorAnd I'm floating in a most peculiar wayAnd the stars
look very different today. For here am I floating round my tin can. Far above the
world,Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do."

"Though I'm past 100,000 miles,I'm feeling very still, and I think my spaceship knows
which way to go. Tell my wife I love her very much she knows."Ground Control to Major Tom,
your circuit's dead, there's something wrong. Can you hear me, Major Tom? Can you hear me,
Major Tom? Can you hear me, Major Tom? Can you ..."Here am I floating round my tin can, far
above the Moon. Planet Earth is blue and there's nothing I can do.

["I'm not a prophet or a stone-age man, just a mortal with the potential of a superman ...
... I'm living on." David Bowie, 1947-2016]
