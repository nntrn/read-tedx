title: How to avoid surveillance ... with the phone in your pocket
speaker: Christopher Soghoian
description: >-
 Who is listening in on your phone calls? On a landline, it could be anyone, says
 privacy activist Christopher Soghoian, because surveillance backdoors are built
 into the phone system by default, to allow governments to listen in. But then
 again, so could a foreign intelligence service ... or a criminal. Which is why,
 says Soghoian, some tech companies are resisting governments' call to build the
 same backdoors into mobile phones and new messaging systems. From this TED
 Fellow, learn how some tech companies are working to keep your calls and messages
 private.

For more than 100 years, the telephone companies have provided wiretapping assistance to
governments. For much of this time, this assistance was manual. Surveillance took place
manually and wires were connected by hand. Calls were recorded to tape. But as in so many
other industries, computing has changed everything. The telephone companies built
surveillance features into the very core of their networks. I want that to sink in for a
second: Our telephones and the networks that carry our calls were wired for surveillance
first. First and foremost. So what that means is that when you're talking to your spouse,
your children, a colleague or your doctor on the telephone, someone could be listening.
Now, that someone might be your own government; it could also be another government, a
foreign intelligence service, or a hacker, or a criminal, or a stalker or any other party
that breaks into the surveillance system, that hacks into the surveillance system of the
telephone companies. But while the telephone companies have built surveillance as a
priority, Silicon Valley companies have not.

And increasingly, over the last couple years, Silicon Valley companies have built strong
encryption technology into their communications products that makes surveillance extremely
difficult. For example, many of you might have an iPhone, and if you use an iPhone to send
a text message to other people who have an iPhone, those text messages cannot easily be
wiretapped. And in fact, according to Apple, they're not able to even see the text
messages themselves. Likewise, if you use FaceTime to make an audio call or a video call
with one of your friends or loved ones, that, too, cannot be easily wiretapped. And it's
not just Apple. WhatsApp, which is now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions
of people around the world, also has built strong encryption technology into its product,
which means that people in the Global South can easily communicate without their
governments, often authoritarian, wiretapping their text messages. So, after 100 years of
being able to listen to any telephone call — anytime, anywhere — you might imagine that
government officials are not very happy.

And in fact, that's what's happening. Government officials are extremely mad. And they're
not mad because these encryption tools are now available. What upsets them the most is
that the tech companies have built encryption features into their products and turned them
on by default. It's the default piece that matters. In short, the tech companies have
democratized encryption. And so, government officials like British Prime Minister David
Cameron, they believe that all communications — emails, texts, voice calls — all of these
should be available to governments, and encryption is making that difficult. Now, look —
I'm extremely sympathetic to their point of view. We live in a dangerous time in a
dangerous world, and there really are bad people out there. There are terrorists and other
serious national security threats that I suspect we all want the FBI and the NSA to
monitor. But those surveillance features come at a cost.

The reason for that is that there is no such thing as a terrorist laptop, or a drug
dealer's cell phone. We all use the same communications devices. What that means is that
if the drug dealers' telephone calls or the terrorists' telephone calls can be
intercepted, then so can the rest of ours, too. And I think we really need to ask: Should
a billion people around the world be using devices that are wiretap friendly? So the
scenario of hacking of surveillance systems that I've described — this is not imaginary.
In 2009, the surveillance systems that Google and Microsoft built into their networks —
the systems that they use to respond to lawful surveillance requests from the police —
those systems were compromised by the Chinese government, because the Chinese government
wanted to figure out which of their own agents the US government was monitoring. By the
same token, in 2004, the surveillance system built into the network of Vodafone Greece —
Greece's largest telephone company — was compromised by an unknown entity, and that
feature, the surveillance feature, was used to wiretap the Greek Prime Minister and
members of the Greek cabinet.

The foreign government or hackers who did that were never caught. And really, this gets to
the very problem with these surveillance features, or backdoors. When you build a backdoor
into a communications network or piece of technology, you have no way of controlling who's
going to go through it. You have no way of controlling whether it'll be used by your side
or the other side, by good guys, or by bad guys. And so for that reason, I think that it's
better to build networks to be as secure as possible. Yes, this means that in the future,
encryption is going to make wiretapping more difficult. It means that the police are going
to have a tougher time catching bad guys. But the alternative would mean to live in a
world where anyone's calls or anyone's text messages could be surveilled by criminals, by
stalkers and by foreign intelligence agencies. And I don't want to live in that kind of
world. And so right now, you probably have the tools to thwart many kinds of government
surveillance already on your phones and already in your pockets, you just might not
realize how strong and how secure those tools are, or how weak the other ways you've used
to communicate really are. And so, my message to you is this: We need to use these
tools.

We need to secure our telephone calls. We need to secure our text messages. I want you to
use these tools. I want you to tell your loved ones, I want you to tell your colleagues:
Use these encrypted communications tools. Don't just use them because they're cheap and
easy, but use them because they're secure. Thank you.
