 What color is a mirror? How much does a video weigh? Michael Stevens, creator of
 the popular educational YouTube channel Vsauce, spends his day asking quirky
 questions like these. In this talk he shows how asking the right -- seemingly
 silly -- questions can make incredibly effective lessons.

Bean bags are awesome. But I see a few people out there who are standing, we've got some
over here, and standing takes more work than lounging. Using the Live Strong
Organization's online database of weight loss resources, you can calculate that by the
time I'm done with this speech, those of you who are standing will have burned 7.5 more
calories than those of you who are bean-bagging it. 

Okay, here's a question, speaking of weight loss, specifically weight, this speech is
live. I'm actually here in front of you guys, we're all here together. But this speech is
being recorded and it will become a video that people can access all over the world on
computers, mobile devices, televisions. I weight about 190 pounds. How much will the video
weigh? Asking questions like that is what I do every week on my channel Vsauce. For the
last two years, I have been asking really fun questions, mind-boggling questions, and
approaching them as sincerely as I can, celebrating scientific concepts and scientists.
And I research and write and produce and host and edit and upload and run the social media
all by myself, but it's not lonely, because Vsauce has more than 2 million subscribers,
and every month, my videos are seen by more than 20 million people. Yeah.

It's very exciting. I've found that asking a strange question is a great way to get people
in, not just people, but fans. And fans are different than just viewers or an audience,
because fans want to come back. They subscribe to you on YouTube and they want to watch
everything you've made and everything you plan to make in the future because we are
curious people and sparking curiosity is great bait. It's a great way to catch a human.
And once you've caught them, you have this captive audience that you can, with the goal in
mind of answering the question, accidentally teach a lot of things to. So, let's take a
look at some of my videos. Here are eight of them. But down here in the lower-right
corner, "What Color is a Mirror?" When people see that, it's very difficult not to click,
because you think, "Come on, are you serious? How could you possibly answer that
question?" Well, so far, 7.6 million people have watched this five-minute video about what
color a mirror is.

And in that episode, I answer the question and I get a chance to explain what would
normally be kind of dry topics: optics, diffuse versus specular reflection, how light
works, how light works on the retina, and even the etymology of color terms like white and
black. Okay, spoiler alert: mirrors are not clear, they are not silvery, like they're
often illustrated. Mirrors, technically speaking, are just a tiny, tiny, little bit ...
green. You can demonstrate this by putting two mirrors next to each other, facing so they
reflect back and forth forever. Look down that infinite reflection, and it will get
dimmer, because some light is lost or absorbed every time, but it will also become
greener, because green light, that is light of a wavelength that we perceive as green, is
best reflected by most mirrors. Okay, so, how much does a video weigh? Well, when you
stream a video onto your computer, that information is temporarily stored using
electrons.

And the number of electrons on your device won't actually increase or decrease. But it
takes energy to store them in one place, and, thanks to our friend Albert Einstein, we
know that energy and mass are related. Okay, so here's the thing: let's say you're
watching a YouTube video at a really nice resolution, 720p. Assuming a typical bit rate,
we can figure that a minute of YouTube video is going to need to involve about 10 million
electrons on your device. Plugging all those electrons and the energy it takes to hold
them in the correct place for you to see the video, into that formula, we can figure out
that one minute of YouTube video increases the mass of your computer by about 10 to the
negative 19th grams. Written out, it looks like this. 

That's like nothing. You could call that nothing, and you wouldn't really get in trouble,
because the best scales we've ever invented that we could try to use to actually to detect
that change are only accurate to 10 to the negative 9th grams. So, we can't measure it,
but we can, like we just did, calculate it. And that's really cool because when I was a
kid, my school had two shelves of science books. That was really cool, but I read all of
them within, like, two grades, and it was hard to get more books because books are heavy,
you need space for them and moving books around is tougher than what we can do today. With
numbers that small, I can fit thousands of books on my own little personal electronic
reader. I can stream hours and hours and days and days of YouTube video without my
computer ever getting measurably heavier. And as information becomes that light, it
becomes a lot more democratic, meaning that more teachers and presenters and creators and
viewers than ever before can be involved.

Right now, on YouTube, there is an explosion of content like this happening. The three
Vsauce channels are down there in the corner. But everyone else, all together,
collectively, their views dwarf what I can do alone or with the people that I work with,
and that is really, really exciting. It turns out that tapping into people's curiosity and
responsibly answering their questions is a brilliant way to build fans and an audience and
get in viewers. It's even a great way for brands and companies to build trust. So,
calculating the weight of a video is kind of a funny question, but I cannot wait to see
what we ask and answer next. As always, thanks for watching.
