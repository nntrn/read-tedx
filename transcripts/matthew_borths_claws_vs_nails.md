 Consider the claw. Frequently found on animals around the world, it's one of
 nature's most versatile tools. Bears use claws for digging as well as defense. An
 eagle's needle-like talons can pierce the skulls of their prey. Even the

Consider the claw. Frequently found on four-limbed animals around the world, it’s one of
nature’s most versatile tools. Bears use claws for digging as well as defense. An
eagle’s needle-like talons can pierce the skulls of their prey. And lions can retract
their massive claws for easy movement, before flicking them out to hunt. Even the
ancestors of primates used to wield these impressive appendages, until their claws
evolved into nails. So what in our evolutionary past led to this manicured adaptation,
and what can nails do that their sharper cousins can’t? When nails first appeared in the
fossil record around 55.8 million years ago, claws had already been present for over 260
million years in the ancestors of mammals and reptiles. But despite the gulf of time
between their emergence, these adaptations are both part of the same evolutionary story.
Both nails and claws are made of keratin— a tough, fibrous protein also found in horns,
scales, hooves and hair.

This protein is produced by a wedge of tissue called the keratin matrix. Rich in blood
vessels and nutrients, this protein factory produces an endless stream of keratin, which
is tightly packed into cells called keratinocytes. These high-density cells give nails
and claws their trademark toughness. Since nails evolved from claws, both adaptations
produce keratinocytes in the same way. The cells grow out from the matrix, emerging from
the skin where they die and harden into a water-resistant sheath. The primary difference
between the two keratin coverings is really just their shape, which depends on the shape
of the bone at the end of the animal’s digits. In claws, the bed of keratinocytes 
conforms to a narrow finger bone, wrapping around the end of the digit and radiating
outwards to form a cone-shaped structure. Animals with nails, on the other hand, have
much broader digits, and keratinocytes only cover the top surface of their wide
bones. It’s possible that nails have simply persisted as a side effect of primates
evolving wider, more dexterous fingers.

But given what we know about the habitats of our primate ancestors, it’s more likely that
nails came with their own powerful advantages. High in the forest canopy where these
primates lived, wide finger bones and expansive finger pads were ideal for gripping
narrow branches. And nails improved that grip even further. By providing a rigid surface 
to press against, primates could splay out their pads to create even more contact with
the trees. Additionally, nails improved the sensitivity of their digits by providing an
extra surface to detect changes in pressure while climbing. This combination of
sensitivity and dexterity gave our ancestors the precise motor control needed to snatch
up insects, pinch berries and seeds, and keep a firm grip on slim branches. The evolution
of nails and the evolution of opposable thumbs and toes are closely linked. And when our
ancestors moved down from the trees, this flexible grasp enabled them to create and wield
complex tools. Even if it was possible for wide fingers to sport claws, their sharp points
would’ve likely interfered with these primates’ regular tasks.

Claws are ideal for piercing, puncturing, and hooking, but their points make grabbing
difficult, and potentially dangerous. However, both claws and nails are used in some
unexpected ways. Manatees use nails to grasp their food, and researchers think elephant
toenails may sense vibrations in the ground to help them hear. Meanwhile, some primates, 
like the aye-ayes of Madagascar, have re-acquired claws. They use these extra-long
appendages to tap branches and trunks, while listening for hollow sections with their
bat-like ears. When they hear an opening, they burrow into the tree and skewer grubs with
their needle-like middle finger. We’ve only scratched the surface of all the incredible
ways nails and claws are used throughout the animal kingdom. But as for which of these 
adaptations is better? That’s an answer we may never nail down.
