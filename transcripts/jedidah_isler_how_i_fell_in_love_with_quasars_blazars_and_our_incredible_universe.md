title: How I fell in love with quasars, blazars and our incredible universe
speaker: Jedidah Isler
description: >-
 Jedidah Isler first fell in love with the night sky as a little girl. Now she's
 an astrophysicist who studies supermassive hyperactive black holes. In a charming
 talk, she takes us trillions of kilometers from Earth to introduce us to objects
 that can be 1 to 10 billion times the mass of the sun — and which shoot powerful
 jet streams of particles in our direction.

My first love was for the night sky. Love is complicated. You're looking at a fly-through
of the Hubble Space Telescope Ultra-Deep Field, one of the most distant images of our
universe ever observed. Everything you see here is a galaxy, comprised of billions of
stars each. And the farthest galaxy is a trillion, trillion kilometers away. As an
astrophysicist, I have the awesome privilege of studying some of the most exotic objects 
in our universe. The objects that have captivated me from first crush throughout my
career are supermassive, hyperactive black holes. Weighing one to 10 billion times the
mass of our own sun, these galactic black holes are devouring material, at a rate of
upwards of 1,000 times more than your "average" supermassive black hole.

These two characteristics, with a few others, make them quasars. At the same time, the
objects I study are producing some of the most powerful particle streams ever observed.
These narrow streams, called jets, are moving at 99.99 percent of the speed of light, and
are pointed directly at the Earth. These jetted, Earth-pointed, hyperactive and
supermassive black holes are called blazars, or blazing quasars. What makes blazars so
special is that they're some of the universe's most efficient particle accelerators,
transporting incredible amounts of energy throughout a galaxy. Here, I'm showing an
artist's conception of a blazar. The dinner plate by which material falls onto the black
hole is called the accretion disc, shown here in blue. Some of that material is
slingshotted around the black hole and accelerated to insanely high speeds in the jet,
shown here in white. Although the blazar system is rare, the process by which nature pulls
in material via a disk, and then flings some of it out via a jet, is more
common.

We'll eventually zoom out of the blazar system to show its approximate relationship to
the larger galactic context. Beyond the cosmic accounting of what goes in to what goes out,
one of the hot topics in blazar astrophysics right now is where the highest-energy jet
emission comes from. In this image, I'm interested in where this white blob forms and if,
as a result, there's any relationship between the jet and the accretion disc
material. Clear answers to this question were almost completely inaccessible until 2008,
when NASA launched a new telescope that better detects gamma ray light — that is, light
with energies a million times higher than your standard x-ray scan. I simultaneously
compare variations between the gamma ray light data and the visible light data from day to
day and year to year, to better localize these gamma ray blobs. My research shows that in
some instances, these blobs form much closer to the black hole than we initially
thought. As we more confidently localize where these gamma ray blobs are forming, we can
better understand how jets are being accelerated, and ultimately reveal the dynamic
processes by which some of the most fascinating objects in our universe are formed. This
all started as a love story.

And it still is. This love transformed me from a curious, stargazing young girl to a
professional astrophysicist, hot on the heels of celestial discovery. Who knew that
chasing after the universe would ground me so deeply to my mission here on Earth. Then
again, when do we ever know where love's first flutter will truly take us. Thank
you.
