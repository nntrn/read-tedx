Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories, only to find out that
you're a performance artist.

I'm also a software engineer, and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer.
And I think the main thing that I'm interested in is trying to find a way of making the
computer into a personal mode of expression. And many of you out there are the heads of
Macromedia and Microsoft, and in a way those are my bane: I think there's a great
homogenizing force that software imposes on people and limits the way they think about
what's possible on the computer. Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes
possible, you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on. But, in a way, the
computer makes possible much more than what most people think, and my art has just been
about trying to find a personal way of using the computer, and so I end up writing
software to do that. Chris has asked me to do a short performance, and so I'm going to take
just this time — maybe 10 minutes — to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a
moment to show you a couple of my other projects in video form. Thank you.

We've got about a minute left. I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project. I
did a performance with two singers who specialize in making strange noises with their
mouths. And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica; we repeated it in
England. And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them with a large
screen. We used a computer vision tracking system in order to know where they were. And
since we know where their heads are, and we have a wireless mic on them that we're
processing the sound from, we're able to create visualizations which are linked very
tightly to what they're doing with their speech. This will take about 30 seconds or so.
He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound. Well, suffice it to say it's not all like
that, but that's part of it. Thanks very much. There's always lots more. I'm overtime, so I
just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York, you can check out my work at the
Whitney Biennial next week, and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.

And with that, I think I should give up the stage, so, thank you so much.
