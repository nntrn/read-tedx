In her Auntie An-mei’s home, Jing-Mei reluctantly takes her seat at the eastern corner of
the mahjong table. At the north, south, and west corners are her aunties, long-time
members of the Joy Luck Club. This group of immigrant families comes together weekly to
trade gossip, feast on wonton and sweet chaswei, and play mahjong. However, the club’s
founder, Jing-Mei’s mother Suyuan, has recently passed away. At first, Jing-Mei struggles
 to fill her place at the table. But when her aunties reveal a deeply buried secret about
Suyuan’s life, Jing-Mei realizes she still has a lot to learn about her mother, and
herself. In Amy Tan’s 1989 debut novel, "The Joy Luck Club," this gathering at the mahjong
table is the point of departure for a series of interconnected vignettes. The book itself
is loosely structured to imitate the format of the Chinese game. Just as mahjong is
played over four rounds with at least four hands each, the book is divided into four
parts, each with four chapters.

Alternately set in China or San Francisco, each chapter narrates a single story from one
of the four matriarchs of the Joy Luck Club or their American-born daughters. These
stories take the reader through war zones and villages of rural China, and into modern
marriages and tense gatherings around the dinner table. They touch upon themes of
survival and loss, love and the lack of it, ambitions and their unsatisfied reality. In
one, Auntie Lin plots an escape from the hostile family of her promised husband,
ultimately leading to her arrival in America. In another, the Hsu family’s all-American 
day at the beach turns dire when Rose is overwhelmed by the responsibility her mother
assigns to her. The resulting tragedy traumatizes the family for years to come. These
tales illustrate the common divides that can form between generations and cultures, 
especially in immigrant families. The mothers have all experienced great hardships during
their lives in China, and they’ve worked tirelessly to give their children better
opportunities in America.

But their daughters feel weighed down by their parent’s unfulfilled hopes and high
expectations. Jing-Mei feels this pressure as she plays mahjong with her mother’s
friends. She worries, “In me, they see their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as
unmindful of all the truths and hopes they have brought to America.” Time and again, the
mothers strive to remind their daughters of their history and heritage. Meanwhile, their
daughters struggle to reconcile their mothers’ perception of them with who they really
are. "Does my daughter know me?" some of the stories ask. "Why doesn’t my mother
understand?" others respond. In her interrogation of these questions, Tan speaks to
anxieties that plague many immigrants, who often feel both alienated from their homeland
and disconnected from their adopted country. But by weaving the tales of these four
mothers and daughters together, Tan makes it clear that Jing-Mei and her peers find
strength to tackle their present-day problems through the values their mothers passed on
to them. When "The Joy Luck Club" was first published, Tan expected minimal
success.

But against her predictions, the book was a massive critical and commercial achievement.
Today, these characters still captivate readers worldwide. Not only for the way they
speak to Chinese American and immigrant experiences, but also for uncovering a deeper
truth: the need to be seen and understood by the ones you love.
