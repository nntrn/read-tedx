title: How does the immune system work?
speaker: Emma Bryce
description: >-
 Inside you, a daily battle is being waged and your immune system is at the
 frontline. Most of the time, you may not even notice it's there, but over the
 course of your life your immune system will guard you against hundreds of
 potentially fatal threats. Emma Bryce explores the different components of this
 system and how, together, they do their vital work. [Directed by Felipe Grosso &
 Odirlei Seixas, narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Vadeco Schettini].

A mosquito lands on your arm, injects its chemicals into your skin, and begins to feed.
You wouldn’t even know it was there, if not for the red lump that appears, accompanied by
a telltale itch. It’s a nuisance, but that bump is an important signal that you’re
protected by your immune system, your body’s major safeguard against infection, illness,
and disease. This system is a vast network of cells, tissues, and organs that coordinate
your body’s defenses against any threats to your health. Without it, you’d be exposed to
billions of bacteria, viruses, and toxins that could make something as minor as a paper
cut or a seasonal cold fatal. The immune system relies on millions of defensive white
blood cells, also known as leukocytes, that originate in our bone marrow. These cells
migrate into the bloodstream and the lymphatic system, a network of vessels which helps 
clear bodily toxins and waste.

Our bodies are teeming with leukocytes: there are between 4,000 and 11,000 in every
microliter of blood. As they move around, leukocytes work like security personnel,
constantly screening the blood, tissues, and organs for suspicious signs. This system
mainly relies on cues called antigens. These molecular traces on the surface of
pathogens and other foreign substances betray the presence of invaders. As soon as the
leukocytes detect them, it takes only minutes for the body’s protective immune response
to kick in. Threats to our bodies are hugely variable, so the immune response has to be
equally adaptable. That means relying on many different types of leukocytes to tackle
threats in different ways. Despite this diversity, we classify leukocytes in two main
cellular groups, which coordinate a two-pronged attack. First, phagocytes trigger the
immune response by sending macrophages and dendritic cells into the blood.

As these circulate, they destroy any foreign cells they encounter, simply by consuming
them. That allows phagocytes to identify the antigen on the invaders they just ingested
and transmit this information to the second major cell group orchestrating the defense,
the lymphocytes. A group of lymphocyte cells called T-cells go in search of infected body
cells and swiftly kill them off. Meanwhile, B-cells and helper T-cells use the information
gathered from the unique antigens to start producing special proteins called antibodies.
This is the pièce de résistance: Each antigen has a unique, matching antibody that can
latch onto it like a lock and key, and destroy the invading cells. B-cells can produce
millions of these, which then cycle through the body and attack the invaders until the
worst of the threat is neutralized. While all of this is going on, familiar symptoms, like
high temperatures and swelling, are actually processes designed to aid the immune
response.

A warmer body makes it harder for bacteria and viruses to reproduce and spread because
they’re temperature-sensitive. And when body cells are damaged, they release chemicals
that make fluid leak into the surrounding tissues, causing swelling. That also attracts
phagocytes, which consume the invaders and the damaged cells. Usually, an immune response 
will eradicate a threat within a few days. It won’t always stop you from getting ill, but
that’s not its purpose. Its actual job is to stop a threat from escalating to dangerous 
levels inside your body. And through constant surveillance over time, the immune system 
provides another benefit: it helps us develop long-term immunity. When B- and T-cells
identify antigens, they can use that information to recognize invaders in the future. So,
when a threat revisits, the cells can swiftly deploy the right antibodies to tackle it
before it affects any more cells.

That’s how you can develop immunity to certain diseases, like chickenpox. It doesn’t
always work so well. Some people have autoimmune diseases, which trick the immune system
into attacking the body’s own perfectly healthy cells. No one knows exactly what causes
them, but these disorders sabotage the immune system to varying degrees, and underlie
problems like arthritis, Type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. For most individuals,
however, a healthy immune system will successfully fight off an estimated 300 colds and
innumerable other potential infections over the course of a lifetime. Without it, those
threats would escalate into something far more dangerous. So the next time you catch a
cold or scratch a mosquito bite, think of the immune system. We owe it our
lives.
