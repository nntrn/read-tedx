title: We Are the Halluci Nation
speaker: A Tribe Called Red
description: >-
 A Tribe Called Red creates music that acts as a gateway into urban, contemporary
 indigenous culture, celebrating all of its layers and complexity. In a set that
 blends traditional powwow drums and vocals with hip-hop and electronic music, the
 DJ collective tells stories of the First Nations in beats and images -- expanding
 on the concept of the "Halluci Nation," inspired by the poet, musician and
 activist John Trudell.
