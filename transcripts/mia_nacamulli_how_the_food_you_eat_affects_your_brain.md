title: How the food you eat affects your brain
speaker: Mia Nacamulli
description: >-
 When it comes to what you bite, chew and swallow, your choices have a direct and
 long-lasting effect on the most powerful organ in your body: your brain. So which
 foods cause you to feel so tired after lunch? Or so restless at night? Mia
 Nacamulli takes you into the brain to find out. [Directed by Private Island,
 narrated by Addison Anderson].

Your Brain on Food If you sucked all of the moisture out of your brain and broke it down
to its constituent nutritional content, what would it look like? Most of the weight of
your dehydrated brain would come from fats, also known as lipids. In the remaining brain
matter, you would find proteins and amino acids, traces of micronutrients, and glucose.
The brain is, of course, more than just the sum of its nutritional parts, but each
component does have a distinct impact on functioning, development, mood, and energy. So
that post-lunch apathy, or late-night alertness you might be feeling, well, that could
simply be the effects of food on your brain. Of the fats in your brain, the superstars are
omegas 3 and 6. These essential fatty acids, which have been linked to preventing
degenerative brain conditions, must come from our diets. So eating omega-rich foods, like
nuts, seeds, and fatty fish, is crucial to the creation and maintenance of cell
membranes.

And while omegas are good fats for your brain, long-term consumption of other fats, like
trans and saturated fats, may compromise brain health. Meanwhile, proteins and amino
acids, the building block nutrients of growth and development, manipulate how we feel and
behave. Amino acids contain the precursors to neurotransmitters, the chemical messengers
that carry signals between neurons, affecting things like mood, sleep, attentiveness, and
weight. They're one of the reasons we might feel calm after eating a large plate of pasta,
or more alert after a protein-rich meal. The complex combinations of compounds in food
can stimulate brain cells to release mood-altering norepinephrine, dopamine, and
serotonin. But getting to your brain cells is tricky, and amino acids have to compete for
limited access. A diet with a range of foods helps maintain a balanced combination of
brain messengers, and keeps your mood from getting skewed in one direction or the
other.

Like the other organs in our bodies, our brains also benefit from a steady supply of
micronutrients. Antioxidants in fruits and vegetables strengthen the brain to fight off
free radicals that destroy brain cells, enabling your brain to work well for a longer
period of time. And without powerful micronutrients, like the vitamins B6, B12, and folic
acid, our brains would be susceptible to brain disease and mental decline. Trace amounts
of the minerals iron, copper, zinc, and sodium are also fundamental to brain health and
early cognitive development. In order for the brain to efficiently transform and
synthesize these valuable nutrients, it needs fuel, and lots of it. While the human brain
only makes up about 2% of our body weight, it uses up to 20% of our energy resources. Most
of this energy comes from carbohydrates that our body digests into glucose, or blood
sugar. The frontal lobes are so sensitive to drops in glucose, in fact, that a change in
mental function is one of the primary signals of nutrient deficiency.

Assuming that we are getting glucose regularly, how does the specific type of
carbohydrates we eat affect our brains? Carbs come in three forms: starch, sugar, and
fiber. While on most nutrition labels, they are all lumped into one total carb count, the
ratio of the sugar and fiber subgroups to the whole amount affect how the body and brain
respond. A high glycemic food, like white bread, causes a rapid release of glucose into
the blood, and then comes the dip. Blood sugar shoots down, and with it, our attention
span and mood. On the other hand, oats, grains, and legumes have slower glucose release,
enabling a steadier level of attentiveness. For sustained brain power, opting for a
varied diet of nutrient-rich foods is critical. When it comes to what you bite, chew, and
swallow, your choices have a direct and long-lasting effect on the most powerful organ in
your body.
