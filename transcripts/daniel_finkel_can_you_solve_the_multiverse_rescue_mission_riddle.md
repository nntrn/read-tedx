title: Can you solve the multiverse rescue mission riddle?
speaker: Daniel Finkel
description: >-
 It was a normal Tuesday at the superconductor, until a bug in the system caused
 your team to be trapped in 11 separate dimensions. Fortunately, there's a
 half-finished experimental teleportation robot that may be able to get you all
 home... if you can figure out how to work it. Can you work out the robot's design
 quirks and get your team back home safely? Dan Finkel shows how. [Directed by
 Artrake Studio, narrated by Addison Anderson].

It was a normal Tuesday at the superconductor, until a bug in the system created a small
situation. Now your team is trapped in eleven separate pocket dimensions. Luckily for
you, there’s a half-finished experimental teleportation robot that may be able to get you
all home, if you can figure out how to work through the quirks of its design. Over
interdimensional radio, your engineers explain that the robot can teleport into the 
alternate universes you’re trapped in, but it’ll do so completely at random. The robot has
two levers and one big button. When it appears, you just switch the position of one of
the levers from A to B or vice versa, and then the robot will note your dimensional
position and teleport to another of the eleven dimensions at random. If it shows up
again, you’ll have to pull a lever before it’ll teleport away. When anyone presses the
button, the robot will bring everyone who pulled a lever back home.

Anyone who didn’t will be lost in the multi-verse forever. The challenge is to make sure
everyone has pulled a lever before anyone hits the button. While you can talk to each
other now over the interdimensional radio and agree on a plan, the robot’s teleportation
technology will interfere with all attempts at communication once it arrives. You won’t
be able to attach messages to the robot or scratch notes into its superstrong alloy body.
Your only way to communicate information is to change the position of exactly one lever
or hit the button. What plan will make sure everyone gets home? Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3Answer in 2Answer in 1It would be nice if
you could set different combinations of the levers to indicate who’s already been
visited by the robot. But it has only two levers. That gives four combinations— far too
few to communicate about 11 people, especially when you’re forced to flip one to send
the robot onward.

There must be another way. The critical insight is that not everyone has to know when every
pocket dimension has been visited. If one person accepts responsibility ahead of time for
hitting the button, then only they need to know who the robot has visited. In fact, they
don’t even need to know exactly who’s been visited… just how many people have been. You
volunteer to be the person in charge of pressing the button when the moment is right, and
give the following directions to everyone else. Your plan is simple: you’ll use the left
lever to count visits, and the right lever will have no meaning, so there’s no harm in 
moving it up or down. Each of the others will pull the left lever from position A to
position B exactly once. If the robot appears with the left lever already pulled down, or
if an individual has previously pulled the left lever down at any point in the past, then
they should move the right lever.

You, meanwhile, will be the only one who ever resets the left lever from position B to
position A. This gives you a way to count how many people have been visited by the robot.
Everyone needs to pull the left lever down exactly once, and you’re the only one to pull
it back up. So you know that the tenth time the robot visits you with its left lever in
the down position, it must have visited all ten of the others. And that means you’re safe
to press the button and teleport everyone home. It may take a while– most likely the
robot will need to teleport around 355 times; but better that than leave anyone behind.
Your teammates phase back into your home dimension one at a time. The mission proves a
great success. Well...mostly.
