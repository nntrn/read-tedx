title: What's next in 3D printing
speaker: Avi Reichental
description: >-
 Just like his beloved grandfather, Avi Reichental is a maker of things. The
 difference is, now he can use 3D printers to make almost anything, out of almost
 any material. Reichental tours us through the possibilities of 3D printing, for
 everything from printed candy to highly custom sneakers.

My grandfather was a cobbler. Back in the day, he made custom-made shoes. I never got to
meet him. He perished in the Holocaust. But I did inherit his love for making, except that
it doesn't exist that much anymore. You see, while the Industrial Revolution did a great
deal to improve humanity, it eradicated the very skill that my grandfather loved, and it
atrophied craftsmanship as we know it. But all of that is about to change with 3D printing,
and it all started with this, the very first part that was ever printed. It's a little
older than TED. It was printed in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who invented 3D printing. But the
thing that I want to talk to you about today, the big idea that I want to discuss with
you, is not that 3D printing is going to catapult us into the future, but rather that it's
actually going to connect us with our heritage, and it's going to usher in a new era of
localized, distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication. So
think about useful things.

You all know your shoe size. How many of you know the size of the bridge of your nose or
the distance between your temples? Anybody? Wouldn't it be awesome if you could, for the
first time, get eyewear that actually fits you perfectly and doesn't require any hinge
assembly, so chances are, the hinges are not going to break? But the implications of 3D
printing go well beyond the tips of our noses. When I met Amanda for the first time, she
could already stand up and walk a little bit even though she was paralyzed from the waist
down, but she complained to me that her suit was uncomfortable. It was a beautiful robotic
suit made by Ekso Bionics, but it wasn't inspired by her body. It wasn't made to measure.
So she challenged me to make her something that was a little bit more feminine, a little
bit more elegant, and lightweight, and like good tailors, we thought that we would measure
her digitally. And we did.

We built her an amazing suit. The incredible part about what I learned from Amanda is a lot
of us are looking at 3D printing and we say to ourselves, it's going to replace
traditional methods. Amanda looked at it and she said, it's an opportunity for me to
reclaim my symmetry and to embrace my authenticity. And you know what? She's not standing
still. She now wants to walk in high heels. It doesn't stop there. 3D printing is changing
personalized medical devices as we know them, from new, beautiful, conformal, ventilated
scoliosis braces to millions of dental restorations and to beautiful bracings for
amputees, another opportunity to emotionally reconnect with your symmetry. And as we sit
here today, you can go wireless on your braces with clear aligners, or your dental
restorations. Millions of in-the-ear hearing aids are already 3D printed today. Millions
of people are served today from these devices.

What about full knee replacements, from your data, made to measure, where all of the tools
and guides are 3D printed? G.E. is using 3D printing to make the next generation LEAP
engine that will save fuel to the tune of about 15 percent and cost for an airline of
about 14 million dollars. Good for G.E., right? And their customers and the environment.
But, you know, the even better news is that this technology is no longer reserved for
deep-pocketed corporations. Planetary Resources, a startup for space explorations is going
to put out its first space probe later this year. It was a fraction of a NASA spaceship,
it costs a fraction of its cost, and it's made with less than a dozen moving parts, and
it's going to be out in space later this year. Google is taking on this very audacious
project of making the block phone, the Ara. It's only possible because of the development
of high-speed 3D printing that for the first time will make functional, usable modules
that will go into it.

A real moonshot, powered by 3D printing. How about food? What if we could, for the first
time, make incredible delectables like this beautiful TED Teddy here, that are edible?
What if we could completely change the experience, like you see with that absinthe serving
that is completely 3D printed? And what if we could begin to put ingredients and colors
and flavors in every taste, which means not only delicious foods but the promise of
personalized nutrition around the corner? And that gets me to one of the biggest deals
about 3D printing. With 3D printing, complexity is free. The printer doesn't care if it
makes the most rudimentary shape or the most complex shape, and that is completely turning
design and manufacturing on its head as we know it. Many people think that 3D printing
will be the end of manufacturing as we know it. I think that it's the opportunity to put
tomorrow's technology in the hands of youngsters that will create endless abundance of job
opportunities, and with that, everybody can become an expert maker and an expert
manufacturer.

That will take new tools. Not everybody knows how to use CAD, so we're developing haptics,
perceptual devices that will allow you to touch and feel your designs as if you play with
digital clay. When you do things like that, and we also developed things that take
physical photographs that are instantly printable, it will make it easier to create
content, but with all of the unimagined, we will also have the unintended, like
democratized counterfeiting and ubiquitous illegal possession. So many people ask me, will
we have a 3D printer in every home? I think it's the wrong question to ask. The right
question to ask is, how will 3D printing change my life? Or, in other words, what room in
my house will 3D printing fit in? So everything that you see here has been 3D printed,
including these shoes at the Amsterdam fashion show. Now, these are not my grandfather's
shoes. These are shoes that represent the continuation of his passion for hyper-local
manufacturing.

My grandfather didn't get to see Nike printing cleats for the recent Super Bowl, and my
father didn't get to see me standing in my hybridized 3D printed shoes. He passed away
three years ago. But Chuck Hull, the man that invented it all, is right here in the house
today, and thanks to him, I can say, thanks to his invention, I can say that I am a
cobbler too, and by standing in these shoes I am honoring my past while manufacturing the
future. Thank you.
