title: An urgent call to protect the world's "Third Pole"
speaker: Tshering Tobgay
description: >-
 The Hindu Kush Himalaya region is the world's third-largest repository of ice,
 after the North and South Poles -- and if current melting rates continue,
 two-thirds of its glaciers could be gone by the end of this century. What will
 happen if we let them melt away? Environmentalist and former Prime Minister of
 Bhutan Tshering Tobgay shares the latest from the "water towers of Asia," making
 an urgent call to create an intergovernmental agency to protect the glaciers --
 and save the nearly two billion people downstream from catastrophic flooding that
 would destroy land and livelihoods.

On the 17th of October, 2009, President Mohamed Nasheed of the Maldives did something
unusual. He held his cabinet meeting underwater. He literally took his ministers scuba
diving, as it were, to warn the world that his country could drown unless we control
global warming. Now I don't know whether he got his message across to the world or not, but
he certainly caught mine. I saw a political stunt. You see, I'm a politician, and I notice
these things. And let's be honest, the Maldives are distant from where I come from — my
country is Bhutan — so I didn't lose any sleep over their impending fate. Barely two months
later, I saw another political stunt. This time, the prime minister of Nepal, he held his
cabinet meeting on Mount Everest. He took all his ministers all the way up to the base
camp of Everest to warn the world that the Himalayan glaciers were melting. Now did that
worry me? You bet it did. I live in the Himalayas. But did I lose any sleep over his
message? No.

I wasn't ready to let a political stunt interfere with my beauty sleep.

Now fast-forward 10 years. In February this year, I saw this report. This here report
basically concludes that one-third of the ice on the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains could
melt by the end of the century. But that's only if, if we are able to contain global
warming to 1.5 degrees centigrade over preindustrial levels. Otherwise, if we can't, the
glaciers would melt much faster.1.5 degrees Celsius. "No way," I thought. Even the Paris
Agreement's ambitious targets aimed to limit global warming to two degrees centigrade. 1.5
degrees centigrade is what they call the best-case scenario. "Now this can't be true," I
thought. The Hindu Kush Himalaya region is the world's third-largest repository of ice,
after the North and South Poles. That's why we are also called the "Third Pole." There's a
lot of ice in the region. And yes, the glaciers, they are melting. We know that. I have
been to those in my country. I've seen them, and yes, they are melting. They are
vulnerable.

"But they can't be that vulnerable," I remember thinking. But what if they are? What if our
glaciers melt much more quickly than I anticipate? What if our glaciers are much more
vulnerable than previously thought? And what if, as a result, the glacial lakes — now
these are lakes that form when glaciers melt — what if those lakes burst under the weight
of additional water? And what if those floods cascade into other glacial lakes, creating
even bigger outbursts? That would create unprecedented flash floods in my country. That
would wreck my country. That would wreak havoc in my country. That would have the
potential to literally destroy our land, our livelihood, our way of life. So that report
caught my attention in ways that political stunts couldn't. It was put together by the
International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, or ICIMOD, which is based in
Nepal. Scientists and experts have studied our glaciers for decades, and their report kept
me awake at night, agonizing about the bad news and what it meant for my country and my
people.

So after several sleepless nights, I went to Nepal to visit ICIMOD.I found a team of
highly competent and dedicated scientists there, and here's what they told me. Number one:
the Hindu Kush Himalaya glaciers have been melting for some time now. Take that glacier,
for instance. It's on Mount Everest. As you can see, this once massive glacier has already
lost much of its ice. Number two: the glaciers are now melting much more quickly — so
quickly, in fact, that at just 1.5 degrees centigrade of global warming, one-third of the
glaciers would melt. At two degrees centigrade of global warming, half the glaciers would
disappear. And if current trends were to continue, a full two-thirds of our glaciers would
vanish. Number three: global warming means that our mountains receive more rain and less
snow ... and, unlike snowfall, rain melts ice, which just hurts the health of our
glaciers. Number four: pollution in the region has increased the amount of black carbon
that's deposited on our glaciers.

Black carbon is like soot. Black carbon absorbs heat and just accelerates the melting of
glaciers. To summarize, our glaciers are melting rapidly, and global warming is making them
melt much more quickly. But what does this mean? It means that the 240 million people who
live in the Hindu Kush Himalaya region — in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, China, Nepal,
Bangladesh, Myanmar and my own beloved country, Bhutan — these people will be directly
affected. When glaciers melt, when there's more rain and less snow, there will be huge
changes in the way water behaves. There will be more extremes: more intense rain, more
flash floods, more landslides, more glacial lake outburst floods. All this will cause
unimaginable destruction in a region that already has some of the poorest people on
earth. But it's not just the people in the immediate region who'll be affected. People
living downstream will also be hit hard.

That's because 10 of their major rivers originate in the Hindu Kush Himalaya mountains.
These rivers provide critical water for agriculture and drinking water to more than 1.6
billion people living downstream. That's one in five humans. That's why the Hindu Kush
Himalaya mountains are also called the "water towers of Asia."But when glaciers melt, when
monsoons turn severe, those rivers will obviously flood, so there will be deluges when
water is not required and droughts will be very common, when water is desperately
required. In short, Asia's water tower will be broken, and that will be disastrous for
one-fifth of humanity. Should the rest of the world care? Should you, for instance, care?
Remember, I didn't care when I heard that the Maldives could disappear underwater. And
that is the crux of the problem, isn't it? We don't care. We don't care until we are
personally affected. I mean, we know. We know climate change is real. We know that we face
drastic and dramatic change.

We know that it is coming fast. Yet most of us act as if everything were normal. So we
must care, all of us, and if you can't care for those who are affected by the melting of
glaciers, you should at least care for yourself. That's because the Hindu Kush Himalaya
mountains — the entire region is like the pulse of the planet. If the region falls sick,
the entire planet will eventually suffer. And right now, with our glaciers melting
rapidly, the region is not just sick — it is crying out for help. And how will it affect
the rest of the world? One obvious scenario is the potential destabilization caused by
tens of millions of climate refugees, who'll be forced to move because they have no or
little water, or because their livelihoods have been destroyed by the melting of glaciers.
Another scenario we can't take lightly is the potential of conflict over water and the
political destabilization in a region that has three nuclear powers: China, India,
Pakistan. I believe that the situation in our region is grave enough to warrant the
creation of a new intergovernmental agency.

So as a native from that part of the world, I want to propose here, today, the
establishment of the Third Pole Council, a high-level, intergovernmental organization
tasked with the singular responsibility of protecting the world's third-largest repository
of ice. A Third Pole Council would consist of all eight countries located in the region as
member countries, as equal member countries, and could also include representative
organizations and other countries who have vested interests in the region as non-voting
members. But the big idea is to get all stakeholders together to work together. To work
together to monitor the health of the glaciers; to work together to shape and implement
policies to protect our glaciers, and, by extension, to protect the billions of people who
depend on our glaciers. We have to work together, because thinking globally, acting locally
... does not work. We've tried that in Bhutan. We've made immense sacrifices to act
locally ...

and while individual localized efforts will continue to be important, they cannot stand up
to the onslaught of climate change. To stand up to climate change, we must work together.
We must think globally and act regionally. Our entire region must come together, to work
together, to fight climate change together, to make our voices heard together. And that
includes India and China. They must step up their game. They must take the ownership of
the fight to protect our glaciers. And for that, these two countries, these two powerful
giants, must reduce their own greenhouse gases, control their pollution, and lead the
fight. Lead the global fight against climate change. And all that with a renewed sense of
urgency. Only then — and that, too, only maybe — will our region and other regions that
depend on our glaciers have any chance to avoid major catastrophes. Time is running out. We
must act together, now.

Otherwise, the next time Nepal's cabinet meets on Mount Everest, that spectacular backdrop
... may look quite different. And if that happens, if our glaciers melt, rising sea levels
could well drown the Maldives. And while they can hold their cabinet meetings underwater
to send an SOS to the world, their country can keep existing only if their islands keep
existing. The Maldives are still distant, away. Their islands are distant from where I
live. But now, I pay close attention to what happens out there. Thank you very
much.
