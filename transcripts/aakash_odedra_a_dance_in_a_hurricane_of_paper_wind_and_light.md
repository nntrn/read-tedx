title: A dance in a hurricane of paper, wind and light
speaker: Aakash Odedra
description: >-
 Choreographer Aakash Odedra is dyslexic and has always felt that his best
 expression comes through movement. “Murmur” is his ode to that experience,
 teaming up with co-creators Lewis Major and Ars Electronica Futurelab. Watch him
 spin his way through the center of a storm, as pages of books take flight all
 around him.
