Everything is interconnected. As a Shinnecock Indian, I was raised to know this. We are a
small fishing tribe situated on the southeastern tip of Long Island near the town of
Southampton in New York. When I was a little girl, my grandfather took me to sit outside in
the sun on a hot summer day. There were no clouds in the sky. And after a while I began to
perspire. And he pointed up to the sky, and he said, "Look, do you see that? That's part
of you up there. That's your water that helps to make the cloud that becomes the rain that
feeds the plants that feeds the animals."In my continued exploration of subjects in nature
that have the ability to illustrate the interconnection of all life, I started storm
chasing in 2008 after my daughter said, "Mom, you should do that."And so three days later,
driving very fast, I found myself stalking a single type of giant cloud called the super
cell, capable of producing grapefruit-size hail and spectacular tornadoes, although only
two percent actually do.

These clouds can grow so big, up to 50 miles wide and reach up to 65,000 feet into the
atmosphere. They can grow so big, blocking all daylight, making it very dark and ominous
standing under them. Storm chasing is a very tactile experience. There's a warm, moist wind
blowing at your back and the smell of the earth, the wheat, the grass, the charged
particles. And then there are the colors in the clouds of hail forming, the greens and the
turquoise blues. I've learned to respect the lightning. My hair used to be
straight.

I'm just kidding.

What really excites me about these storms is their movement, the way they swirl and spin
and undulate, with their lava lamp-like mammatus clouds. They become lovely monsters. When
I'm photographing them, I cannot help but remember my grandfather's lesson. As I stand
under them, I see not just a cloud, but understand that what I have the privilege to
witness is the same forces, the same process in a small-scale version that helped to
create our galaxy, our solar system, our sun and even this very planet. All my relations.
Thank you.
