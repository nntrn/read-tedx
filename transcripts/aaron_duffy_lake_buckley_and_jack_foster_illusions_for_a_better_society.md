Narrator: We have you here today specifically to try and learn a little bit about how the
brain processes visual illusions. Wei Ji Ma: My name is Wei Ji Ma. I'm a professor of
neuroscience and psychology at New York University. N: Great. WJM: Our research focuses
mostly on perception and decision-making. What's out there in the world, the brain has no
idea, but it's trying to do its best to figure it out. And even though that process is
pretty sophisticated, sometimes it goes wrong.(Glass breaks)The first step is that light
enters your eyes. Just from the table or from the coffee cup, you get an image in your
eye, but the hard work only starts after that. Very often, the incoming signals are not
complete and they're not perfect, and your brain has to make sense of them. There are
cases where this inference process goes wrong, and that's when you have a visual
illusion. N: Can visual illusions be proof that our brains make similar mistakes about
other things, for example, in the areas of politics, economics or religion? WJM: I probably
don't want to go that far, but there's a metaphor there.

It's good to consider other points of view. It's good to consider your own certainty.
Illusions are merely a window in this kind of processing that's going on all the time,
where our brain builds beliefs of what might be happening in the world. N: What if we
looked at a different illusion every day as a reminder that our brains can be wrong about
the things we are most certain about? WJM: As a scientist, I wouldn't be able to tell you
that that's going to work, but it sounds like an interesting idea. You should try it and
let me know how it goes.

Sorry, can I do that again?
