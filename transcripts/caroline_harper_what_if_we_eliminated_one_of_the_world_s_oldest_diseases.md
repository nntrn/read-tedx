title: What if we eliminated one of the world's oldest diseases?
speaker: Caroline Harper
description: >-
 Thousands of years ago, ancient Nubians drew pictures on tomb walls of a terrible
 disease that turns the eyelids inside out and causes blindness. This disease,
 trachoma, is still a scourge in many parts of the world today -- but it's also
 completely preventable, says Caroline Harper. Armed with data from a global
 mapping project, Harper's organization Sightsavers has a plan: to focus on
 countries where funding gaps stand in the way of eliminating the disease and ramp
 up efforts where the need is most severe. Learn more about their goal of
 consigning trachoma to the history books -- and how you can help. (This ambitious
 idea is part of the Audacious Project, TED's initiative to inspire and fund
 global change.)

I'd like you to imagine, just for a moment, that your eyelashes grew inwards instead of
outwards, so that every time you blinked, they would scrape the front of your eyeballs,
damaging the corneas, so that slowly and painfully, you went blind. Well, that's what
happens to a person who has trachoma. Now, this little boy here, Pamelo, from Zambia, he
has trachoma. And if we don't do anything, he's going to go blind. Trachoma is a curious
disease. It's a bacterial infection that's passed from person to person and by flies. The
repeated infection will scar your eyelids so that they contract and they turn inside out.
It particularly affects women, because they have the contact with children. So what you'll
often see in places like Ethiopia are girls who have tweezers like this around their
necks, and they use them to pluck out their eyelashes. But of course, that only gives them
temporary respite, because they just grow back more vicious than before. There are around
two million people in the world who are blind or visually impaired because of
trachoma.

And we believe there may be as many as 200 million people who are at risk. Now, it's a very
old disease. What you can see is a photo of a wall of a tomb in Northern Sudan. A
colleague and I were traveling in a very remote village, and we asked an old man to take
us down into a little tomb. Now, on the wall, we saw two eyes. One is crying, and you can
see there are tweezers next to it. Simon said to me, "My God, do you think that's
trachoma?" So we sent this picture to the British Museum, and they confirmed that, yes,
this is trachoma. So, thousands of years ago, the ancient Nubians were painting pictures
of trachoma on the walls of their tomb. And the tragedy is that disease is still rampant
in that area today. And the crazy thing is, we know how to stop it. And what's great is
that the trachoma community have all come together to pool their efforts. We don't
compete; we collaborate. I have to tell you, that's not always the case in my experience in
the NGO world.

We've created something called the International Coalition for Trachoma Control. And
together, we've developed a strategy to fight it. This strategy is called the SAFE
strategy, and it's been approved by the World Health Organization. The "S" stands for
"surgery." It's very straightforward procedure to turn the eyelids back the right way. We
train nurses to do it, and they use local anesthetics. And as you can see, you can do it
in somebody's front porch, if need be. Then "A" stands for "antibiotics." These are donated
by Pfizer, who also pay for those drugs to be transported to the port in-country. From
there, they're taken to the villages, where hundreds of thousands of community volunteers
will distribute those drugs to the people. Now, we train those volunteers, and we also
help the ministries with all that complex logistics. And every one of those volunteers has
a pole like this. It's called a "dose pole." This one's from Cameroon.

And you can see it's marked different colors, and you can tell how many pills you should
give somebody, based on how tall they are."F" stands for "face washing." Now, we used to
have trachoma in the UK and in the US. In fact, President Carter, he talks about how
trachoma was a real problem in Georgia when he was a little boy. And in the UK, the famous
eye hospital, Moorfields, was originally a trachoma hospital. What we do is teach kids
like this how important it is to wash their faces. And finally, "E" stands for
"environment," where we help the communities build latrines, and we teach them to separate
their animals from their living quarters in order to reduce the fly population. So we know
how to tackle the disease. But we need to know where it is. And we do, because a few years
ago, Sightsavers led an incredible program called the Global Trachoma Mapping Project. It
took us three years, but we went through 29 countries, and we taught local health workers
to go district by district, and they examined the eyelids of over two and a half million
people.

And they used Android phones in order to download the data. And from that, we were able to
build a map that showed us where the disease was. Now, this is a very high-level map that
shows you which countries had a problem with trachoma. And you may ask me, "Well, does this
strategy actually work?" Yes, it does. This map shows you the progress that we've made to
date. The green countries believe they've already eliminated trachoma, and they have
either been through or are in the process of having that validated by the WHO. Countries
in yellow have the money they need, they have the resources to eliminate trachoma. And
some of them are really nearly there. But the red countries, they don't have enough
funding. They cannot eliminate trachoma unless they get more. And we're quite concerned,
though, that the progress to date may stall. So when we were talking to the Audacious ideas
guys, we asked ourselves: If we really, really pushed ourselves over the next four or five
years and we had the money, what do we think we could achieve? Well, we believe that we can
eliminate trachoma in 12 African countries and across the Americas and all across the
Pacific.

And we can make significant progress in two countries which have the highest burden of the
disease, which is Ethiopia and Nigeria. And in doing all of that, we can leverage more
than two billion dollars' worth of donated drugs.

Now, this map here shows you the impact that we'll have — look how many countries are
going green. And there, you can see progress in Ethiopia and Nigeria. Now, yes, there are
some countries that are still red. These are mainly countries which are in conflict —
places like Yemen, South Sudan — where it's very difficult to work. So, we have the team,
the strategy and the map. And we also have the relationships with the governments so that
we can make sure that our program is coordinated with other disease-control programs, so
that we can be efficient. Wouldn't it be amazing if we could do this? We'd have trachoma
on the run. We would be on the home straight to eliminate this disease from the whole
world. But before I finish, I just want to share with you some words from the founder of
Sightsavers, a guy called Sir John Wilson. Now, he was blinded at the age of 12. And he
said, "People don't go blind by the million.

They go blind one by one." And in the excitement of being able to say we've got rid of
trachoma for the whole country, let's not forget that, actually, this is a devastating
disease that destroys the lives of individual people. People like Twiba. Now, I met Twiba
last year in Tanzania. She had had trachoma for as long as she could remember. And a
couple of months before I met her, she'd had the operation. It's no exaggeration to say
that this had totally transformed her life. We'd saved the sight that she had left, and
she was free of pain. She could sleep. She could work, she could socialize. And she said
to me, "I have my life back." And it was impossible not to be moved by her story. But
there are so many Twibas. I want to find all the Twibas, and I don't want anyone to go
blind in agony anymore. Now, you know, there are so many intractable problems in this
world. But this is not one of them. This is something that we can solve.

And we can ensure that kids like this can grow up free from the fear of trachoma. So, for
the sake of kids like this, and for the sake of people like Twiba, let's get rid of
trachoma. Do you think we can? Well, yeah, if we really, really want to. Yes, we can. So
thank you.
