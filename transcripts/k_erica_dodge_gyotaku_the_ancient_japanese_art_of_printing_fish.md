title: Gyotaku: The ancient Japanese art of printing fish
speaker: K. Erica Dodge
description: >-
 How did fishermen record their trophy catches before the invention of photography?
 In 19th century Japan, fishing boats were equipped with rice paper, sumi-e ink,
 and brushes in order to create gyotaku: elaborate rubbings of freshly caught
 fish. K. Erica Dodge recounts the story of this competitive fishing culture, plus
 some tips on how to make your very own etchings. [Directed by Franco Barroeta,
 narrated by Michelle Snow].

How big was that fish you caught? This big? This big? This big? Without photographic
evidence, there's nothing that proves you caught a whopper, and that's been true since the
dawn of fishing. In fact, hundreds of years ago, long before photography could capture the
moment, Japanese fishermen invented their own way to record trophy catches. They called it
Gyotaku. Gyotaku is the ancient art of printing fish that originated in Japan as a way to
record trophy catches prior to the modern day camera. Gyo means fish and taku means
impression. There are several different stories about how Gyotaku came about, but it
basically started with fishermen needing a way to record the species and size of the fish
they caught over 100 years ago. Fishermen took paper, ink, and brushes out to sea with
them. They told stories of great adventures at sea. Since the Japanese revered certain
fish, the fishermen would take a rubbing from these fish and release them.

To make the rubbing, they would paint the fish with non-toxic sumi-e ink and print them on
rice paper. This way they could be released or cleaned and sold at market. The first
prints like this were for records only with no extra details. It wasn't until the mid
1800's that they began painting eye details and other embellishments onto the prints. One
famous nobleman, Lord Sakai, was an avid fisherman, and, when he made a large catch, he
wanted to preserve the memory of the large, red sea bream. To do so, he commissioned a
fisherman to print his catch. After this, many fisherman would bring their Gyotaku prints
to Lord Sakai, and if he liked their work, he would hire them to print for him. Many
prints hung in the palace during the Edo period. After this period, Gyotaku was not as
popular and began to fade away. Today, Gyotaku has become a popular art form, enjoyed by
many. And the prints are said to bring good luck to the fishermen. But the art form is
quite different than it used to be.

Most artists today learn on their own by trial and error. Before the artist begins to
print, the fish needs to be prepared for printing. First, the artist places the fish on a
hollowed out surface. Then the artist spreads the fins out and pins them down on the board
to dry. They then clean the fish with water. When it comes time to print, there are two
different methods. The indirect method begins with pasting moist fabric or paper onto the
fish using rice paste. Then, the artist uses a tompo, or a cotton ball covered in silk, to
put ink on the fabric or paper to produce the print. This method requires more skill and
great care needs to be taken when pulling the paper off the fish so the paper doesn't
tear. In the direct method, the artist paints directly on the fish, and then gently
presses the moist fabric or paper into the fish. With both of these methods, no two prints
are exactly alike, but both reveal dramatic images of the fish.

For the final touch, the artist uses a chop, or a stamp, and signs their work, and can
hold it up to say, "The fish was exactly this big!"
