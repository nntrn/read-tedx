Angella Ahn: Thank you. 

Thank you so much. We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen, sharing our music with you.
 What an exciting and inspiring event. What you just heard is "Skylife" by David
Balakrishnan. We want to play you one more selection. It's by Astor Piazzolla, an
Argentine composer. And we talk about different ideas â€” he had this idea that he thought
music should be from the heart. This was in the middle of the 20th century when music
from the heart, beautiful music, wasn't the most popular thing in the classical music
world. It was more atonal and twelve-tone. And he insisted on beautiful music. So this
is "Oblivion" by Astor Piazzolla. Thank you.
