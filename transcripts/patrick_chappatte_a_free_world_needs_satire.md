title: A free world needs satire
speaker: Patrick Chappatte
description: >-
 We need humor like we need the air we breathe, says editorial cartoonist Patrick
 Chappatte. In a talk illustrated with highlights from a career spent skewering
 everything from dictators and ideologues to selfies and social media mobs,
 Chappatte makes a resounding, often hilarious case for the necessity of satire.
 "Political cartoons were born with democracy, and they are challenged when
 freedom is," he says.

I've been a political cartoonist on the global stage for the last 20 years. Hey, we have
seen a lot of things happen in those 20 years. We saw three different Catholic popes, and
we witnessed that unique moment: the election of a pope on St. Peter's Square — you know,
the little white smoke and the official announcement. [It's a boy!]

We saw four American presidents. Obama, of course. Oh, Europeans liked him a lot. He was a
multilateralist. He favored diplomacy. He wanted to be friends with Iran.

And then ... reality imitated caricature the day Donald Trump became the President of the
United States of America.

You know, people come to us and they say, "It's too easy for you cartoonists. I mean —
with people like Trump?" Well, no, it's not easy to caricature a man who is himself a
caricature.

No.

Populists are no easy target for satire because you try to nail them down one day, and the
next day, they outdo you. For example, as soon as he was elected, I tried to imagine the
tweet that Trump would send on Christmas Eve. So I did this, OK?[Merry Christmas to all!
Except all those pathetic losers. So sad.]

And basically, the next day, Trump tweeted this:[Happy New Year to all, including to my
many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to
do. Love!]

It's the same!

This is the era of strongmen. And soon, Donald Trump was able to meet his personal hero,
Vladimir Putin, and this is how the first meeting went:[I'll help you find the hackers.
Give me your password.]

And I'm not inventing anything. He came out of that first meeting saying that the two of
them had agreed on a joint task force on cybersecurity. This is true, if you do
remember. Oh, who would have imagined the things we saw over these 20 years. We saw Great
Britain run towards a European Union exit.[Hard Brexit?]

In the Middle East, we believed for a while in the democratic miracle of the Arab Spring.
We saw dictators fall, we saw others hang on.

And then there is the timeless Kim dynasty of North Korea. These guys seem to be coming
straight out of Cartoon Network. I was blessed to be able to draw two of them. Kim
Jong-il, the father, when he died a few years ago, that was a very dangerous moment.[That
was close!]

That was —

And then the son, Kim Jong-un, proved himself a worthy successor to the throne. He's now
friends with the US president. They meet each other all the time, and they talk like
friends.[What kind of hair gel?]

Should we be surprised to be living in a world ruled by egomaniacs? What if they were just
a reflection of ourselves? I mean, look at us, each of us.

Yeah, we love our smartphones; we love our selfies; we love ourselves. And thanks to
Facebook, we have a lot of friends all over the world. Mark Zuckerberg is our
friend.

You know, he and his peers in Silicon Valley are the kings and the emperors of our time.
Showing that the emperors have no clothes, that's the task of satire, right? Speaking
truth to power. This has always been the historical role of political cartooning. In the
1830s, postrevolutionary France under King Louis Philippe, journalists and caricaturists
fought hard for the freedom of the press. They were jailed, they were fined, but they
prevailed. And this caricature of the king by Daumier came to define the monarch. It
marked history. It became the timeless symbol of satire triumphing over autocracy. Today,
200 years after Daumier, are political cartoons at risk of disappearing? Take this blank
space on the front page of Turkish opposition newspaper "Cumhuriyet." This is where Musa
Kart's cartoon used to appear. In 2018, Musa Kart was sentenced to three years in jail.
For doing what? For doing political cartoons in Erdoğan's Turkey.

Cartoonists from Venezuela, Russia, Syria have been forced into exile. Look at this image.
It seems so innocent, right? Yet it is so provocative. When he posted this image, Hani
Abbas knew it would change his life. It was in 2012, and the Syrians were taking to the
streets. Of course, the little red flower is the symbol of the Syrian revolution. So
pretty soon, the regime was after him, and he had to flee the country. A good friend of
his, cartoonist Akram Raslan, didn't make it out of Syria. He died under torture. In the
United States of America recently, some of the very top cartoonists, like Nick Anderson
and Rob Rogers — this is a cartoon by Rob —[Memorial Day 2018. (on tombstone) Truth.
Honor. Rule of Law.]they lost their positions because their publishers found their work
too critical of Trump. And the same happened to Canadian cartoonist Michael de Adder. Hey,
maybe we should start worrying.

Political cartoons were born with democracy, and they are challenged when freedom is. You
know, over the years, with the Cartooning for Peace Foundation and other initiatives, Kofi
Annan — this is not well known — he was the honorary chair of our foundation, the late
Kofi Annan, Nobel Peace Laureate. He was a great defender of cartoons. Or, on the board of
the Association of American Editorial Cartoonists, we have advocated on behalf of jailed,
threatened, fired, exiled cartoonists. But I never saw a case of someone losing his job
over a cartoon he didn't do. Well, that happened to me. For the last 20 years, I have been
with the "International Herald Tribune" and the "New York Times." Then something happened.
In April 2019, a cartoon by a famous Portuguese cartoonist, which was first published in a
newspaper "El Expresso" in Lisbon, was picked by an editor at the "New York Times" and
reprinted in the international editions. This thing blew up.

It was denounced as anti-Semitic, triggered widespread outrage, apologies and a lot of
damage control by the Times. A month after, my editor told me they were ending political
cartoons altogether. So we could, and we should, have a discussion about that cartoon. Some
people say it reminds them of the worst anti-Semitic propaganda. Others, including in
Israel, say no, it's just a harsh criticism of Trump, who is shown as blindly following
the Prime Minister of Israel. I have some issues with this cartoon, but that discussion
did not happen at the "New York Times." Under attack, they took the easiest path: in order
to not have problems with political cartoons in the future, let's not have any at all. Hey,
this is new. Did we just invent preventive self-censorship? I think this is bigger than
cartoons. This is about opinion and journalism. This, in the end, is about democracy. We
now live in a world where moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a
storm.

The most outraged voices tend to define the conversation, and the angry crowd follows in.
These social media mobs, sometimes fueled by interest groups, fall upon newsrooms in an
overwhelming blow. They send publishers and editors scrambling for countermeasures. This
leaves no room for meaningful discussions. Twitter is a place for fury, not for debate. And
you know what? Someone described pretty well our human condition in this noisy age. You
know who? Shakespeare, 400 years ago.["(Life is) a tale told by an idiot, full of sound
and fury, signifying nothing."]This speaks to me. Shakespeare is still very relevant, no?
But the world has changed a bit.[Too long!]

It's true.

You know, social media is both a blessing and a curse for cartoons. This is the era of the
image, so they get shared, they get viral, but that also makes them a prime target. More
than often, the real target behind the cartoon is the media that published it.[Covering
Iraq? No, Trump!]That relationship between traditional media and social media is a funny
one. On one hand, you have the time-consuming process of information, verification,
curation. On the other hand, it's an open buffet, frankly, for rumors, opinions, emotions,
amplified by algorithms. Even quality newspapers mimic the codes of social networks on
their websites. They highlight the 10 most read, the 10 most shared stories. They should
put forward the 10 most important stories.

The media must not be intimidated by social media, and editors should stop being afraid of
the angry mob.

We're not going to put up warnings the way we do on cigarette packs, are we?[Satire can
hurt your feelings]

Come on.[Under your burkini you could be hiding a sex bomb]Political cartoons are meant to
provoke, just like opinions. But before all, they are meant to be thought-provoking. You
feel hurt? Just let it go. You don't like it? Look the other way. Freedom of expression is
not incompatible with dialogue and listening to each other. But it is incompatible with
intolerance.

Let us not become our own censors in the name of political correctness. We need to stand
up, we need to push back, because if we don't, we will wake up tomorrow in a sanitized
world, where any form of satire and political cartooning becomes impossible. Because, when
political pressure meets political correctness, freedom of speech perishes.

Do you remember January 2015? With the massacre of journalists and cartoonists at "Charlie
Hebdo" in Paris, we discovered the most extreme form of censorship: murder. Remember how
it felt.[Without humor we are all dead]Whatever one thought of that satirical magazine,
however one felt about those particular cartoons, we all sensed that something fundamental
was at stake, that citizens of free societies — actually, citizens of any society — need
humor as much as the air we breathe. This is why the extremists, the dictators, the
autocrats and, frankly, all the ideologues of the world cannot stand humor. In the insane
world we live in right now, we need political cartoons more than ever. And we need
humor. Thank you.
