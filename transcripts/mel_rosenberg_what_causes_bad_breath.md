There is a curse that has plagued humanity since ancient times. The Greeks fought it by
chewing aromatic resins, while the Chinese resorted to egg shells. In the ancient Jewish
Talmud, it's even considered legal grounds for divorce. This horrible scourge is
halitosis, otherwise known as bad breath. But what causes it, and why is it so universally
terrifying? Well, think of some of the worst odors you can imagine, like garbage, feces or
rotting meat. All of these smells come from the activity of microorganisms, particularly
bacteria, and, as disgusting as it may sound, similar bacteria live in the moisture-rich
environment of your mouth. Don't panic. The presence of bacteria in your body is not only
normal, it's actually vital for all sorts of things, like digestion and disease
prevention. But like all living things, bacteria need to eat. The bacteria in your mouth 
feed off of mucus, food remnants, and dead tissue cells.

In order to absorb nutrients through their cell membranes, they must break down the
organic matter into much smaller molecules. For example, they'll break proteins into
their component amino acids and then break those down even further into various compounds.
Some of the foul-smelling byproducts of these reactions, such as hydrogen sulfide and
cadaverine, escape into the air and waft their way towards unsuspecting noses. Our
sensitivity to these odors and interpretation of them as bad smells may be an evolutionary
mechanism warning us of rotten food and the presence of disease. Smell is one of our most
intimate and primal senses, playing a huge role in our attraction to potential mates. In
one poll, 59% of men and 70% of women said they wouldn't go on a date with someone who
has bad breath, which may be why Americans alone spend $1 billion a year on various
breath products. Fortunately, most bad breath is easily treated.

The worst smelling byproducts come from gram-negative bacteria that live in the spaces 
between gums and teeth and on the back of the tongue. By brushing and flossing our teeth,
using antibacterial mouthwash at bedtime, gently cleaning the back of the tongue with a
plastic scraper and even just eating a healthy breakfast, we can remove many of these
bacteria and their food sources. In some cases, these measures may not be enough due to
dental problems, nasal conditions, or rarer ailments, such as liver disease and
uncontrolled diabetes. Behaviors like smoking and excessive alcohol consumption also have
a very recognizable odor. Regardless of cause, the bad smell almost always originates in
the mouth and not the stomach or elsewhere in the body. But one of the biggest challenges
lies in actually determining how our breath smells in the first place, and it's unclear
why. It may be that we're too acclimatized to the smell inside our own mouths to judge
it.

And methods like cupping your hands over your mouth, or licking and smelling your wrist
don't work perfectly either. One study showed that even when people do this, they tend to
rate the smell subjectively according to how bad they thought it was going to be. But
there's one simple, if socially difficult, way of finding out how your breath smells: just
take a deep breath and ask a friend.
