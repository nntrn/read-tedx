title: The difference between classical and operant conditioning
speaker: Peggy Andover
description: >-
 Why is it that humans react to stimuli with certain behaviors? Can behaviors
 change in response to consequences? Peggy Andover explains how the brain can
 associate unrelated stimuli and responses proved by Ivan Pavlov's famous 1890
 experiments and how reinforcement and punishment can result in changed behavior.

When we think about learning, we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall,
books open on their desks, listening intently to a teacher or professor in the front of
the room. But in psychology, learning means something else. To psychologists, learning is
a long-term change in behavior that's based on experience. Two of the main types of
learning are called classical conditioning and operant, or instrumental, conditioning.
Let's talk about classical conditioning first. In the 1890's, a Russian physiologist named
Ivan Pavlov did some really famous experiments on dogs. He showed dogs some food and rang
a bell at the same time. After a while, the dogs would associate the bell with the food.
They would learn that when they heard the bell, they would get fed. Eventually, just
ringing the bell made the dogs salivate. They learned to expect food at the sound of a
bell. You see, under normal conditions, the sight and smell of food causes a dog to
salivate.

We call the food an unconditioned stimulus, and we call salivation the unconditioned
response. Nobody trains a dog to salivate over some steak. However, when we pair an
unconditioned stimulus like food with something that was previously neutral, like the
sound of a bell, that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus. And so classical
conditioning was discovered. We see how this works with animals, but how does it work with
humans? In exactly the same way. Let's say that one day you go to the doctor to get a
shot. She says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit," and then gives you the most painful
shot you've ever had. A few weeks later you go to the dentist for a check-up. He starts to
put a mirror in your mouth to examine your teeth, and he says, "Don't worry, this won't
hurt a bit." Even though you know the mirror won't hurt, you jump out of the chair and
run, screaming from the room.

When you went to get a shot, the words, "This won't hurt a bit," became a conditioned
stimulus when they were paired with pain of the shot, the unconditioned stimulus, which
was followed by your conditioned response of getting the heck out of there. Classical
conditioning in action. Operant conditioning explains how consequences lead to changes in
voluntary behavior. So how does operant conditioning work? There are two main components
in operant conditioning: reinforcement and punishment. Reinforcers make it more likely
that you'll do something again, while punishers make it less likely. Reinforcement and
punishment can be positive or negative, but this doesn't mean good and bad. Positive means
the addition of a stimulus, like getting dessert after you finish your veggies, and
negative means the removal of a stimulus, like getting a night of no homework because you
did well on an exam. Let's look at an example of operant conditioning.

After eating dinner with your family, you clear the table and wash the dishes. When you're
done, your mom gives you a big hug and says, "Thank you for helping me." In this
situation, your mom's response is positive reinforcement if it makes you more likely to
repeat the operant response, which is to clear the table and wash the dishes. Operant
conditioning is everywhere in our daily lives. There aren't many things we do that haven't
been influenced at some point by operant conditioning. We even see operant conditioning in
some extraordinary situations. One group of scientists showed the power of operant
conditioning by teaching pigeons to be art connoisseurs. Using food as a positive
reinforcer, scientists have taught pigeons to select paintings by Monet over those by
Picasso. When showed works of other artists, scientists observed stimulus generalization
as the pigeons chose the Impressionists over the Cubists.

Maybe next they'll condition the pigeons to paint their own masterpieces.
