In the mid-19th century, suspension bridges were collapsing all across Europe. Their
industrial cables frayed during turbulent weather and snapped under the weight of their
decks. So when a German-American engineer named John Roebling proposed building the
largest and most expensive suspension bridge ever conceived over New York’s East River,
city officials were understandably skeptical. But Manhattan was increasingly
overcrowded, and commuters from Brooklyn clogged the river. In February of 1867, the
government approved Roebling’s proposal. To avoid the failures of European bridges,
Roebling designed a hybrid bridge model. From suspension bridges, he incorporated large
cables supported by central pillars and anchored at each bank. This design was ideal for
supporting long decks, which hung from smaller vertical cables. But Roebling’s model also
drew from cable-stayed bridges.

These shorter structures held up their decks with diagonal cables that ran directly to
support towers. By adding these additional cables, Roebling improved the bridge’s
stability, while also reducing the weight on its anchor cables. Similar designs had been
used for some other bridges but the scope of Roebling’s plan here dwarfed them all. His
new bridge’s deck spanned over 480 meters— 1.5 times longer than any previously built
suspension bridge. Since standard hemp rope would tear under the deck’s 14,680 tons, his
proposal called for over 5,600 kilometers of metal wire to create the bridge’s cables. To
support all this weight, the towers would need to stand over 90 meters above sea level—
making them the tallest structures in the Western Hemisphere. Roebling was confident his
design would work, but while surveying the site in 1869, an incoming boat crushed his
foot against the dock. Within a month, tetanus had claimed his life.

Fortunately, John Roebling's son, Washington, was also a trained engineer and took over
his father’s role. The following year, construction on the tower foundations finally
began. This first step in construction was also the most challenging. Building on the
rocky river bed involved the use of a largely untested technology: pneumatic caissons.
Workers lowered these airtight wooden boxes into the river, where a system of pipes
pumped pressurized air in and water out. Once established, air locks allowed workers to
enter the chamber and excavate the river bottom. They placed layers of stone on top of
the caisson as they dug. When it finally hit the bedrock, they filled it with concrete,
becoming the tower’s permanent foundation. Working conditions in these caissons were
dismal and dangerous. Lit only by candles and gas lamps, the chambers caught fire several
times, forcing them to be evacuated and flooded. Even more dangerous was a mysterious
ailment called "the bends." Today, we understand this as decompression sickness, but at
the time, it appeared to be an unexplainable pain or dizziness that killed several
workmen.

In 1872, it nearly claimed the life of the chief engineer. Washington survived, but was
left paralyzed and bedridden. Yet once again, the Roeblings proved indomitable.
Washington’s wife Emily not only carried communications between her husband and the
engineers, but soon took over day-to-day project management. Unfortunately, the bridge’s
troubles were far from over. By 1877, construction was over budget and behind schedule.
Worse still, it turned out the bridge’s cable contractor had been selling them faulty
wires. This would have been a fatal flaw if not for the abundant failsafes in John
Roebling’s design. After reinforcing the cables with additional wires, they suspended the
deck piece by piece. It took 14 years, the modern equivalent of over 400 million dollars,
and the life’s work of three different Roeblings, but when the Brooklyn Bridge finally
opened on May 24, 1883, its splendor was undeniable.

Today, the Brooklyn Bridge still stands atop its antique caissons, supporting the gothic
towers and intersecting cables that frame a gateway to New York City.
