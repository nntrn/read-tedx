title: An antihero of one's own
speaker: Tim Adams
description: >-
 How can an antihero teach us about the heroic-- and sometimes, the unheroic--
 characteristics that shape a story's protagonist? From jealousy to self-doubt,
 Tim Adams challenges us to consider how antiheroes reflect the very mortal
 weaknesses that can be found within all of us. [Directed by Tahnee Gehm, narrated
 by Zach Tolchinsky].

Literary critic Northrop Frye once observed that in our primitive days, our literary
heroes were — well, nearly gods, and as civilization advanced, they came down the mountain
of the gods, so to speak, and became more human, more flawed, less heroic. From the divine
heroes like Hercules, down the mountain below the miraculous but mortal heroes such as
Beowulf, the great leaders such as King Arthur, and the great but flawed heroes like
Macbeth or Othello. Below even the unlikely but eventual heroes such as Harry Potter, Luke
Skywalker, or Hiccup, until we reach the bottom and meet the anti-hero. Contrary to the
sound, the anti-hero is not the villain, not the antagonist. The anti-hero is actually the
main character in some contemporary works of literature. Guy Montag in "Fahrenheit 451,"
Winston Smith in "1984," who unwittingly ends up challenging those in power — that is,
those who abuse their power to brainwash the populace to believe that the ills of society
have been eliminated.

Ideally, those who challenge the establishment should be wise, confident, brave,
physically strong, with a type of charisma that inpires followers. The anti-hero, however,
at best demonstrates a few underdeveloped traits, at worst, is totally inept. The story of
the anti-hero usually unfolds something like this. The anti-hero initially conforms,
ignorantly accepting the established views, a typical, unquestioning, brainwashed member
of society. The anti-hero struggles to conform, all the while starting to object, perhaps
finding other outsiders with whom to voice his questions, and naïvely, unwisely, sharing
those questions with an authority figure. The anti-hero openly challenges society, and
tries to fight against the lies and tactics used to oppress the populace. This step, for
the anti-hero, is seldom a matter of brave, wise and heroic opposition. Maybe the
anti-hero fights and succeeds in destroying the oppressive government, with a lot of
impossible luck.

Perhaps he or she runs away, escapes to fight another day. All too often though, the
anti-hero is killed, or brainwashed to return to conformity with the masses. No heroic
triumph here, no brave individual standing up against impersonal institutions of a modern
world, inspiring others to fight, or resourcefully outwitting and outgunning the massive
army of the evil empire. Our storytelling ancestors calmed our fears of powerlessness by
giving us Hercules and other heroes strong enough to fight off the demons and monsters
that we suspected haunted the night beyond our campfires. But eventually, we realized the
monsters did not lie out there, they reside inside of us. Beowulf's greatest enemy was
mortality. Othello's, jealousy. Hiccup, self-doubt. And in the tales of the ineffectual
anti-hero, in the stories of Guy Montag and Winston Smith, lie the warnings of
contemporary storytellers playing on very primitive fears: that we are not strong enough
to defeat the monsters.

Only this time, not the monsters chased away by the campfire, but the very monsters who
built the campfire in the first place.
