title: The philosophy of cynicism
speaker: William D. Desmond
description: >-
 In the 4th century BCE, a young Diogenes of Sinope was found to be counterfeiting
 coins. He was stripped of his citizenship, his money, all his possessions and
 sent into exile. He decided he would live self-sufficiently, close to nature,
 without materialism, vanity, or conformity and only then could he be truly free.
 William D. Desmond details how Diogenes gave rise to the philosophy of cynicism.

In the 4th century BCE, a banker’s son threw the city of Sinope into scandal by
counterfeiting coins. When the dust finally settled, the young man, Diogenes of Sinope,
had been stripped of his citizenship, his money, and all his possessions. At least, that’s
how the story goes. While many of the details of Diogenes’ life are shadowy, the
philosophical ideas born out of his disgrace survive today. In exile, Diogenes decided 
that by rejecting the opinions of others and societal measures of success, he could be
truly free. He would live self-sufficiently, close to nature, without materialism,
vanity, or conformity. In practice, this meant he spent years wandering around Greek
cities with nothing but a cloak, staff, and knapsack— outdoors year-round, forgoing
technology, baths, and cooked food. He didn’t go about this new existence quietly, but is
said to have teased passers-by and mocked the powerful, eating, urinating and even
masturbating in public.

The citizens called him a kyôn— a barking dog. Though meant as an insult, dogs were
actually a good symbol for his philosophy— they’re happy creatures, free from
abstractions like wealth or reputation. Diogenes and his growing number of followers
became known as “dog philosophers,” or kynikoi, a designation that eventually became the
word “Cynic.” These early Cynics were a carefree bunch, drawn to the freedom of a
wandering lifestyle. As Diogenes’ reputation grew, others tried to challenge his
commitment. Alexander the Great offered him anything he desired. But instead of asking
for material goods, Diogenes only asked Alexander to get out of his sunshine. After
Diogenes’ death, adherents to his philosophy continued to call themselves Cynics for
about 900 years, until 500 CE. Some Greek philosophers, like the Stoics, thought everyone 
should follow Diogenes’ example. They also attempted to tone down his philosophy to be
more acceptable to conventional society— which, of course, was fundamentally at odds 
with his approach. Others viewed the Cynics less charitably.

In the Roman province of Syria in the 2nd century CE, the satirist Lucian described the
Cynics of his own time as unprincipled, materialistic, self-promoting hypocrites, who
only preached what Diogenes had once actually practiced. Reading Lucian’s texts centuries
later, Renaissance and Reformation writers called their rivals cynics as an insult—
meaning people who criticized others without having anything worthwhile to say. This usage
eventually laid the groundwork for the modern meaning of the word “cynic:" a person who
thinks everyone else is acting out of pure self-interest, even if they claim a higher
motive. Still, the philosophy of cynicism had admirers, especially among those who wished
to question the state of society. The 18th-century French philosopher Jean-Jacques
Rousseau was called the “new Diogenes” when he argued that the arts, sciences, and
technology, corrupt people. In 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche reimagined a story in which
Diogenes went into the Athenian marketplace with a lantern, searching in vain for a
single honest person.

In Nietszche’s version, a so-called madman rushes into a town square to proclaim that “God
is dead.” This was Nietzsche’s way of calling for a “revaluation of values,” and
rejecting the dominant Christian and Platonic idea of universal, spiritual insights 
beyond the physical world. Nietzsche admired Diogenes for sticking stubbornly to the
here-and-now. More recently, the hippies of the 1960s have been compared with Diogenes as
counter-cultural rebels. Diogenes’ ideas have been adopted and reimagined over and over
again. The original cynics might not have approved of these fresh takes: they believed 
that their values of rejecting custom and living closely with nature were the only true
values. Whether or not you agree with that, or with any of the later incarnations, all
have one thing in common: they questioned the status quo. And that’s an example we can
still follow: not to blindly follow conventional or majority views, but to think hard 
about what is truly valuable.
