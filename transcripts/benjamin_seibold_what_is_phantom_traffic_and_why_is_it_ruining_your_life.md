title: What is phantom traffic and why is it ruining your life?
speaker: Benjamin Seibold
description: >-
 You're cruising down the highway when all of a sudden endless rows of brake
 lights appear ahead. There's no accident, no stoplight, no change in speed limit,
 or narrowing of the road. So why is there so much traffic? It's due to a
 phenomenon called a phantom traffic jam. Benjamin Seibold explains why it happens
 and how we might prevent it in the future. [Directed by Cris Wiegandt, narrated

You’re cruising down the highway when all of a sudden endless rows of brake lights appear
ahead. There’s no accident, no stoplight, no change in speed limit or narrowing of the
road. So why the @#$%! is there so much traffic? When traffic comes to a near standstill 
for no apparent reason, it’s called a phantom traffic jam. A phantom traffic jam is an
emergent phenomenon whose behavior takes on a life of its own, greater than the sum of its
parts. But in spite of this, we can actually model these jams, even understand the
principles that shape them— and we’re closer than you might think to preventing this kind
of traffic in the future. For a phantom traffic jam to form, there must be a lot of cars
on the road. That doesn’t mean there are necessarily too many cars to pass through a
stretch of roadway smoothly, at least not if every driver maintains the same consistent
speed and spacing from other drivers.

In this dense, but flowing, traffic, it only takes a minor disturbance to set off the
chain of events that causes a traffic jam. Say one driver brakes slightly. Each successive
driver then brakes a little more strongly, creating a wave of brake lights that
propagates backward through the cars on the road. These stop-and-go waves can travel
along a highway for miles. With a low density of cars on the road, traffic flows smoothly 
because small disturbances, like individual cars changing lanes or slowing down at a
curve, are absorbed by other drivers’ adjustments. But once the number of cars on the
road exceeds a critical density, generally when cars are spaced less than 35 meters
apart, the system’s behavior changes dramatically. It begins to display dynamic
instability, meaning small disturbances are amplified. Dynamic instability isn’t unique 
to phantom traffic jams— it’s also responsible for raindrops, sand dunes, cloud patterns,
and more. The instability is a positive feedback loop.

Above the critical density, any additional vehicle reduces the number of cars per second
passing through a given point on the road. This in turn means it takes longer for a local
pileup to move out of a section of the road, increasing vehicle density even more, which
eventually adds up to stop-and-go traffic. Drivers tend not to realize they need to break
far in advance of a traffic jam, which means they end up having to brake harder to avoid
a collision. This strengthens the wave of braking from vehicle to vehicle. What’s more,
drivers tend to accelerate too rapidly out of a slowdown, meaning they try to drive faster
than the average flow of traffic downstream of them. Then, they have to brake again, 
eventually producing another feedback loop that causes more stop-and-go traffic. In both
cases, drivers make traffic worse simply because they don’t have a good sense of the
conditions ahead of them.

Self driving cars equipped with data on traffic conditions ahead from connected vehicles 
or roadway sensors might be able to counteract phantom traffic in real-time. These
vehicles would maintain a uniform speed, safety permitting, that matches the average
speed of the overall flow, preventing traffic waves from forming. In situations where
there’s already a traffic wave, the automated vehicle would be able to anticipate it,
braking sooner and more gradually than a human driver and reducing the strength of the
wave. And it wouldn’t take that many self-driving cars— In a recent experiment, one
autonomous vehicle for every 20 human drivers was enough to dampen and prevent traffic
waves. Traffic jams are not only a daily annoyance– they’re a major cause of fatalities,
wasted resources, and planet-threatening pollution. But new technology may help reduce 
these patterns, rendering our roads safer, our daily commutes more efficient, and our air
cleaner.

And the next time you’re stuck in traffic, it may help to remember that other drivers
aren’t necessarily driving spitefully, but are simply unaware of road conditions ahead—
and drive accordingly.
