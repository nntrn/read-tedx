title: NASA's first software engineer: Margaret Hamilton
speaker: Matt Porter and Margaret Hamilton
description: >-
 The Apollo 11 moon landing was about the astronauts, mission control, software
 and hardware all working together as a seamless integrated system. None of which
 would have been possible without the contributions of one engineer: Margaret
 Hamilton. Who was this pioneer? Matt Porter and Margaret Hamilton detail how a
 woman and her team launched the software that took mankind to the Moon. [Directed

At roughly 4pm on July 20, 1969, mankind was just minutes away from landing on the
surface of the moon. But before the astronauts began their final descent, an emergency
alarm lit up. Something was overloading the computer, and threatened to abort the
landing. Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton held her breath. She'd led the team developing 
the pioneering in-flight software, so she knew this mission had no room for error. But
the nature of this last-second emergency would soon prove her software was working
exactly as planned. Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana, Hamilton had always been
inquisitive. In college, she studied mathematics and philosophy, before taking a research
position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to pay for grad school. Here, she
encountered her first computer while developing software to support research into the new
field of chaos theory. Next at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton developed software for
America’s first air defense system to search for enemy aircraft.

But when she heard that renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking for help sending
mankind to the moon, she immediately joined his team. NASA looked to Draper and his group 
of over 400 engineers to invent the first compact digital flight computer, the Apollo
Guidance Computer. Using input from astronauts, this device would be responsible for
guiding, navigating and controlling the spacecraft. At a time when unreliable computers 
filled entire rooms, the AGC needed to operate without any errors, and fit in one cubic
foot of space. Draper divided the lab into two teams, one for designing hardware and one
for developing software. Hamilton led the team that built the on-board flight software
for both the Command and Lunar Modules. This work, for which she coined the term “software
engineering," was incredibly high stakes. Human lives were on the line, so every program
had to be perfect.

Margaret’s software needed to quickly detect unexpected errors and recover from them in
real time. But this kind of adaptable program was difficult to build, since early software
could only process jobs in a predetermined order. To solve this problem, Margaret
designed her program to be “asynchronous,” meaning the software's more important jobs
would interrupt less important ones. Her team assigned every task a unique priority to
ensure that each job occurred in the correct order and at the right time— regardless of
any surprises. After this breakthrough, Margaret realized her software could help the
astronauts work in an asynchronous environment as well. She designed Priority Displays
that would interrupt astronaut’s regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies.
The astronaut could then communicate with Mission Control to determine the best path
forward. This marked the first time flight software communicated directly— and
asynchronously— with a pilot. It was these fail safes that triggered the alarms just
before the lunar landing.

Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake— he’d inadvertently flipped the rendezvous radar
switch. This radar would be essential on their journey home, but here it was using up 
vital computational resources. Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer was well equipped
to manage this. During the overload, the software restart programs allowed only the
highest priority jobs to be processed— including the programs necessary for landing. The
Priority Displays gave the astronauts a choice— to land or not to land. With minutes to
spare, Mission Control gave the order. The Apollo 11 landing was about the astronauts,
Mission Control, software and hardware all working together as an integrated system of
systems. Hamilton’s contributions were essential to the work of engineers and scientists
inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s goal to reach the Moon. And her life-saving work 
went far beyond Apollo 11— no bugs were ever found in the in-flight software for any
crewed Apollo missions. After her work on Apollo, Hamilton founded a company that uses its
unique universal systems language to create breakthroughs for systems and
software.

In 2003, NASA honored her achievements with the largest financial award they’d ever given
to an individual. And 47 years after her software first guided astronauts to the moon,
Hamilton was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for changing the way we think 
about technology.
