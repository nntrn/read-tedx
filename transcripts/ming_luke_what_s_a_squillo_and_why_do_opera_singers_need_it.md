title: What's a squillo, and why do opera singers need it?
speaker: Ming Luke
description: >-
 An orchestra fills an opera house with music, but a singer's voice soars above
 the instruments. Its melody rings out across thousands of patrons— all without
 any assistance from a microphone. How is it possible that a single voice can be
 heard so clearly? The answer lies in the physics of the human voice. Ming Luke
 explains the carefully honed technique of an expert opera singer. [Directed by
 Franz Palomares, narrated by Addison Anderson].

Gripped with vengeful passion, The Queen of the Night tears across the stage. She begins
to sing her titular aria, one of the most famous sections from Mozart’s beloved opera,
"The Magic Flute." The orchestra fills the hall with music, but the queen’s voice soars
above the instruments. Its melody rings out across thousands of patrons, reaching seats
40 meters away— all without any assistance from a microphone. How is it possible that
this single voice can be heard so clearly, above the strains of dozens of instruments?
The answer lies in the physics of the human voice, and the carefully honed technique of
an expert opera singer. All the music in this opera house originates from the vibrations
created by instruments— whether it’s the strings of a violin or the vocal folds of a
performer. These vibrations send waves into the air, which our brains interpret as sound.
The frequency of these vibrations–– specifically, the number of waves per second–– is how
our brains determine the pitch of a single note.

But in fact, every note we hear is actually a combination of multiple vibrations. Imagine
a guitar string vibrating at its lowest frequency. This is called the fundamental, and
this low pitch is what our ears mostly use to identify a note. But this lowest vibration
triggers additional frequencies called overtones, which layer on top of the fundamental.
These overtones break down into specific frequencies called harmonics, or partials— and
manipulating them is how opera singers work their magic. Every note has a set of
frequencies that comprise its harmonic series. The first partial vibrates at twice the
frequency of the fundamental. The next partial is three times the fundamental’s
frequency, and so on. Virtually all acoustic instruments produce harmonic series, but
each instrument’s shape and material changes the balance of its harmonics. For example, a
flute emphasizes the first few partials, but in a clarinet’s lowest register, the
odd-numbered partials resonate most strongly.

The strength of various partials is part of what gives each instrument its unique sonic
signature. It also affects an instrument’s ability to stand out in a crowd, because our
ears are more strongly attuned to some frequencies than others. This is the key to an
opera singer’s power of projection. An operatic soprano— the highest of the four standard
 voice parts— can produce notes with fundamental frequencies ranging from 250 to 1,500
vibrations per second. Human ears are most sensitive to frequencies between 2,000 and
5,000 vibrations per second. So if the singer can bring out the partials in this range,
she can target a sensory sweet spot where she’s most likely to be heard. Higher partials
are also advantageous because there’s less competition from the orchestra, whose
overtones are weaker at those frequencies. The result of emphasizing these partials is a
distinctive ringing timbre called a singer’s squillo. Opera singers work for decades to
create their squillo.

They can produce higher frequencies by modifying the shape and tension in their vocal
folds and vocal tract. And by shifting the position of their tongues and lips, they
accentuate some overtones while dampening others. Singers also increase their range of
partials with vibrato— a musical effect in which a note slightly oscillates in pitch.
This creates a fuller sound that rings out over the instruments’ comparatively narrow
vibratos. Once they have the right partials, they employ other techniques to boost their
volume. Singers expand their lung capacity and perfect their posture for consistent,
controlled airflow. The concert hall helps as well, with rigid surfaces that reflect 
sound waves towards the audience. All singers take advantage of these techniques, but
different vocal signatures demand different physical preparation. A Wagnerian singer
needs to build up stamina to power through the composer’s four-hour epics.

While bel canto singers require versatile vocal folds to vault through acrobatic arias.
Biology also sets some limits— not every technique is feasible for every set of muscles,
and voices change as singers age. But whether in an opera hall or a shower stall, these
techniques can turn un-amplified voices into thundering musical masterpieces.
