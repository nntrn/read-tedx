A new virus emerges and spreads like wildfire. In order to contain it, researchers must
first collect data about who’s been infected. Two main viral testing techniques are
critical: one tells you if you have the virus and the other shows if you’ve already had
it. So, how exactly do these tests work? PCR, or polymerase chain reaction testing,
targets the virus’s genetic material in the body and is used to diagnose someone who is
currently infected. Yet, this genetic material may be present in such imperceptible
amounts that actually detecting it is difficult. This is where PCR comes in: it’s widely
used to amplify genetic information to large enough quantities that it can be readily
observed. To develop a PCR test for a never-before-seen virus, researchers first sequence
 its genetic material, or genome, and identify regions that are unique to that specific
virus. PCR then targets these particular segments. A PCR test begins by collecting a
sample: this can be blood for hepatitis viruses, feces for poliovirus, and samples from
the nose or throat for coronaviruses.

The sample is taken to a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test for the
presence of the virus’ genome. Genetic information can be encoded via DNA or RNA. HPV,
for example, uses DNA, while SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, uses RNA. Before running
the PCR, the viral RNA— if present— must be reverse transcribed to make a strand of
complementary DNA. Researchers then run the PCR. If the virus is present in the sample, 
its unique regions of genetic code will be identified by complementary primers and copied
by enzymes. One strand of DNA becomes hundreds of millions, which are detected using
probes marked with fluorescent dye. If the PCR machine senses fluorescence, the sample has
tested positive for the virus, meaning the individual is infected. Immunoassays, on the
other hand, tap into the immune system’s memory of the virus, showing if someone has
previously been infected.

They work by targeting virus-specific antibodies generated by the immune system during
infection. These are specialized classes of proteins that identify and fight foreign 
substances, like viruses. Immunoassays may detect IgG antibodies, the most abundant
class, and IgM antibodies, the type that’s first produced in response to a new infection.
The presence of IgM antibodies suggests a recent infection, but since it can take the
body over a week to produce a detectable amount, they’re unreliable in diagnosing 
current infections. Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate for an extended period after
infection; their presence usually indicates that someone was exposed and recovered. Before
the immunoassay, health professionals draw blood from an individual. This sample then
comes into contact with a portion of the virus of interest. If the body has, in fact,
been exposed to the virus in the past, the body’s virus-specific antibodies will bind to
it during the test.

This reaction produces a change in color, indicating that the sample tested positive and
that the individual has been exposed to the virus. Immunoassays are especially important
when it comes to retroactively diagnosing people who were infected but went untested. And
there’s exciting potential for those who have developed immunity to a virus: in some
cases, their blood plasma could be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting
it. PCR and immunoassays are always in the process of becoming more accurate and
efficient. For example, innovations in PCR have led to the use of self-contained testing
devices that relay results within one hour. Digital PCR, which quantifies individual 
pieces of target DNA, shows promise in further boosting accuracy. And although
immunoassays are difficult to develop quickly, researchers in Singapore were able to
create one for SARS-CoV-2 even before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.

These tests— along with the scientists who develop them and the health professionals who
administer them— are absolutely essential. And when deployed early, they can save
millions of lives.
