title: Mating frenzies, sperm hoards, and brood raids: the life of a fire ant queen
speaker: Walter R. Tschinkel
description: >-
 In the spring, just after a heavy rainfall, male and female fire ants swarm the
 skies for a day of romance, known as the nuptial flight. Thousands of reproduction-capable
 ants take part in a mating frenzy, and for one successfully mated female, her
 work is only beginning. Walter R. Tschinkel details how the new queen builds a
 colony and protects it from neighboring ant armies. [Directed by Lisa Vertudaches,
 narrated by Addison Anderson, music by Phil Brookes].

It’s June, just after a heavy rainfall, and the sky is filling with creatures we wouldn’t
normally expect to find there. At first glance, this might be a disturbing sight. But for
the lucky males and females of Solenopsis invicta, otherwise known as fire ants, it’s a
day of romance. This is the nuptial flight, when thousands of reproduction-capable male
and female ants, called alates, take wing for the first and last time. But even for
successful males who manage to avoid winged predators, this mating frenzy will prove
lethal. And for a successfully mated female, her work is only beginning. Having secured a
lifetime supply of sperm from her departed mate, our new queen must now single-handedly 
start an entire colony. Descending to the ground, she searches for a suitable spot to
build her nest. Ideally, she can find somewhere with loose, easy-to-dig soil— like
farmland already disturbed by human activity.

Once she finds the perfect spot, she breaks off her wings— creating the stubs that
establish her royal status. Then, she starts digging a descending tunnel ending in a
chamber. Here the queen begins laying her eggs, about ten per day, and the first larvae
hatch within a week. Over the next three weeks, the new queen relies on a separate batch 
of unfertilized eggs to nourish both herself and her brood, losing half her body weight 
in the process. Thankfully, after about 20 days, these larvae grow into the first
generation of workers, ready to forage for food and sustain their shrunken queen. Her
daughters will have to work quickly though— returning their mother to good health is
urgent. In the surrounding area, dozens of neighboring queens are building their own ant
armies. These colonies have peacefully coexisted so far, but once workers appear, a
phenomenon known as brood-raiding begins. Workers from nests up to several meters away
begin to steal offspring from our queen.

Our colony retaliates, but new waves of raiders from even further away overwhelm the
workers. Within hours, the raiders have taken our queen’s entire brood supply to the
largest nearby nest— and the queen’s surviving daughters abandon her. Chasing her last
chance of survival, the queen follows the raiding trail to the winning nest. She fends
off other losing queens and the defending nest’s workers, fighting her way to the top of
the brood pile. Her daughters help their mother succeed where other queens fail—
defeating the reigning monarch, and usurping the brood pile. Eventually, all the
remaining challengers fail, until only one queen— and one brood pile— remains. Now
presiding over several hundred workers in the neighborhood’s largest nest, our victorious
queen begins aiding her colony in its primary goal: reproduction. For the next several
years, the colony only produces sterile workers. But once their population exceeds about
23,000, it changes course.

From now on, every spring, the colony will produce fertile alate males and females. The
colony spawns these larger ants throughout the early summer, and returns to worker
production in the fall. After heavy rainfalls, these alates take to the skies, and
spread their queen’s genes up to a couple hundred meters downwind. But to contribute to
this annual mating frenzy, the colony must continue to thrive as one massive
super-organism. Every day, younger ants feed the queen and tend to the brood, while older
workers forage for food and defend the nest. When intruders strike, these older warriors
fend them off using poisonous venom. After rainfalls, the colony comes together, using
the wet dirt to expand their nest. And when a disastrous flood drowns their home, the
sisters band together into a massive living raft— carrying their queen to safety. But no
matter how resilient, the life of a colony must come to an end.

After about 8 years, our queen runs out of sperm and can no longer replace dying workers.
The nest’s population dwindles, and eventually, they’re taken over by a neighboring
colony. Our queen’s reign is over, but her genetic legacy lives on.
