 After speaking at TED2007 on elegance in physics, the amazing Murray Gell-Mann
 gives a quick overview of another passionate interest: finding the common
 ancestry of our modern languages.

Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics. In fact, mostly now in other
things. One thing is distant relationships among human languages. And the professional,
historical linguists in the U.S. and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any
long-distance relationships, big groupings, groupings that go back a long time, longer
than the familiar families. They don't like that. They think it's crank. I don't think
it's crank. And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians, who are working on
that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow, and I would love to see where that leads. Does
it really lead to a single ancestor some 20, 25,000 years ago? And what if we go back
beyond that single ancestor, when there was presumably a competition among many languages?
How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go? How many tens of
thousands of years does it go back? Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what
the answer to that is? Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be
older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in
the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe, in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years
ago, or earlier.

I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language. So, I
would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further. But that
doesn't mean that all, or many, or most of today's attested languages couldn't descend
perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years, or something of
that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck. CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right.
You may just know more about everything than anyone. So, it's been an honor. Thank you
Murray Gell-Mann.
