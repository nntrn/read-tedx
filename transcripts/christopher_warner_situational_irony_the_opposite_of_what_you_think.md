title: Situational irony: The opposite of what you think
speaker: Christopher Warner
description: >-
 Leaps and bounds separate that which is ironic and that which many people simply
 say is ironic. Christopher Warner wants to set the record straight: Something is
 ironic if and only if it is the exact opposite of what you would expect.

Picture this: your friend and you are watching a sitcom and a sassy sidekick walks into a
room, carrying a four-tiered wedding cake. He trips, falls,and face-plants into the cake.
Your friend doubles over with laughter and says, "It's so ridiculous! So ironic!" Well,
quick, what do you do? Do you laugh along with the laugh track and let this grievous
misinterpretation of irony go? Or, do you throw caution to the wind and explain the true
meaning of irony? If you're me, you choose the latter. Unfortunately, irony has been
completely misunderstood. We tend to throw out that term whenever we see something funny
or coincidental. And while many examples of true irony can be funny, that is not the
driving factor of being ironic. A situation is only ironic if what happens is the exact
opposite of what was expected. If you expect A, but get B, then you have irony. Let's take
the slap-stick cake situation as an example.

When someone walks in precariously balancing something that shouldn't be carried alone,
trips, falls, and makes a mess, it is funny, but it's not ironic. In fact, you probably
expect someone who is single-handedly carrying a huge cake to trip. When he does, reality
aligns with expectations, and so that is not irony. But what if the sassy sidekick walked
in wearing a gold medal that he'd won at the cake walking event at the Atlanta Olympics in
1996? What if that sidekick was a professional cake carrier? Then, maybe there would have
been a reasonable expectation that he would have been more skilled when carrying a
ridiculously large cake. Then, when that reasonable expectation was not met by the
tripping sidekick, irony would have been exemplified. Another example. A senior citizen
texting and blogging. The common and reasonable expectation of more mature men and women
is that they don't like or know technology, that they have a hard time turning on a
computer, or that they have the old brick cell phones from the 1980s.

One should not expect them to be connected, high-tech, or savvy enough to text or to be
blogging, which must seem like some sort of newfangled thing that "back in my day," they
never had. So when Granny pulls out her smart phone to post pictures of her dentures or
her grandkids, irony ensues. Reasonable expectations of the situation are not met. That is
irony. So while the cake dropper might not be ironic, there are all kinds of situations in
life that are. Go out, and find those true examples of irony.
