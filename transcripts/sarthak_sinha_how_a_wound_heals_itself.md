title: How a wound heals itself
speaker: Sarthak Sinha
description: >-
 Our skin is the largest organ in our bodies, with a surface area of about 20
 square feet in adults. When we are cut or wounded, our skin begins to repair
 itself through a complex, well-coordinated process. Sarthak Sinha takes us past
 the epidermis and into the dermis to investigate this regenerative response.

The largest organ in your body isn't your liver or your brain. It's your skin, with a
surface area of about 20 square feet in adults. Though different areas of the skin have
different characteristics, much of this surface performs similar functions, such as
sweating, feeling heat and cold, and growing hair. But after a deep cut or wound, the
newly healed skin will look different from the surrounding area, and may not fully regain
all its abilities for a while, or at all. To understand why this happens, we need to look
at the structure of the human skin. The top layer, called the epidermis, consists mostly
of hardened cells, called keratinocytes, and provides protection. Since its outer layer is
constantly being shed and renewed, it's pretty easy to repair. But sometimes a wound
penetrates into the dermis, which contains blood vessels and the various glands and nerve
endings that enable the skin's many functions.

And when that happens, it triggers the four overlapping stages of the regenerative
process. The first stage, hemostasis, is the skin's response to two immediate threats:
that you're now losing blood and that the physical barrier of the epidermis has been
compromised. As the blood vessels tighten to minimize the bleeding, in a process known as 
vasoconstriction, both threats are averted by forming a blood clot. A special protein
known as fibrin forms cross-links on the top of the skin, preventing blood from flowing
out and bacteria or pathogens from getting in. After about three hours of this, the skin
begins to turn red, signaling the next stage, inflammation. With bleeding under control
and the barrier secured, the body sends special cells to fight any pathogens that may have
gotten through. Among the most important of these are white blood cells, known as
macrophages, which devour bacteria and damage tissue through a process known as
phagocytosis, in addition to producing growth factors to spur healing.

And because these tiny soldiers need to travel through the blood to get to the wound
site, the previously constricted blood vessels now expand in a process called
vasodilation. About two to three days after the wound, the proliferative stage occurs,
when fibroblast cells begin to enter the wound. In the process of collagen deposition,
they produce a fibrous protein called collagen in the wound site, forming connective skin
tissue to replace the fibrin from before. As epidermal cells divide to reform the outer
layer of skin, the dermis contracts to close the wound. Finally, in the fourth stage of
remodeling, the wound matures as the newly deposited collagen is rearranged and converted
into specific types. Through this process, which can take over a year, the tensile
strength of the new skin is improved, and blood vessels and other connections are
strengthened. With time, the new tissue can reach from 50-80% of some of its original
healthy function, depending on the severity of the initial wound and on the function
itself.

But because the skin does not fully recover, scarring continues to be a major clinical
issue for doctors around the world. And even though researchers have made significant
strides in understanding the healing process, many fundamental mysteries remain
unresolved. For instance, do fibroblast cells arrive from the blood vessels or from skin
tissue adjacent to the wound? And why do some other mammals, such as deer, heal their
wounds much more efficiently and completely than humans? By finding the answers to these
questions and others, we may one day be able to heal ourselves so well that scars will be
just a memory.
