title: Bluegrass virtuosity from ... New Jersey?
speaker: Sleepy Man Banjo Boys
description: >-
 All under the age of 16, brothers Jonny, Robbie and Tommy Mizzone are from New
 Jersey, a US state that's better known for the rock of Bruce Springsteen than the
 bluegrass of Earl Scruggs. Nonetheless, the siblings began performing bluegrass
 covers, as well as their own compositions, at a young age. Here, they play three
 dazzling songs in three different keys, passing the lead back and forth from
 fiddle to banjo to guitar.

Robbie Mizzone: Thank you. Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much. We're so excited to be here.
It's such an honor. Like he said, we're three brothers from New Jersey â€” you know, the
bluegrass capital of the world.

We discovered bluegrass a few years ago, and we fell in love with it. We hope you guys
will too. This next song is an original we wrote called "Time Lapse," and it will probably
live up to its name.

TM: Thank you very much. RM: I'm just going to take a second to introduce the band. On
guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy.

On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny.

He's also our brother. And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14, and I play the fiddle.

As you can see, we decided to make it hard on ourselves, and we chose to play three songs
in three different keys.

Yeah. I'm also going to explain, a lot of people want to know where we got the name
"Sleepy Man Banjo Boys" from. So, it started when Jonny was little, and he first started
the banjo, he would play on his back with his eyes closed, and we'd say it looked like he
was sleeping. So you can probably piece the rest together. TM: We can't really figure out
the reason. It might have been that it weighs about a million pounds.

TM: Thank you very much.

RM: Thank you.
