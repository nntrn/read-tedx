“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change
direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and
over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just before dawn. Why? Because
this storm isn't something that blew in from far away… This storm is you. Something
inside of you.”This quote, from the first chapter of Haruki Murakami’s "Kafka on the
Shore," captures the teenage protagonist's turmoil. Desperate to escape his tyrannical
father and the family curse he feels doomed to repeat, he renames himself Kafka after
his favorite author and runs away from home. But memories of a missing mother, along with
dreams that haunt his waking life, prove more difficult to outrun. Published in Japanese
in 2002 and translated into English three years later, "Kafka on the Shore" is an epic
literary puzzle filled with time travel, hidden histories, and magical
underworlds.

Readers delight in discovering how the mind-bending imagery, whimsical characters and
eerie coincidences fit together. Kafka narrates every second chapter, with the rest
centering on an old man named Satoru Nakata. After awakening from a coma he went into
during the Second World War, Nakata loses the ability to read and write– but gains a
mysterious knack for talking to cats. When he’s asked to tail a missing pet, he’s thrown
onto a dangerous path that runs parallel to Kafka’s. Soon prophecies come true, portals
to different dimensions open up– and fish and leeches begin raining from the sky. But
what ties these two characters together– and is it a force either one of them can
control? The collision of different worlds is a common thread in Haruki Murakami’s work.
His novels and short stories often forge fantastic connections between personal
experience, supernatural possibilities, and Japanese history. Born in Kyoto in 1949,
Murakami grew up during the post-World War II American occupation of Japan.

The shadow of war hung over his life as it does his fiction; "Kafka on the Shore" 
features biological attacks, military ghosts and shady conspiracies. Murakami’s work blurs
historical periods and draws from multiple cultural traditions. References to Western
society and Japanese customs tumble over each other, from literature and fashion to food
and ghost stories. He has a penchant for musical references, too, especially in "Kafka on
the Shore." As the runaway Kafka wanders the streets of a strange city, Led Zeppelin and
Prince keep him company. Soon, he takes refuge in an exquisite private library. While he
spends his days poring over old books and contemplating a strange painting and the
library’s mysterious owner, he also befriends the librarian– who introduces him to
classical music like Schubert. This musical sensibility makes Murakami’s work all the more
hypnotic. He frequently bends the line between reality and a world of dreams, and is
considered a master of magic lurking in the mundane.

This is a key feature of magical realism. In contrast to fantasy, magic in this sort of
writing rarely offers a way out of a problem. Instead, it becomes just one more thing
that complicates life. In "Kafka on the Shore," characters are faced with endless
otherworldly distractions, from a love sick ghost to a flute made from cat souls. These
challenges offer no easy answers. Instead, they leave us marveling at the resourcefulness
of the human spirit to deal with the unexpected. While Kafka often seems suspended in
strangeness, there’s a tenderness and integrity at the heart of his mission that keeps
him moving forward. Gradually he comes to accept his inner confusion. In the end, his
experience echoes the reader’s: the deeper you go, the more you find.
