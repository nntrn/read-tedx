title: How peer educators can transform sex education
speaker: Thea Holcomb
description: >-
 Where are teens supposed to learn about sex, asks student speaker Thea Holcomb.
 From alarmist imagery about sexually transmitted diseases? From the Internet and
 all its attendant judgment, bias and dysfunction? The answer, she suggests, lies
 with peer educators. In this talk, Holcomb explains why properly trained peer
 educators are the right people to disseminate both accurate information and
 healthy attitudes. As she says, "When you get accurate, judgment-free information
 from your peers, you realize that sex ed doesn't have to be scary."

Greetings audience, I'm Thea, I'm a high school student, and today we're going to talk
about sex. [It won't be too scary.] Operating on the assumption you're human, you've
certainly heard of sex. In case you haven't, to get you up to speed, sex is the process
by which many organisms ensure their continued existence. Here's the thing though: sex is
more complicated than that because - spoiler alert! - humans are complicated. So how do we
learn about sex if it's so complicated? You might remember sex education like this: [Don't
have sex; you will get PREGNANT and die.] Urban Dictionary - your source for news and
information about the 21st century zeitgeist - describes sex education as: ".. where they
try to scare you out of having sex with pictures of diseased genitals..." A more hopeful
description of sex education would be something like: a lifelong process of learning about
sex and sexuality, exploring values and beliefs and gaining skills to navigate
relationships and manage your sexual health.

This, as far as I'm concerned, is a solid definition. So what can we do to make sex
education something that teens find actually, like, educational. Clearly, teens need
answers to their questions. Where do people go when they have questions? [The Internet]
Listen, I love the Internet. It's one of the greatest developments in human information
exchange. [Yes. Thanks Internet.] But what it says about sexual health is not accurate by
any stretch of the imagination or is so laden with bias that it feels more like being
pelted with judgement than actually receiving information. Unfortunately, not every teen
is willing and able to chat it up with their parents about sex. So if not always the
Internet, where can teens turn? Enter the peer educator. People my age do, indeed, talk to
each other about sex. So when teens are sources of accurate information, it spreads among
us quickly. As a peer educator, I belong to a program that gives me the tools to learn
about everything from STIs and safe sex to contraception and consent.

Basically, I can tell you more about human sexuality than the average adult. When teens
see someone like me instead of someone older, they're quite open to the information I have
to offer them. At lunch once, some friends wanted to know the difference between hormonal
and copper IUDs. So I brought this to the table. Another day, my teacher didn't understand
how emergency contraception works. So I explained it to the class. What does it look like
when teens ask me questions about sexual health? It goes something like this. Venereal
disease, STD, STI? This terminology, it baffles me. STI stands for sexually transmitted
infection. We used to say STD, which stood for sexually transmitted disease, but it was
changed recently because STI is a more medically accurate term, and taking away the big
scary word "disease" helps decrease stigma. What the heck is trichomoniasis? Well,
trichomoniasis is a STI usually spread through vaginal intercourse. It's curable with just
one dose of an oral drug.

Common symptoms, regardless of a person's sex, are unusual discharge, painful urination
and itching. But it spreads really quickly because most of the time it's asymptomatic,
which means people don't realize they have it. That's why it's so important to get tested
regularly. Is it OK to be gay? Yes, all people of all identities and backgrounds,
including on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, can live healthy and productive lives. Regardless of
your beliefs, everyone has the right to explore and express their sexuality without the
fear of shame or judgement. Thanks! So often, when my peers approach me with questions
like these, seeking this or that piece of information, at least a sliver of what they're
wondering is: "Am I normal?" So let's talk about normal. Part of the point of peer
education is to give teens the opportunity to understand that there is no such thing as
the elusive "normal." Peer educators are here to say they're armed with information that
empowers you to make informed decisions; you are going to be OK.

"Normal" isn't really necessary. When you can get accurate, judgement-free information
from your peers, you realize that sex-ed doesn't have to be scary. So instead of striving
to be normal, let's talk to each other. Since peer education allows sex-ed to reach the
community in ways that go far beyond pictures of diseased genitals, it turns out to be
pretty brilliant. An idea that, unlike trichomoniasis, is certainly worth
spreading.
