title: How to save a language from extinction
speaker: Daniel Bögre Udell
description: >-
 As many as 3,000 languages could disappear within the next 80 years, all but
 silencing entire cultures. In this quick talk, language activist Daniel Bögre
 Udell shows how people around the world are finding new ways to revive ancestral
 languages and rebuild their traditions -- and encourages us all to investigate
 the tongues of our ancestors. "Reclaiming your language and embracing your
 culture is a powerful way to be yourself," he says.

Languages don't just die naturally. People abandon mother tongues, because they're forced
to. Often, the pressure is political. In 1892, the US Army general Richard Henry Pratt
argued that killing indigenous cultures was the only alternative to killing indigenous
people. "Kill the Indian," he said, "but save the man." And until 1978, the government did
just that, removing indigenous children from their families and forcing them into boarding
schools where they were given English names and punished for speaking their languages.
Assimilation was a compliment to genocide. Seven thousand languages are alive today, but
few are recognized by their own governments or supported online. So for people from the
vast majority of cultures, globalization remains profoundly alienating. It means giving up
your language for someone else's. And if nothing changes, as many as 3,000 languages could
disappear in 80 years. But things are changing.

Around the world, people are reviving ancestral languages and rebuilding their cultures.
As far as we know, language reclamation began in the 1800s when, at a time of rising
antisemitism, Jewish communities looked to their ancestral language, Hebrew, as a means of
cultural revival. And though it had been dormant for over 1,000 years, it was well
preserved in books of Jewish religion and philosophy. So Jewish activists studied and
taught it to their children, raising the first native speakers in nearly 100 generations.
Today, it's the mother tongue of five million Jews. And at least for me, an assimilated
English-speaking member of the Jewish diaspora, a pillar of cultural sovereignty. Two
thousand years later, we're still here. Now, until recently, Hebrew's reawakening was an
anomaly. Few languages are as well preserved as ours was, and the creation of Israel, the
first Jewish state in over 1,000 years, provided a space for Hebrew's daily
use.

In other words, most cultures just weren't given a chance.

Good evening, I'm Elizabeth and I live in Cornwall. That was Cornish, the ancestral
language of Cornwall, which today is technically a county in southern England. In the
1900s, Cornish activists fought for their culture. The language had been dormant for over
100 years, but they used old books and plays to teach it to their children. However, this
new generation of Cornish speakers was scattered across Cornwall and unable to use the
language freely. By the 1990s, Cornish had reawakened, but it wasn't thriving. Then, in
the early 2000s, Cornish speakers found one another online and leveraged digital spaces to
speak on a daily basis. From there, they organized weekly or monthly events where they
could gather and speak in public. Today, some schools teach Cornish. There are Cornish
language signs, ice-cream commercials, Wikipedia, and even memes.

And with their language once again intact, the people of Cornwall have secured recognition
as a Celtic nation alongside Ireland, Scotland and Wales. They stared down centuries of
forced assimilation and said, "We're not a county in England. We're a people in our own
right. And we're still here."And they're not the only ones. The Tunica-Biloxi tribe of
Louisiana is reviving their ancestral language.

My name is Teyanna. My friends, they call me "Quiet Storm."It started in the 1980s, when
Donna Pierite and her family started taking trips to Baton Rouge and New Orleans to
photocopy old dictionaries stored away in university archives. The goal was to study
Tunica and teach it to the children and share it with the community. Today, they're
leading a Tunica renaissance. Since 2014, there are nearly 100 speakers in language
immersion classes, and according to a 2017 census, 32 new fluent speakers, some of whom,
like Donna's daughter Elisabeth, are teaching Tunica to their children. These new speakers
are creating content, Facebook videos and also memes.

And the more they publish, the more they inspire other Tunica people to get involved.
Recently, a tribal member living in Texas wrote Elisabeth on Facebook, asking how to say
"bless these lands." It was for a yard sign, so she could show her neighbors that her
culture is alive and thriving today. Now, Hebrew, Cornish and Tunica are just three
examples from a groundswell of language activism on every continent. And whether they're
Jèrriais speakers from the Channel Isles, or Kenyan sign language speakers from Nairobi,
all communities working to preserve or reclaim a language have one thing in common: media,
so their language can be shared and taught. And as the internet grows, expanding media
access and creation, preserving and reclaiming ancestral languages is now more possible
than ever. So what are your ancestral languages? Mine are Hebrew, Yiddish, Hungarian and
Scottish Gaelic, even though I was raised in English. And luckily for me, each of these
languages is available online.

Hebrew in particular — it came installed on my iPhone, it's supported by Google Translate,
it even has autocorrect. And while your language may not be as widely supported, I
encourage you to investigate, because chances are, someone, somewhere, has started getting
it online. Reclaiming your language and embracing your culture is a powerful way to be
yourself in the age of globalization, because as I recently learned to say in Hebrew,
"'nḥnw 'dyyn k'n" — we're still here. Thank you.
