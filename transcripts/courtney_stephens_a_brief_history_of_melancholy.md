 If you are a living, breathing human being, chances are you have felt sad at
 least a few times in your life. But what exactly is melancholy, and what (if
 anything) should we do about it? Courtney Stephens details our still-evolving

Sadness is part of the human experience, but for centuries there has been vast
disagreement over what exactly it is and what, if anything, to do about it. In its
simplest terms, sadness is often thought of as the natural reaction to a difficult
situation. You feel sad when a friend moves away or when a pet dies. When a friend says,
"I'm sad," you often respond by asking, "What happened?" But your assumption that sadness
has an external cause outside the self is a relatively new idea. Ancient Greek doctors
didn't view sadness that way. They believed it was a dark fluid inside the body. According
to their humoral system, the human body and soul were controlled by four fluids, known as
humors, and their balance directly influenced a person's health and temperament.
Melancholia comes from melaina kole, the word for black bile, the humor believed to cause
sadness. By changing your diet and through medical practices, you could bring your humors
into balance.

Even though we now know much more about the systems that govern the human body, these
Greek ideas about sadness resonate with current views, not on the sadness we all
occasionally feel, but on clinical depression. Doctors believe that certain kinds of
long-term, unexplained emotional states are at least partially related to brain chemistry,
the balance of various chemicals present inside the brain. Like the Greek system,
changing the balance of these chemicals can deeply alter how we respond to even extremely
difficult circumstances. There's also a long tradition of attempting to discern the value
of sadness, and in that discussion, you'll find a strong argument that sadness is not only
an inevitable part of life but an essential one. If you've never felt melancholy, you've
missed out on part of what it means to be human. Many thinkers contend that melancholy is
necessary in gaining wisdom. Robert Burton, born in 1577, spent his life studying the
causes and experience of sadness.

In his masterpiece "The Anatomy of Melancholy," Burton wrote, "He that increaseth wisdom
increaseth sorrow." The Romantic poets of the early 19th century believed melancholy
allows us to more deeply understand other profound emotions, like beauty and joy. To
understand the sadness of the trees losing their leaves in the fall is to more fully
understand the cycle of life that brings flowers in the spring. But wisdom and emotional
intelligence seem pretty high on the hierarchy of needs. Does sadness have value on a more
basic, tangible, maybe even evolutionary level? Scientists think that crying and feeling
withdrawn is what originally helped our ancestors secure social bonds and helped them get
the support they needed. Sadness, as opposed to anger or violence, was an expression of
suffering that could immediately bring people closer to the suffering person, and this
helped both the person and the larger community to thrive.

Perhaps sadness helped generate the unity we needed to survive, but many have wondered
whether the suffering felt by others is anything like the suffering we experience
ourselves. The poet Emily Dickinson wrote, "I measure every Grief I meet With narrow,
probing Eyes - I wonder if it weighs like MIne - Or has an Easier size." And in the 20th
century, medical anthropologists, like Arthur Kleinman, gathered evidence from the way
people talk about pain to suggest that emotions aren't universal at all, and that culture,
particularly the way we use language, can influence how we feel. When we talk about
heartbreak, the feeling of brokenness becomes part of our experience, where as in a
culture that talks about a bruised heart, there actually seems to be a different
subjective experience. Some contemporary thinkers aren't interested in sadness'
subjectivity versus universality, and would rather use technology to eliminate suffering
in all its forms.

David Pearce has suggested that genetic engineering and other contemporary processes
cannot only alter the way humans experience emotional and physical pain, but that world
ecosystems ought to be redesigned so that animals don't suffer in the wild. He calls his
project "paradise engineering." But is there something sad about a world without sadness?
Our cavemen ancestors and favorite poets might not want any part of such a paradise. In
fact, the only things about sadness that seem universally agreed upon are that it has been
felt by most people throughout time, and that for thousands of years, one of the best ways
we have to deal with this difficult emotion is to articulate it, to try to express what
feels inexpressable. In the words of Emily Dickinson, "'Hope' is the thing with feathers -
That perches in the soul - "And sings the tune without the words - And never stops - at
all -"
