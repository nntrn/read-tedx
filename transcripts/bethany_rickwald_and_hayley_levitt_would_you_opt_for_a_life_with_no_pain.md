Imagine if you could plug your brain into a machine that would bring you ultimate
pleasure for the rest of your life. If you were given the choice to sign up for that kind
of existence, would you? That's the question philosopher Robert Nozick posed through a
thought experiment he called the Experience Machine. The experiment asks us to consider a
world in which scientists have developed a machine that would simulate real life while
guaranteeing experiences of only pleasure and never pain. The catch? You have to
permanently leave reality behind, but you'll hardly know the difference. Your experiences
will be indistinguishable from reality. Life's natural ups and downs will just be
replaced with an endless series of ups. Sounds great, right? It may seem like a tempting
offer, but perhaps it's not as ideal as it sounds. The experiment was actually designed to
refute a philosophical notion called hedonism.

According to hedonists, maximizing net pleasure is the most important thing in life
because pleasure is the greatest good that life has to offer. For hedonists, the best
choice that a person could make for himself is one that brings him the greatest possible
amount of pleasure while bringing him no pain. Limitless pleasure minus zero pain equals
maximum net pleasure, or in other words, the exact scenario the Experience Machine offers.
Therefore, if hedonism is your philosophy of choice, plugging in would be a no-brainer.
But what if there's more to life than just pleasure? That's what Nozick believed he was
demonstrating through his Experience Machine thought experiment. Despite the machine's
promise of maximum net pleasure, he still found reason not to plug in, as do many other
experimenters who consider the proposition. But what could possibly dissuade us from
choosing a future of ultimate pleasure? Consider this scenario. Betsy and Xander are in a
loving, committed relationship.

Betsy is head over heels and has never felt happier. However, unbeknownst to Betsy, Xander
has been romancing her sister, Angelica, with love letters and secret rendezvous for the
duration of their relationship. If Betsy found out, it would destroy her relationships 
with both Xander and Angelica, and the experience would be so traumatic, she would never
love again. Since Betsy is in blissful ignorance about Xander's infidelity, hedonists
would say she's better off remaining in the dark and maintaining her high level of net
pleasure. As long as Betsy never finds out about the relationship, her life is guaranteed
to go on as happily as it is right now. So, is there value in Besty knowing the truth of
her situation? Imagine if you were Betsy. Would you prefer to know the truth? If the
answer is yes, you'd be choosing an option that sharply decreases your net pleasure.
Perhaps, then, you believe that there are things in life with greater intrinsic value than
pleasure.

Truth, knowledge, authentic connection with other human beings. These are all things that
might make the list. By never learning the truth, Betsy is essentially living life in her
own personal Experience Machine, a world of happiness that's not based in reality. This
love triangle is an extreme example, but it mirrors many of the decisions we make in day
to day life. So whether you're making a choice for Betsy or for yourself, why might you
feel reality should be a factor? Is there inherent value in real experiences, whether
pleasurable or painful? Do you yourself have more value when you're experiencing real
life's pleasures and pains? Nozick's experiment may not provide all the answers, but it
forces us to consider whether real life, though imperfect, holds some intrinsic value 
beyond the pleasure of plugging in.
