In 1982, a young nurse was suffering from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t
work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough to read the newspaper. One treatment
changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, her symptoms
lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate school, where she earned high grades.
At first, she talked openly about her life changing treatment. But as she realized many
people had an extremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT
carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little resemblance to the modern
procedure. The therapy was first used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors
administered a strong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure during
which patients might bite their tongues or even break bones. Modern ECT is very
different. While a patient is under general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series of
mild electrical pulses to the brain.

This causes huge numbers of neurons to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A
muscle relaxant keeps spasms from spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical
indication of the electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts
for about a minute, and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an hour
after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases of major depression or
bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded to other therapies, or who have had
adverse reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo treatment experience
an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or three sessions
per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement in their symptoms after
just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less
frequent treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance
sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than it used to be, but
patients can still experience side effects.

They may feel achy, fatigued, or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble
remembering what happened right before a session— for example, what they had for dinner
the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble remembering up to weeks and months
before. For most patients, this memory loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is
that despite its proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons
in the brain communicate via electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, 
contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked by ECT alters
that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release of certain neurotransmitters, 
molecules that help carry signals between neurons and influence mental health. ECT also
stimulates the flow of hormones that may help reduce symptoms of depression. 
Interestingly, ECT maintenance works better when paired with medication, even in patients
who were resistant to medication before.

As we come to a better understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make ECT even
more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after her first course of ECT, the nurse
decided to publish an account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding the
treatment, she worried that doing so might negatively impact her personal and professional
life, but she knew ECT could make a difference for patients when all else failed. Though
misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make doctors and patients
alike aware of the treatment’s life changing potential.
