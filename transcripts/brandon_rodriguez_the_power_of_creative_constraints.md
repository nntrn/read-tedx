title: The power of creative constraints
speaker: Brandon Rodriguez
description: >-
 Imagine you were asked to invent something new. It could be whatever you want,
 made from anything you choose, in any shape or size. That kind of creative
 freedom sounds so liberating, doesn't it? Or ... does it? if you're like most
 people you'd probably be paralyzed by this task. Why? Brandon Rodriguez explains
 how creative constraints actually help drive discovery and innovation. [Directed
 by BÃ¡lint Farkas Gelley, narrated by Addison Anderson].

Imagine you're asked to invent something new. It could be whatever you want made from
anything you choose in any shape or size. That kind of creative freedom sounds so
liberating, doesn't it? Or does it? If you're like most people, you'd probably be
paralyzed by this task. Without more guidance, where would you even begin? As it turns
out, boundless freedom isn't always helpful. In reality, any project is restricted by many
factors, such as the cost, what materials you have at your disposal, and unbreakable laws
of physics. These factors are called creative constraints, and they're the requirements 
and limitations we have to address in order to accomplish a goal. Creative constraints
apply across professions, to architects and artists, writers, engineers, and scientists.
In many fields, constraints play a special role as drivers of discovery and invention.
During the scientific process in particular, constraints are an essential part of
experimental design.

For instance, a scientist studying a new virus would consider, "How can I use the tools 
and techniques at hand to create an experiment that tells me how this virus infects the
body's cells? And what are the limits of my knowledge that prevent me from understanding 
this new viral pathway?" In engineering, constraints have us apply our scientific
discoveries to invent something new and useful. Take, for example, the landers Viking 1
and 2, which relied on thrusters to arrive safely on the surface of Mars. The problem?
Those thrusters left foreign chemicals on the ground, contaminating soil samples. So a new
constraint was introduced. How can we land a probe on Mars without introducing chemicals
from Earth? The next Pathfinder mission used an airbag system to allow the rover to bounce
and roll to a halt without burning contaminating fuel. Years later, we wanted to send a
much larger rover: Curiosity. However, it was too large for the airbag design, so another
constraint was defined.

How can we land a large rover while still keeping rocket fuel away from the Martian soil?
In response, engineers had a wild idea. They designed a skycrane. Similar to the claw
machine at toy stores, it would lower the rover from high above the surface. With each
invention, the engineers demonstrated an essential habit of scientific thinking - that
solutions must recognize the limitations of current technology in order to advance it.
Sometimes this progress is iterative, as in, "How can I make a better parachute to land my
rover?" And sometimes, it's innovative, like how to reach our goal when the best possible 
parachute isn't going to work. In both cases, the constraints guide decision-making to
ensure we reach each objective. Here's another Mars problem yet to be solved. Say we want
to send astronauts who will need water. They'd rely on a filtration system that keeps the
water very clean and enables 100% recovery.

Those are some pretty tough constraints, and we may not have the technology for it now.
But in the process of trying to meet these objectives, we might discover other
applications of any inventions that result. Building an innovative water filtration
system could provide a solution for farmers working in drought-stricken regions, or a way
to clean municipal water in polluted cities. In fact, many scientific advances have
occurred when serendipitous failures in one field address the constraints of another. When
scientist Alexander Fleming mistakenly contaminated a Petri dish in the lab, it led to the
discovery of the first antibiotic, penicillin. The same is true of synthetic dye,
plastic, and gunpowder. All were created mistakenly, but went on to address the
constraints of other problems. Understanding constraints guides scientific progress, and
what's true in science is also true in many other fields.

Constraints aren't the boundaries of creativity, but the foundation of
it.
