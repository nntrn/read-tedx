title: Forget Wi-Fi. Meet the new Li-Fi Internet
speaker: Harald Haas
description: >-
 What if we could use existing technologies to provide Internet access to the more
 than 4 billion people living in places where the infrastructure can't support it?
 Using off-the-shelf LEDs and solar cells, Harald Haas and his team have pioneered
 a new technology that transmits data using light, and it may just be the key to
 bridging the digital divide. Take a look at what the future of the Internet could
 look like.

I would like to demonstrate for the first time in public that it is possible to transmit a
video from a standard off-the-shelf LED lamp to a solar cell with a laptop acting as a
receiver. There is no Wi-Fi involved, it's just light. And you may wonder, what's the
point? And the point is this: There will be a massive extension of the Internet to close
the digital divide, and also to allow for what we call "The Internet of Things" — tens of
billions of devices connected to the Internet. In my view, such an extension of the
Internet can only work if it's almost energy-neutral. This means we need to use existing
infrastructure as much as possible. And this is where the solar cell and the LED come in. I
demonstrated for the first time, at TED in 2011, Li-Fi, or Light Fidelity. Li-Fi uses
off-the-shelf LEDs to transmit data incredibly fast, and also in a safe and secure manner.
Data is transported by the light, encoded in subtle changes of the brightness.

If we look around, we have many LEDs around us, so there's a rich infrastructure of Li-Fi
transmitters around us. But so far, we have been using special devices — small photo
detectors, to receive the information encoded in the data. I wanted to find a way to also
use existing infrastructure to receive data from our Li-Fi lights. And this is why I have
been looking into solar cells and solar panels. A solar cell absorbs light and converts it
into electrical energy. This is why we can use a solar cell to charge our mobile phone.
But now we need to remember that the data is encoded in subtle changes of the brightness
of the LED, so if the incoming light fluctuates, so does the energy harvested from the
solar cell. This means we have a principal mechanism in place to receive information from
the light and by the solar cell, because the fluctuations of the energy harvested
correspond to the data transmitted. Of course the question is: can we receive very fast and
subtle changes of the brightness, such as the ones transmitted by our LED
lights?

And the answer to that is yes, we can. We have shown in the lab that we can receive up to
50 megabytes per second from a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell. And this is faster than
most broadband connections these days. Now let me show you in practice. In this box is a
standard, off-the-shelf LED lamp. This is a standard, off-the-shelf solar cell; it is
connected to the laptop. And also we have an instrument here to visualize the energy we
harvest from the solar cell. And this instrument shows something at the moment. This is
because the solar cell already harvests light from the ambient light. Now what I would like
to do first is switch on the light, and I'll simply, only switch on the light, for a
moment, and what you'll notice is that the instrument jumps to the right. So the solar
cell, for a moment, is harvesting energy from this artificial light source. If I turn it
off, we see it drops. I turn it on ...

So we harvest energy with the solar cell. But next I would like to activate the streaming
of the video. And I've done this by pressing this button. So now this LED lamp here is
streaming a video by changing the brightness of the LED in a very subtle way, and in a way
that you can't recognize with your eye, because the changes are too fast to recognize. But
in order to prove the point, I can block the light of the solar cell. So first you notice
the energy harvesting drops and the video stops as well. If I remove the blockage, the
video will restart.

And I can repeat that. So we stop the transmission of the video and energy harvesting
stops as well. So that is to show that the solar cell acts as a receiver. But now imagine
that this LED lamp is a street light, and there's fog. And so I want to simulate fog, and
that's why I brought a handkerchief with me.

And let me put the handkerchief over the solar cell. First you notice the energy harvested
drops, as expected, but now the video still continues. This means, despite the blockage,
there's sufficient light coming through the handkerchief to the solar cell, so that the
solar cell is able to decode and stream that information, in this case, a high-definition
video. What's really important here is that a solar cell has become a receiver for
high-speed wireless signals encoded in light, while it maintains its primary function as
an energy-harvesting device. That's why it is possible to use existing solar cells on the
roof of a hut to act as a broadband receiver from a laser station on a close by hill, or
indeed, lamp post. And It really doesn't matter where the beam hits the solar cell. And the
same is true for translucent solar cells integrated into windows, solar cells integrated
into street furniture, or indeed, solar cells integrated into these billions of devices
that will form the Internet of Things.

Because simply, we don't want to charge these devices regularly, or worse, replace the
batteries every few months. As I said to you, this is the first time I've shown this in
public. It's very much a lab demonstration, a prototype. But my team and I are confident
that we can take this to market within the next two to three years. And we hope we will be
able to contribute to closing the digital divide, and also contribute to connecting all
these billions of devices to the Internet. And all of this without causing a massive
explosion of energy consumption — because of the solar cells, quite the opposite. Thank
you.
