I'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer, I'm not a choreographer — I'm actually a filmmaker,
a storyteller. I directed a movie two years ago called "Step Up 2: The Streets." Anybody?
Anybody? Yeah! During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers — amazing, the
best in the world — and they brought me into a society, the sort of underground street
culture that blew my mind. I mean, this is literally human beings with super-human
strength and abilities. They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way
back. They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row. I'd never seen anything like
that. When I was growing up, my heroes were people like Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael
Jackson. I grew up in a musical family. 

And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes. Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid
growing up in the Silicon Valley with low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in
something bigger. Those guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do that moonwalk at that
bar mitzvah tonight for that girl."

And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared, sort of relegated to the background
of pop stars and music videos. But after seeing what I've seen, the truth is, they have
not disappeared at all. They're here, getting better and better every day. And dance has
progressed. It is insane what dance is right now. Dance has never had a better friend than
technology. Online videos and social networking ... dancers have created a whole global
laboratory online for dance, where kids in Japan are taking moves from a YouTube video
created in Detroit, building on it within days and releasing a new video, while teenagers
in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it with a Philly flair to create
a whole new dance style in itself. And this is happening every day. And from these bedrooms
and living rooms and garages, with cheap webcams, lies the world's great dancers of
tomorrow. Our Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys our Michael Jacksons are right at our
fingertips, and may not have that opportunity, except for us. So, we created the LXD, sort
of a — the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers, a justice league of dancers that believe that
dance can have a transformative effect on the world.

A living, breathing comic book series, but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man, these guys can
actually do it. And we're going to show you some today. So, let me introduce to you, some
of our heroes right now. We got Madd Chadd, Lil' C, Kid David and J Smooth. Please be
excited, have fun, yell, scream. Ladies and gentlemen: The LXD.

: Madd Chadd: When people first see me, I get a lot of different reactions actually.
Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it, but sometimes they get a little
freaked out. And, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little
bit.

J Smooth: When I'm in the zone — I'm dancing and free styling it — I actually visually
kind of picture lines, and moving them. I think of like, Transformers, like how panels
open and then they fold, they fold in, and then you close that panel. And then another
thing opens, you close that.

Kid David: It's kind of like, honestly a lot of times I don't really know what's going on
when I'm dancing. Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.
It's not really a conscious decision, "I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this."
It's kind of like this other level where you can't make choices anymore, and it's just
your body reacting to certain sounds in the music. I got my name just because I was so
young. I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing
with. So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the
kid.

L'il C: I tell them to create a ball, and then you just use that ball of energy. And
instead of throwing it out, people would think that's a krump move, that's a krump move.
That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out, you throw it out, and you hold it.
And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail, you grab it by the tail, then you
bring it back in. And you just got this piece of energy and you just, you're manipulating
it. You know, you create power, then you tame it.
