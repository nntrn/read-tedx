It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well. You could see that Pierre did
truly love the mademoiselle. Oh, and now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel
bell. C'est la vie, say the old folks,it goes to show you never can tell. No, no. They
furnished off an apartment with a two-room Roebuck sale. The coolerator was crammed with TV
dinners and ginger ale. Oh, but when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out
well .C'est la vie, say the old folks,it goes to show you never can tell. You never can
tell. They bought a souped-up jitney, was a cherry red '53.They drove it down to New
Orleans to celebrate their anniversary. Oh, it was there where Pierre was wedded to the
lovely mademoiselle. C'est la vie, say the old folks,it goes to show you never can tell. No,
no, you never can tell. No, no, you never can tell. You never can tell. You never can
tell. No, no, you never can tell.(Applause and cheers)Thank you. I recently had the
tremendous opportunity of searching for gold in the vast mine of songs released by Chess
Records, a Chicago-based label that was really very active in the '50s and '60s in the US
and that music spread all over the world.

And the songs that I'm singing tonight are from an album that I just put out called,
"Playing Chess," that pays homage to those songs. And these guys were really the
innovators of rock 'n' roll and soul and R&B as we now know it.

Over the mountain, across the sea,there's a girl waiting,she's waiting for ...
me.

Over the river, beyond every cloud,she's passed the wind blowin' loud. Over the mountain, a
girl waits for me.

Tell the sands, every blade of grass,please tell the wind to let my love pass. Over the
mountain, a girl waits for me. Tell the moon up — up in the sky. Tell all the birds that fly
on bythat over and over the mountain ... my love waits for me. Oh, into each dark, starry
night,oh, what a mystery that's sealed so tight. Over the mountain, a girl waits for
me. Tell the moon up — up in the sky. Tell the birds that fly bythat over and over the
mountain my love waits for me. Into each dark and starry night,oh, what a mystery that's
sealed so tight. Over the mountains, a girl waits for me. She waits for me. Oh, she waits for
me. I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. Oh, I
know, I know, I know, I know, I know, oh oh, oh oh.(Applause and cheers)
