Schizophrenia was first identified more than a century ago, but we still don’t know its
exact causes. It remains one of the most misunderstood and stigmatized illnesses today.
So, let’s walk through what we do know— from symptoms to causes and treatments. Schizophrenia
is considered a syndrome, which means it may encompass a number of related disorders that
have similar symptoms but varying causes. Every person with schizophrenia has slightly
different symptoms, and the first signs can be easy to miss— subtle personality changes,
irritability, or a gradual encroachment of unusual thoughts. Patients are usually
diagnosed after the onset of psychosis, which typically occurs in the late teens or
early twenties for men and the late twenties or early thirties for women. A first
psychotic episode can feature delusions, hallucinations, and disordered speech and
behavior. These are called positive symptoms, meaning they occur in people with
schizophrenia but not in the general population.

It’s a common misperception that people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities,
but these symptoms indicate a disruption of thought processes, rather than the
manifestation of another personality. Schizophrenia also has negative symptoms, these are
qualities that are reduced in people with schizophrenia, such as motivation, expression
of emotion, or speech. There are cognitive symptoms as well, like difficulty
concentrating, remembering information, and making decisions. So what causes the onset of
psychosis? There likely isn’t one single cause, but a combination of genetic and
environmental risk factors that contribute. Schizophrenia has some of the strongest 
genetic links of any psychiatric illness. Though about 1% of people have schizophrenia,
children or siblings of people with schizophrenia are ten times likelier to develop the
disease, and an identical twin of someone with schizophrenia has a 40% chance of being
affected.

Often, immediate relatives of people with schizophrenia exhibit milder versions of traits
 associated with the disorder— but not to an extent that requires treatment. Multiple
genes almost certainly play a role, but we don’t know how many, or which
ones. Environmental factors like exposure to certain viruses in early infancy might
increase the chance that someone will develop schizophrenia, and use of some drugs, 
including marijuana, may trigger the onset of psychosis in highly susceptible individuals.
These factors don’t affect everyone the same way. For those with very low genetic risk,
no amount of exposure to environmental risk factors will lead them to develop
schizophrenia; for those with very high risk, moderate additional risk might tip the
balance. The antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia have helped researchers work
backwards to trace signatures of the disorder in the brain. Traditional antipsychotics 
block dopamine receptors.

They can be very effective in reducing positive symptoms, which are linked to an excess
of dopamine in particular brain pathways. But the same drugs can make negative symptoms
worse, and we’ve found that negative symptoms of schizophrenia may be tied to too little
dopamine in other brain areas. Some people with schizophrenia show a loss of neural
tissue, and it’s unclear whether this atrophy is a result of the disease itself or
drug-induced suppression of signaling. Fortunately, newer generations of antipsychotics
aim to address some of these issues by targeting multiple neurotransmitters, like
serotonin in addition to dopamine. It’s clear that no one transmitter system is
responsible for all symptoms, and because these drugs affect signaling throughout the
brain and body, they can have other side effects like weight gain. In spite of these
complications, antipsychotics can be very effective, especially when combined with other
interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Electroconvulsive therapy, though it provides relatively short-lived relief, is also
re-emerging as an effective treatment, especially when other options have failed. Early
intervention is also extremely important. After months or years of untreated psychosis,
certain psychoses can become embedded in someone’s personality. And yet, the dehumanizing
stigma attached to this diagnosis can prevent people from seeking help. People with
schizophrenia are often perceived as dangerous, but are actually much more likely to be
the victims of violence than the perpetrators. And proper treatment may help reduce the
likelihood of violence associated with schizophrenia. That’s why education— for patients, 
their families, and their communities— helps erode the stigma and improves access to
treatment.
