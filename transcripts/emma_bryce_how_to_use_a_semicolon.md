It may seem like the semicolon is struggling with an identity crisis. It looks like a
comma crossed with a period. Maybe that's why we toss these punctuation marks around like
grammatical confetti. We're confused about how to use them properly. In fact, it's the
semicolon's half-half status that makes it useful. It's stronger than a comma, and less
final than a period. It fills the spaces in between, and for that reason, it has some
specific and important tasks. For one, it can clarify ideas in a sentence that's already
festooned with commas. "Semicolons: At first, they may seem frightening, then, they
become enlightening, finally, you'll find yourself falling for these delightful
punctuation marks." Even though the commas separate different parts of the sentence, it's
easy to lose track of what belongs where. But then the semicolon edges in to the rescue.
In list-like sentences, it can exert more force than commas do, cutting sentences into
compartments and grouping items that belong together.

The semicolon breaks things up, but it also builds connections. Another of its tasks is to
link together independent clauses. These are sentences that can stand on their own, but
when connected by semicolons, look and sound better because they're related in some way.
"Semicolons were once a great mystery to me. I had no idea where to put them."
Technically, there's nothing wrong with that. These two sentences can stand alone. But
imagine they appeared in a long list of other sentences, all of the same length, each
separated by periods. Things would get monotonous very fast. In that situation, semicolons
bring fluidity and variation to writing by connecting related clauses. But as beneficial
as they are, semicolons don't belong just anywhere. There are two main rules that govern
their use. Firstly, unless they're being used in lists, semicolons should only connect
clauses that are related in some way.

You wouldn't use one here, for instance: "Semicolons were once a great mystery to me; I'd
really like a sandwich." Periods work best here because these are two totally different
ideas. A semicolon's job is to reunite two independent clauses that will benefit from 
one another's company because they refer to the same thing. Secondly, you'll almost never
find a semicolon willingly stationed before coordinating conjunctions: the words, "and,"
"but," "for," "nor," "or," "so," and "yet." That's a comma's place, in fact. But a
semicolon can replace a conjunction to shorten a sentence or to give it some variety.
Ultimately, this underappreciated punctuation mark can give writing clarity, force, and
style, all encompassed in one tiny dot and squiggle that's just waiting to be put in the
right place.
