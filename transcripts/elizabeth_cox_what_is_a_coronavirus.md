For almost a decade, scientists chased the source of a deadly new virus through China’s
tallest mountains and most isolated caverns. They finally found it here: in the bats of
Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic of severe
acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003.Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered
in little protein spikes that look like a crown— or "corona" in Latin. There are hundreds
 of known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, and can cause disease. The
coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, MERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes the
disease COVID-19.Of the seven human coronaviruses, four cause colds, mild, highly
contagious infections of the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, and cause much more
severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, has features of each: it spreads
easily, but can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, droplets
containing the virus spray out.

The virus can infect a new person when the droplets enter their nose or mouth.
Coronaviruses transmit best in enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold
weather keeps their delicate casing from drying out, enabling the virus to survive for
longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight may damage it. These seasonal
variations matter more for established viruses. But because no one is yet immune to a
new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it doesn’t need ideal conditions to
spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed in the host’s cells and fuse with them—
enabling the virus to hijack the host cell’s machinery to replicate its own
genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses or DNA
viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, with fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts
 and replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have a proofreading
mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do.

So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have mistakes called
mutations. Many of these mutations are useless or even harmful. But some make the virus
better suited for certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur
when a virus jumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses that caused
the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus
still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, 
or strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences from most RNA
viruses. They’re some of the largest, meaning they have the most genes. That creates more
opportunity for harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, coronaviruses have a unique
feature: an enzyme that checks for replication errors and corrects mistakes. This makes
coronaviruses much more stable, with a slower mutation rate, than other RNA
viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate is actually a promising
sign when it comes to disarming them.

After an infection, our immune systems can recognize germs and destroy them more quickly 
if they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus less
recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can
also make antiviral drugs and vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored very
specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine every year— the influenza
virus mutates so quickly that new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate of
coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, and vaccines might be able to recognize
them for longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how
long our bodies remain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved
treatment or vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating the ones that
cause colds, and though scientists began developing treatments for SARS and MERS, the
epidemics ended before those treatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to
encroach on other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus jumping to
humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, it doesn’t have to be
devastating.
