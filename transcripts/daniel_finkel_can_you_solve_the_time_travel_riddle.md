title: Can you solve the time travel riddle?
speaker: Daniel Finkel
description: >-
 Your professor has accidentally stepped through a time portal in his physics lab.
 You've got just a minute to jump through before it closes and leaves him stranded
 in history. Your only way back is to grab enough colored nodules to create a new
 portal to open a doorway through time. Can you take the right amount of nodules
 to get back to the present before the portal closes? Dan Finkel shows how.

Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s physics lab has been amazing. Until, that is, the
professor accidentally stepped through a time portal. You’ve got just a minute to jump
through the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Once
you’re through it, the portal will close, and your only way back will be to create a new
one using the chrono-nodules from your lab. Activated nodules connect to each other via
red or blue tachyon entanglement. Activate more nodules and they’ll connect to all other
nodules in the area. As soon as a red or blue triangle is created with a nodule at each
point, it opens a doorway through time that will take you back to the present. But the
color of each individual connection manifests at random, and there’s no way to choose or
change its color. And there’s one more problem: each individual nodule creates a temporal
instability that raises the chances the portal might collapse as you go through
it.

So the fewer you bring, the better. The portal’s about to close. What’s the minimum
number of nodules you need to bring to be certain you’ll create a red or blue triangle
and get back to the present? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer
in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1This question is so rich that an entire branch of
mathematics known as Ramsey Theory developed from it. Ramsey Theory is home to some
famously difficult problems. This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled if you approach
it systematically. Imagine you brought just three nodules. Would that be enough? No - for
example, you might have two blue and one red connection, and be stuck in the past forever.
Would four nodules be enough? No - there are many arrangements here that don’t give a blue
or red triangle. What about five? It turns out there is an arrangement of connections
that avoids creating a blue or red triangle.

These smaller triangles don’t count because they don’t have a nodule at each
corner. However, six nodules will always create a blue triangle or a red triangle. Here’s
how we can prove that without sorting through every possible case. Imagine activating the
sixth nodule, and consider how it might connect to the other five. It could do so in one
of six ways: with five red connections, five blue connections, or some mix of red and
blue. Notice that every possibility has at least three connections of the same color
coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules on the other end of those same
three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue
connection between those three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get
in trouble is if all the connections between them were red. But those three red
connections would give us a red triangle. No matter what happens, we’ll get a red or a
blue triangle, and open our doorway.

 On the other hand, if the original three connections were all red instead of blue, the
same argument still works, with all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the
connections are colored, six nodules will always create a red or blue triangle and a
doorway leading home. So you grab six nodules and jump through the portal. You were hoping
your internship would give you valuable life experience. Turns out, that didn’t take much
time.
