Chris Anderson: And now we go live to Caracas to see one of Maestro Abreu's great
proteges. He is the new musical director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. He's
the greatest young conductor in the world. Gustavo Dudamel! 

Gustavo Dudamel: Hi everybody in L.A. Hi Quincy. Hi Maestro Zander. Hi Mark. We are
very happy to have the possibility to be with you in the other side of the world. We can
speak only with music. We are very happy because we have the opportunity to have this
angel in the world — not only in our country, Venezuela, but in our world. He has given
us the possibility to have dreams and to make true the dreams. And here are the results
of this wonderful project that is The System in Venezuela. We hope to have, our Maestro,
 to have orchestras in all the countries in all Americas. And we want to play a little
piece for you by one of the most important composers of America. A Mexican composer:
Arturo Marquez. "Danzon No. 2."
