title: The awful logic of land mines -- and an app that helps people avoid them
speaker: Carlos Bautista
description: >-
 Fifty years of armed conflict in Colombia has left the countryside riddled with
 land mines that maim and kill innocent people who happen across them. To help
 keep communities safe from harm, TED Resident Carlos Bautista is developing an
 app to track land mines -- and direct travelers away from them. Learn more about
 how this potentially life-saving tool could promote peace in countries plagued by
 land mines once conflicts end.

When you walk around the place where you live, most of the times, you feel pretty safe and
comfortable, right? Now imagine if there were land mines buried right here, scattered
around, and you'd never know when you might step on one. That's how it is for many in my
home country, Colombia. As a result of a 50-year internal armed conflict, we have an
undetermined number of land mines buried throughout the countryside, affecting more than
one third of the Colombian population. These anti-personnel mines are designed to maim,
not to kill their targets. The logic behind this, which is awful, is that more resources
are taken up caring for an injured soldier than dealing with a person who has been
killed. I met Adriana Rodriguez about five years ago while I was working for the Colombian
government as a documentary filmmaker. During the conflict, she was forced to leave her
house ... with her kids in her arms. One day, one of her neighbors was killed while he
stepped on a land mine.

He was actually inside an abandoned house, not outside, a house exactly like the one
Adriana was forced to leave. Ever since, she has been living with the fear that she, or
her children, might step on a land mine. You know, the Colombian conflict has been running
for so long that neither me nor my mom have seen our country in peace, and for someone
like me, who has been living detached from all this suffering, there was only two options:
either I get used to it, or I can try to change it with all my heart. And I have to admit
that for almost 30 years, I was getting used to it, you know? But something changed for me
when I met my wife. She is a political scientist completely passionate about the Colombian
armed conflict. She helped me to understand how deeply our country has been affected by
land mines and by war. We decided to come here to the United States in search of new
skills that would enable us to contribute in a fair way to our society, and maybe even
help heal it. While in grad school, I started developing an augmented reality, really broad
application to help military personnel to deactivate land mines more safely.

During that time, I also realized that Colombia is not the only country in the world that
has to worry about land mines. In fact, more than 58 countries are still contaminated with
any sort of explosive device. Only in 2015, due to an escalation of war in countries like
Libya, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen, the number of [land mine casualties] almost doubled, from
3,695 to 6,461 people. Imagine that. While some countries are trying to get rid of land
mines, some others are increasing their use. But what happens when a conflict that involved
land mines comes to an end? There are two consequences. On the one hand, the internally
displaced population will start returning to their lands, and on the other hand, hidden
land mines are going to start exploding more often on the civilian side. That's the reason
why I decided to join the Computer Science Department at NYU, along with Professor Claudio
Silva to start to develop an app called MineSafe.

MineSafe uses information from the community to suggest paths that have been declared as
the most transited without accident or incident caused by a land mine. These traffic
patterns can also be used to determine the top priority zones to be de-mined. Almost 15
million people are living now in the countryside of Colombia. Imagine, for a moment, if we
can crowdsource information from all of them to help people like Adriana and her children
to find safe and reliable paths. This information can not only be used for that. This
information can also help them to become more productive. Farmers will be able to find
which lands have been cleared from explosive devices, and in that way, they will be able
to find new, fertile grounds to start growing food again. MineSafe has now a partnership
with the Colombian government for the initial pilot, and we have now some connections with
Cambodia and Somalia as well.

This project is being funded by private money here in the United States, but we don't want
to stop here. We want to go big, and we want to scale the project to every single place
where land mines are still a threat. The Colombian armed conflict is finally coming to an
end, but the consequences of years of war are still buried under our feet. We at MineSafe
are working to help both people and land to find peace. Thank you.
