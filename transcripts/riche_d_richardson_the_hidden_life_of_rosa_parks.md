In 1944, 11 years before her fateful decision on a Montgomery Bus, Rosa Parks was
investigating a vicious crime. As an emissary for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, she had traveled to rural Alabama to meet with Recy
Taylor, a young woman who had been sexually assaulted by six white men. It would be
difficult enough to convince an Alabama court that even one of these men was guilty, but
Rosa was undeterred. She formed a committee to defend Recy in court, flooding the media
with testimony and sparking protests throughout the South. When a jury failed to indict
the attackers, Parks demanded the governor assemble a new grand jury. She wrote, “I know
that you will not fail to let the people of Alabama know that there is equal justice for
all of our citizens.”Throughout her life, Parks repeatedly challenged racial violence and
the prejudiced systems protecting its perpetrators.

But this work came at an enormous risk— and a personal price. Born in 1913, Rosa was raised
by her mother and grandparents in rural Alabama. But outside this loving home, the fear 
of racial violence cast a long shadow. The Ku Klux Klan frequently drove past their home,
and Jim Crow laws segregated public spaces. At 19 she settled in Montgomery and married
Raymond Parks, a barber who shared her growing fury at racial injustice. He was involved
with the local chapter of the NAACP; a role many avoided for fear of persecution. At first
Raymond was eager to keep Rosa safe from the potential dangers of activism. But as she
grew more incensed at the limitations imposed on African Americans, she could no longer
stand by. When she officially joined the NAACP in 1943, Parks and Johnnie Rebecca Carr
were the only women in the Montgomery chapter. She began keeping minutes for their
meetings, and soon found herself elected secretary of the chapter— formally beginning her
secret double life. By day, Rosa worked as a seamstress to support her mother and
husband.

By night, she researched and documented numerous civil rights cases, from local policy
disputes to high-profile murder cases and hate crimes. As secretary, she prepared public 
responses on behalf of the Montgomery chapter, battling the harsh sentencing, false
accusation and smear campaigns frequently used against African Americans. In addition to
her legal work, Parks was a brilliant local strategist. As advisor to the NAACP youth
group council, she helped young people navigate segregated systems including voter
registration and whites-only libraries. Through the cover of the NAACP, Parks strived to
bring clandestine civil rights activities into the open. She advocated for civil
disobedience training and spoke out against racial violence, particularly the murder of
Emmet Till. In 1955, her refusal to move to the back of a segregated bus helped ignite the
grassroots movement she had hoped for.

Parks was arrested and jailed for her one-woman protest, where she was visited by local
activists. Together they planned a twenty-four hour bus boycott. It lasted for three
hundred and eighty-one days. Park’s simple act had transformed nascent civil rights
activism into a national movement. In 1956, the boycott ended when the Supreme Court
ruled in favor of desegregating public transport. But this victory for the movement had
come at a great cost. Rosa had been receiving vicious death threats throughout the
campaign, and was unable to find work in Montgomery because of her political reputation. In
1957, she moved to Detroit to continue working as a seamstress, until being hired by
Congressman John Conyers to help support his burgeoning civil rights campaigns. Ever
vigilant in the fight against racial inequality, Parks remained active for the next 40
years. She wrote several books, traveled across the country giving talks to support other
activists, and established an institute for the education of young people in her late
husband’s memory.

Today, Rosa Parks is remembered as a radical spirit who railed against the most powerful 
people and policies. Her call to action continues to resound: “knowing what must be done
does away with fear.”
