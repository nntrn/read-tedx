title: This is what enduring love looks like
speaker: Alec Soth and Stacey Baker
description: >-
 Stacey Baker has always been obsessed with how couples meet. When she asked
 photographer Alec Soth to help her explore this topic, they found themselves at
 the world's largest speed-dating event, held in Las Vegas on Valentine's Day, and
 at the largest retirement community in Nevada — with Soth taking portraits of
 pairs in each locale. Between these two extremes, they unwound a beautiful
 through-line of how a couple goes from meeting to creating a life together. (This
 talk was part of a TED2015 session curated by Pop-Up Magazine: popupmagazine.com

Alec Soth: So about 10 years ago, I got a call from a woman in Texas, Stacey Baker, and
she'd seen some of my photographs in an art exhibition and was wondering if she could
commission me to take a portrait of her parents. Now, at the time I hadn't met Stacey, and
I thought this was some sort of wealthy oil tycoon and I'd struck it rich, but it was only
later that I found out she'd actually taken out a loan to make this happen. I took the
picture of her parents, but I was actually more excited about photographing Stacey. The
picture I made that day ended up becoming one of my best-known portraits. At the time I
made this picture, Stacey was working as an attorney for the State of Texas. Not long
after, she left her job to study photography in Maine, and while she was there, she ended
up meeting the director of photography at the New York Times Magazine and was actually
offered a job. Stacey Baker: In the years since, Alec and I have done a number of magazine
projects together, and we've become friends. A few months ago, I started talking to Alec
about a fascination of mine.

I've always been obsessed with how couples meet. I asked Alec how he and his wife Rachel
met, and he told me the story of a high school football game where she was 16 and he was
15, and he asked her out. He liked her purple hair. She said yes, and that was it. I then
asked Alec if he'd be interested in doing a photography project exploring this
question. AS: And I was interested in the question, but I was actually much more interested
in Stacey's motivation for asking it, particularly since I'd never known Stacey to have a
boyfriend. So as part of this project, I thought it'd be interesting if she tried to meet
someone. So my idea was to have Stacey here go speed dating in Las Vegas on Valentine's
Day. 

SB: We ended up at what was advertised as the world's largest speed dating event. I had 19
dates and each date lasted three minutes. Participants were given a list of ice- breaker
questions to get the ball rolling, things like, "If you could be any kind of animal, what
would you be?" That sort of thing. My first date was Colin. He's from England, and he once
married a woman he met after placing an ad for a Capricorn. Alec and I saw him at the end
of the evening, and he said he'd kissed a woman in line at one of the concession
stands. Zack and Chris came to the date-a-thon together. This is Carl. I asked Carl, "What's
the first thing you notice about a woman?" He said, "Tits." 

Matthew is attracted to women with muscular calves. We talked about running. He does
triathlons, I run half-marathons. Alec actually liked his eyes and asked if I was
attracted to him, but I wasn't, and I don't think he was attracted to me either. Austin and
Mike came together. Mike asked me a hypothetical question. He said, "You're in an elevator
running late for a meeting. Someone makes a dash for the elevator. Do you hold it open for
them?" And I said I would not. 

Cliff said the first thing he notices about a woman is her teeth, and we complimented each
other's teeth. Because he's an open mouth sleeper, he says he has to floss more to help
prevent gum disease, and so I asked him how often he flosses, and he said, "Every other
day." 

Now, as someone who flosses twice a day, I wasn't really sure that that was flossing more
but I don't think I said that out loud. Bill is an auditor, and we talked the entire three
minutes about auditing. 

The first thing Spencer notices about a woman is her complexion. He feels a lot of women
wear too much makeup, and that they should only wear enough to accentuate the features
that they have. I told him I didn't wear any makeup at all and he seemed to think that
that was a good thing. Craig told me he didn't think I was willing to be vulnerable. He
was also frustrated when I couldn't remember my most embarrassing moment. He thought I was
lying, but I wasn't. I didn't think he liked me at all, but at the end of the night, he
came back to me and he gave me a box of chocolates. William was really difficult to talk
to. I think he was drunk. 

Actor Chris McKenna was the MC of the event. He used to be on "The Young and the
Restless." I didn't actually go on a date with him. Alec said he saw several women give
their phone numbers to him. Needless to say, I didn't fall in love. I didn't feel a
particular connection with any of the men that I went on dates with, and I didn't feel
like they felt a particular connection with me either. AS: Now, the most beautiful thing to
me — 

— as a photographer is the quality of vulnerability. The physical exterior reveals a crack
in which you can get a glimpse at a more fragile interior. At this date-a-thon event, I
saw so many examples of that, but as I watched Stacey's dates and talked to her about
them, I realized how different photographic love is from real love. What is real love? How
does it work? In order to work on this question and to figure out how someone goes from
meeting on a date to having a life together, Stacey and I went to Sun City Summerlin,
which is the largest retirement community in Las Vegas. Our contact there was George, who
runs the community's photography club. He arranged for us to meet other couples in their
makeshift photo studio. SB: After 45 years of marriage, Anastasia's husband died two years
ago,so we asked if she had an old wedding picture. She met her husband when she was a
15-year-old waitress at a small barbecue place in Michigan. He was 30. She'd lied about
her age.

He was the first person she'd dated. Dean had been named photographer of the year in Las
Vegas two years in a row, and this caught Alec's attention, as did the fact that he met
his wife, Judy, at the same age when Alec met Rachel. Dean admitted that he likes to look
at beautiful women, but he's never questioned his decision to marry Judy. AS: George met
Josephine at a parish dance. He was 18, she was 15. Like a lot of the couples we met, they
weren't especially philosophical about their early choices. George said something that
really stuck with me. He said, "When you get that feeling, you just go with it."Bob and
Trudy met on a blind date when she was still in high school. They said they weren't
particularly attracted to each other when the first met. Nevertheless, they were married
soon after. SB: The story that stayed with me the most was that of George, the photography
club president, and his wife, Mary. This was George and Mary's second marriage.

They met at a country-western club in Louisville, Kentucky called the Sahara. He was there
alone drinking and she was with friends. When they started dating, he owed the IRS 9,000
dollars in taxes, and she offered to help him get out of debt, so for the next year, he
turned his paychecks over to Mary, and she got him out of debt. George was actually an
alcoholic when they married, and Mary knew it. At some point in their marriage, he says he
consumed 54 beers in one day. Another time, when he was drunk, he threatened to kill Mary
and her two kids, but they escaped and a SWAT team was called to the house. Amazingly,
Mary took him back, and eventually things got better. George has been involved in
Alcoholics Anonymous and hasn't had a drink in 36 years.

At the end of the day, after we left Sun City, I told Alec that I didn't actually think
that the stories of how these couples met were all that interesting. What was more
interesting was how they managed to stay together. AS: They all had this beautiful quality
of endurance, but that was true of the singles, too. The world is hard, and the singles
were out there trying to connect with other people, and the couples were holding onto each
other after all these decades. My favorite pictures on this trip were of Joe and Roseanne.
Now, by the time we met Joe and Roseanne, we'd gotten in the habit of asking couples if
they had an old wedding photograph. In their case, they simultaneously pulled out of their
wallets the exact same photograph. What's more beautiful, I thought to myself, this image
of a young couple who has just fallen in love or the idea of these two people holding onto
this image for decades? Thank you.
