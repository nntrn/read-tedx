title: Medical tech designed to meet Africa's needs
speaker: Soyapi Mumba
description: >-
 In sub-Saharan Africa, power outages, low technology penetration, slow internet
 and understaffed hospitals plague health care systems. To make progress on these
 problems in Malawi, TED Fellow Soyapi Mumba and his team created a new system
 from scratch -- from the software that powers their electronic health records to
 the infrastructure used to support it. In this quick, hopeful talk, Mumba shares
 how his jack-of-all-trades mindset can help reshape health care in low-resource
 environments.

Like every passionate software engineer out there, I closely follow technology companies
in Silicon Valley, pretty much the same way soccer fans follow their teams in Europe. I
read articles on tech blogs and listen to podcasts on my phone. But after I finish the
article, lock my phone and unplug the headphones, I'm back in sub-Saharan Africa, where
the landscape is not quite the same. We have long and frequent power outages, low
penetration of computers, slow internet connections and a lot of patients visiting
understaffed hospitals. Since the HIV epidemic, hospitals have been struggling to manage
regular HIV treatment records for increasing volumes of patients. For such environments,
importing technology systems developed elsewhere has not worked, but in 2006, I joined
Baobab Health, a team that uses locally based engineers to develop suitable interventions
that are addressing health care challenges in Malawi. We designed an electronic health
record system that is used by health care workers while seeing patients.

And in the process we realized that we not only had to design the software, we had to
implement the infrastructure as well. We don't have enough medical staff to
comprehensively examine every patient, so we embedded clinical guidelines within the
software to guide nurses and clerks who assist with handling some of the workload. Everyone
has a birthday, but not everyone knows their birthday, so we wrote algorithms to handle
estimated birthdates as complete dates. How do we follow up patients living in slums with
no street and house numbers? We used landmarks to approximate their physical
addresses. Malawi had no IDs to uniquely identify patients, so we had to implement unique
patient IDs to link patient records across clinics. The IDs are printed as barcodes on
labels that are stuck on personal health booklets kept by each patient. With this barcoded
ID, a simple scan with a barcode reader quickly pulls up the patient's
records.

No need to rewrite their personal details on paper registers at every visit. And suddenly,
queues became shorter. This meant patients, typically mothers with little children on
their backs, had to spend less time waiting to be assisted. And if they lose their
booklets, their records can still be pulled by searching with their names. Now, the way we
pronounce and spell names varies tremendously. We freely mix R's and L's, English and
vernacular versions of their names. Even soundex, a standard method for grouping words by
how similar they sound, was not good enough. So we had to modify it to help us link and
match existing records. Before the iPhone, software engineers developed for personal
computers, but from our experience, we knew our power system is not reliable enough for
personal computers. So we repurposed touch screen point-of-sale terminals that are meant
for retail shops to become clinical workstations.

At the time, we imported internet appliances called i-Openers that were manufactured
during the dot-com era by a failed US company. We modified their screens to add touch
sensors and their power system to run from rechargeable batteries. When we started, we
didn't find a reliable network to transmit data, especially from rural hospitals. So we
built our own towers, created a wireless network and linked clinics in Lilongwe, Malawi's
capital.

With a team of engineers working within a hospital campus, we observed health care workers
use the system and iteratively build an information system that is now managing HIV
records in all major public hospitals in Malawi. These are hospitals serving over 2,000
HIV patients, each clinic. Now, health care workers who used to spend days to tally and
prepare quarterly reports are producing the same reports within minutes, and health care
experts from all over the world are now coming to Malawi to learn how we did
it.

It is inspiring and fun to follow technology trends across the globe, but to make them
work in low-resourced environments like public hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa, we have
had to become jacks-of-all-trades and build whole systems, including the infrastructure,
from the ground up. Thank you.
