Chris Anderson: William, hi. Good to see you. William Kamkwamba: Thanks. CA: So, we've got a
picture, I think? Where is this? WK: This is my home. This is where I live. CA: Where? What
country? WK: In Malawi, Kasungu. In Kasungu. Yeah, Mala. CA: OK. Now, you're 19 now? WK:
Yeah. I'm 19 years now. CA: Five years ago you had an idea. What was that? WK: I wanted to
make a windmill. CA: A windmill? WK: Yeah. CA: What, to power — for lighting and stuff? WK:
Yeah. CA: So what did you do? How did you realize that? WK: After I dropped out of school, I
went to library, and I read a book that would — "Using Energy," and I get information
about doing the mill. And I tried, and I made it.

CA: So you copied — you exactly copied the design in the book. WK: Ah, no. I just —CA: What
happened? WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book, it has got four — ah
— three blades, and mine has got four blades. CA: The book had three, yours had four. WK:
Yeah. CA: And you made it out of what? WK: I made four blades, just because I want to
increase power. CA: OK.WK: Yeah. CA: You tested three, and found that four worked better? WK:
Yeah. I test. CA: And what did you make the windmill out of? What materials did you use? WK:
I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls —CA: Do we have a
picture of that? Can we have the next slide? WK: Yeah. The windmill. CA: And so, and that
windmill, what — it worked? WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates. CA: How much
electricity? WK: 12 watts. CA: And so, that lit a light for the house? How many lights? WK:
Four bulbs and two radios. CA: Wow. WK: Yeah.

CA: Next slide — so who's that? WK: This is my parents, holding the radio. CA: So what did
they make of — that you were 14, 15 at the time — what did they make of this? They were
impressed? WK: Yeah. CA: And so what's your — what are you going to do with this? WK: Um —CA:
What do you — I mean — do you want to build another one? WK: Yeah, I want to build another
one — to pump water and irrigation for crops. CA: So this one would have to be bigger? WK:
Yeah. CA: How big? WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts. CA: So that would
produce irrigation for the entire village? WK: Yeah. CA: Wow. And so you're talking to
people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this
dream? WK: Yeah, if they can help me with materials, yeah. CA: And as you think of your life
going forward, you're 19 now, do you picture continuing with this dream of working in
energy? WK: Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy. CA: Wow.

William, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference. Thank you so much for
coming. WK: Thank you.
