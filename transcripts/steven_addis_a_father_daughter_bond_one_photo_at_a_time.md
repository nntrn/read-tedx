title: A father-daughter bond, one photo at a time
speaker: Steven Addis
description: >-
 A long time ago in New York City, Steve Addis stood on a corner holding his
 1-year-old daughter in his arms; his wife snapped a photo. The image has inspired
 an annual father-daughter ritual, where Addis and his daughter pose for the same
 picture, on the same corner, each year. Addis shares 15 treasured photographs
 from the series, and explores why this small, repeated ritual means so much.

Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera, but today
I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine, and I didn't take any of
them. There were no art directors, no stylists, no chance for reshoots, not even any
regard for lighting. In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists. My story begins
when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement, and my wife took this picture of me
holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th. We
happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same
picture. Well you can see where this is going. Approaching my daughter's third birthday, my
wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter
trip, and continue the ritual?" This is when we started asking passing tourists to take
the picture. You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera
to a total stranger.

No one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera. Back then, we had
no idea how much this trip would change our lives. It's really become sacred to us. This
one was taken just weeks after 9/11, and I found myself trying to explain what had
happened that day in ways a five-year-old could understand. So these photos are far more
than proxies for a single moment, or even a specific trip. They're also ways for us to
freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year
to year, and not just physically, but in every way. Because while we take the same photo,
our perspectives change, and she reaches new milestones, and I get to see life through her
eyes, and how she interacts with and sees everything. This very focused time we get to
spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year. Recently, on one
trip, we were walking, and she stops dead in her tracks, and she points to a red awning of
the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips.

And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact
spot. She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place
for the very first time nine years earlier. And now what she's looking at in New York are
colleges, because she's determined to go to school in New York. And it hit me: One of the
most important things we all make are memories. So I want to share the idea of taking an
active role in consciously creating memories. I don't know about you, but aside from these
15 shots, I'm not in many of the family photos. I'm always the one taking the picture. So
I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot, and don't hesitate to go up to
someone and ask, "Will you take our picture?" Thank you.
