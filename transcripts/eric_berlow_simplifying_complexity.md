speaker: Eric Berlow
description: >-
 Ecologist Eric Berlow doesn't feel overwhelmed when faced with complex systems.
 He knows that more information can lead to a better, simpler solution. Illustrating
 the tips and tricks for breaking down big issues, he distills an overwhelming
 infographic on U.S. strategy in Afghanistan to a few elementary points.

Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you're faced with a complex problem? Well, I
hope to change that in less than three minutes. So, I hope to convince you that complex
doesn't always equal complicated. So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the
oven, is complex, but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread is complicated. I'm an
ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity. And I study that in the natural
world, the interconnectedness of species. So here's a food web, or a map of feeding links
between species that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California. And this is what
happens to that food web when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there
before. All the grayed-out species disappear. Some are actually on the brink of
extinction. And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them. These
effects were all unanticipated, and yet we're discovering they're predictable. So I want to
share with you a couple key insights about complexity we're learning from studying nature
that maybe are applicable to other problems.

First is the simple power of good visualization tools to help untangle complexity and just
encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before. For example, you could plot the
flow of carbon through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem, or the
interconnections of habitat patches for endangered species in Yosemite National Park. The
next thing is that if you want to predict the effect of one species on another, if you
focus only on that link, and then you black box the rest, it's actually less predictable
than if you step back, consider the entire system — all the species, all the links — and
from that place, hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most. And we're
discovering, with our research, that's often very local to the node you care about within
one or two degrees. So the more you step back, embrace complexity, the better chance you
have of finding simple answers, and it's often different than the simple answer that you
started with. So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the
U.S.

government. This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan. It
was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago. Instantly ridiculed by the media
for being so crazy complicated. And the stated goal was to increase popular support for
the Afghan government. Clearly a complex problem, but is it complicated? Well, when I saw
this in the front page of the Times, I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to.
I can sink my teeth into this."So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever, a
world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network. The circled node is
the one we're trying to influence — popular support for the government. And so now we can
look one degrees, two degrees, three degrees away from that node and eliminate
three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence. Within that sphere, most
of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain, and a very small
minority are actual military actions.

Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories: active engagement with
ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs and fair, transparent economic development and
provisioning of services. I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from
this diagram in 24 seconds. When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be
afraid. I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved. Because simple answers may
emerge. We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies on the other side of
complexity. So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity, the
better chance you have of zooming in on the simple details that matter most. Thank
you.
