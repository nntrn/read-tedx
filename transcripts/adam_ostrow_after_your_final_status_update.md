title: After your final status update
speaker: Adam Ostrow
description: >-
 Many of us have a social media presence -- a virtual personality made up of
 status updates, tweets and connections, stored in the cloud. Adam Ostrow asks a
 big question: What happens to that personality after you've died? Could it ...
 live on?

By the end of this year, there'll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively
use social networking sites. The one thing that all of them have in common is that they're
going to die. While that might be a somewhat morbid thought, I think it has some really
profound implications that are worth exploring. What first got me thinking about this was a
blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller, who was a science and technology
journalist who died of cancer. And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a
post that went out shortly after he died. Here's what he wrote in starting that out. He
said, "Here it is. I'm dead, and this is my last post to my blog. In advance, I asked that
once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer, then my family and
friends publish this prepared message I wrote — the first part of the process of turning
this from an active website to an archive."Now, while as a journalist, Miller's archive
may have been better written and more carefully curated than most, the fact of the matter
is that all of us today are creating an archive that's something completely different than
anything that's been created by any previous generation. Consider a few stats for a
moment.

Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute. There
are 200 million Tweets being posted every day. And the average Facebook user is creating
90 pieces of content each month. So when you think about your parents or your
grandparents, at best they may have created some photos or home videos, or a diary that
lives in a box somewhere. But today we're all creating this incredibly rich digital
archive that's going to live in the cloud indefinitely, years after we're gone. And I
think that's going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for
technologists. Now to be clear, I'm a journalist and not a technologist, so what I'd like
to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look
like. Now we're already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what
happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die.

One of them actually, fittingly enough, found me when I checked into a deli at a
restaurant in New York on foursquare.

Adam Ostrow: Hello. Death: Adam? AO: Yeah. Death: Death can catch you anywhere, anytime,
even at the Organic. AO: Who is this? Death: Go to ifidie.net before it's too
late.

Adam Ostrow: Kind of creepy, right? So what that service does, quite simply, is let you
create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die. Another service
right now is called 1,000 Memories. And what this lets you do is create an online tribute
to your loved ones, complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after
you die. But what I think comes next is far more interesting. Now a lot of you are probably
familiar with Deb Roy who, back in March, demonstrated how he was able to analyze more
than 90,000 hours of home video. I think as machines' ability to understand human language
and process vast amounts of data continues to improve, it's going to become possible to
analyze an entire life's worth of content — the Tweets, the photos, the videos, the blog
posts — that we're producing in such massive numbers. And I think as that happens, it's
going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real
world long after we're gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we're creating
and technology's ability to make sense of it all. Now we're already starting to see some
experiments here.

One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream, everything you've
posted onto Twitter, to make some predictions as to what you might say next. Well right
now, as you can see, the results can be somewhat comical. You can imagine what something
like this might look like five, 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities
improve. Taking it a step further, MIT's media lab is working on robots that can interact
more like humans. But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique
characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of
content that person produces in their lifetime? Finally, think back to this famous scene
from election night 2008 back in the United States, where CNN beamed a live hologram of
hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper. What if
we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved
ones into our living rooms — interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content
they created while they were alive?

I think that's going to become completely possible as the amount of data we're producing
and technology's ability to understand it both expand exponentially. Now in closing, I
think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality — and
if so, what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it. Thank
you very much.
