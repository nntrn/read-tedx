title: To transform child welfare, take race out of the equation
speaker: Jessica Pryce
description: >-
 In this eye-opening talk about the impact of race and neighborhood on foster-care
 decisions, social worker Jessica Pryce shares a promising solution to help child
 welfare agencies make bias-free assessments about when to remove children from
 their families. "Let's work together to build a system that wants to make
 families stronger instead of pulling them apart," Pryce says.

I want you to imagine that you are a Child Protective Services worker. And you have to
respond to a report of child abuse. You walk into a home, unannounced, unexpected,
certainly uninvited. The first thing you see is a mattress in the middle of the room, on
the floor. Three kids lying on it, asleep. There's a small table nearby with a couple of
ashtrays, empty beer cans. Large rat traps are set in the corner, not too far from where
the kids lie asleep. So you make a note. A part of your job is walking through the entire
home. So you start with the kitchen, where there's very little food. You notice another
mattress in the bedroom, on the floor, that the mother shares with her infant child. Now,
generally, at this point, two things may happen. The children are deemed unsafe and
removed from the home, and placed in state custody for a specified period of time. Or the
children remain with their family and the child welfare system provides help and
support. When I was a Child Protective Services worker, I saw things like this all the
time.

Some far better, some far worse. I asked you to imagine yourself in that home, because I
wonder what crossed your mind. What guides your decisions? What's going to impact your
opinion of that family? What race, ethnicity, did you think the family was? I want you to
realize that if those children were white, it is more likely that their family stays
together after that visit. Research done at the University of Pennsylvania found that
white families, on average, have access to more help and more support from the child
welfare system. And their cases are less likely to go through a full investigation. But on
the other hand, if those kids are black, they are four times more likely to be removed,
they spend longer periods of time in foster care, and it's harder to find them a stable
foster placement. Foster care is meant to be an immediate shelter of protection for kids
who are at high risk. But it's also a confusing and traumatic exit from the
family.

Research done at the University of Minnesota found that kids who went through foster care
had more behavioral problems and internalized issues than kids who remain with their
families while receiving help and support. The scenario I mentioned earlier is not
uncommon. A single mother, living in low-income housing with her four children. And the
rats make it almost impossible to keep food, let alone fresh food in the home. Does that
mother deserve to have her children taken from her? Emma Ketteringham, a family court
attorney, says that if you live in a poor neighborhood, then you better be a perfect
parent. She says that we place unfair, often unreachable standards on parents who are
raising their kids with very little money. And their neighborhood and ethnicity impact
whether or not their kids are removed. In the two years I spent on the front lines of
child welfare, I made high-stakes decisions.

And I saw firsthand how my personal values impacted my work. Now, as social work faculty at
Florida State University, I lead an institute that curates the most innovative and
effective child welfare research. And research tells us that there are twice as many black
kids in foster care, twenty-eight percent, than there are in the general population, 14
percent. And although there are several reasons why, I want to discuss one reason today:
implicit bias. Let's start with "implicit." It's subconscious, something you're not aware
of. Bias â€” those stereotypes and attitudes that we all have about certain groups of
people. So, implicit bias is what lurks in the background of every decision that we make.
So how can we fix it? I have a promising solution that I want to share. Now, in almost
every state, there are high numbers of black kids going into foster care. But data
revealed that Nassau County, a community in New York, had managed to decrease the number
of black kids being removed.

And in 2016, I went into that community with my team and led a research study, discovering
the use of blind removal meetings. This is how it works. A case worker responds to a report
of child abuse. They go out to the home, but before the children are removed, the case
worker must come back to the office and present what they found. But here's the
distinction: When they present to the committee, they delete names, ethnicity,
neighborhood, race, all identifiable information. They focus on what happened, family
strength, relevant history and the parents' ability to protect the child. With that
information, the committee makes a recommendation, never knowing the race of the family.
Blind removals have made a drastic impact in that community. In 2011, 57 percent of the
kids going into foster care were black. But after five years of blind removals, that is
down to 21 percent.

Here's what we learned from talking to some of the case workers. "When a family has a
history with the department, many of us hold that history against them, even if they're
trying to do things differently." "When I see a case from a certain apartment building,
neighborhood or zip code, I just automatically think the worst." "Child welfare is very
subjective, because it's an emotional field. There's no one who doesn't have emotions
around this work. And it's very hard to leave all of your stuff at the door when you do
this work. So let's take the subjectivity of race and neighborhood out of it, and you
might get different outcomes."Blind removals seem to be bringing us closer to solving the
problem of implicit bias in foster-care decisions. My next step is figuring out how to use
artificial intelligence and machine learning to bring this project to scale and make it
more accessible to other states. I know we can transform child welfare.

We can hold organizations accountable to developing the social consciousness of their
employees. We can hold ourselves accountable to making sure our decisions are driven by
ethics and safety. Let's imagine a child welfare system that focuses on partnering with
parents, empowering families, and no longer see poverty as failure. Let's work together to
build a system that wants to make families stronger instead of pulling them apart. Thank
you.
