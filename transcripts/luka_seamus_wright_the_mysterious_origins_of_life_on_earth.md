Billions of years ago on the young planet Earth simple organic compounds assembled into
more complex coalitions that could grow and reproduce. They were the very first life on
Earth, and they gave rise to every one of the billions of species that have inhabited our
planet since. At the time, Earth was almost completely devoid of what we’d recognize as a
suitable environment for living things. The young planet had widespread volcanic
activity and an atmosphere that created hostile conditions. So where on Earth could life
begin? To begin the search for the cradle of life, it’s important to first understand the 
basic necessities for any life form. Elements and compounds essential to life include
hydrogen, methane, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, phosphates, and ammonia. In order for these
ingredients to comingle and react with each other, they need a liquid solvent: water. And
in order to grow and reproduce, all life needs a source of energy.

Life forms are divided into two camps: autotrophs, like plants, that generate their own
energy, and heterotrophs, like animals, that consume other organisms for energy. The
first life form wouldn’t have had other organisms to consume, of course, so it must have
been an autotroph, generating energy either from the sun or from chemical gradients. So
what locations meet these criteria? Places on land or close to the surface of the ocean
have the advantage of access to sunlight. But at the time when life began, the UV
radiation on Earth’s surface was likely too harsh for life to survive there. One setting
offers protection from this radiation and an alternative energy source: the hydrothermal
vents that wind across the ocean floor, covered by kilometers of seawater and bathed in
complete darkness. A hydrothermal vent is a fissure in the Earth’s crust where seawater
seeps into magma chambers and is ejected back out at high temperatures, along with a
rich slurry of minerals and simple chemical compounds.

Energy is particularly concentrated at the steep chemical gradients of hydrothermal
vents. There’s another line of evidence that points to hydrothermal vents: the Last
Universal Common Ancestor of life, or LUCA for short. LUCA wasn’t the first life form, 
but it’s as far back as we can trace. Even so, we don’t actually know what LUCA looked
like— there’s no LUCA fossil, no modern-day LUCA still around— instead, scientists
identified genes that are commonly found in species across all three domains of life that
exist today. Since these genes are shared across species and domains, they must have been
inherited from a common ancestor. These shared genes tell us that LUCA lived in a hot,
oxygen-free place and harvested energy from a chemical gradient— like the ones at
hydrothermal vents. There are two kinds of hydrothermal vent: black smokers and white
smokers. Black smokers release acidic, carbon-dioxide-rich water, heated to hundreds of
degrees Celsius and packed with sulphur, iron, copper, and other metals essential to
life.

But scientists now believe that black smokers were too hot for LUCA— so now the top
candidates for the cradle of life are white smokers. Among the white smokers, a field of
hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge called Lost City has become the most favored
candidate for the cradle of life. The seawater expelled here is highly alkaline and
lacks carbon dioxide, but is rich in methane and offers more hospitable temperatures.
Adjacent black smokers may have contributed the carbon dioxide necessary for life to
evolve at Lost City, giving it all the components to support the first organisms that
radiated into the incredible diversity of life on Earth today.
