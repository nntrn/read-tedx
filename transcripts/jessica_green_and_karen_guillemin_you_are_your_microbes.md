title: You are your microbes
speaker: Jessica Green and Karen Guillemin
description: >-
 From the microbes in our stomachs to the ones on our teeth we are homes to
 millions of unique and diverse communities which help our bodies function.
 Jessica Green and Karen Guillemin emphasize the importance of understanding the
 many organisms that make up each and every organism. [Directed by Celine Keller
 and Paula Spagnoletti, narrated by Jessica Green].

Being human, we each view ourselves as a unique and independent individual, but we're
never alone! Millions of microscopic beings inhabit our bodies, and no two bodies are the
same. Each is a different habitat for microbial communities: from the arid deserts of our
skin, to the villages on our lips, and the cities in our mouths. Even every tooth is its
own distinctive neighborhood, and our guts are teaming metropolises of interacting
microbes. And in these bustling streets of our guts, we see a constant influx of food, and
every microbe has a job to do. Here's a cellulolytic bacteria, for example. Their one job
is to break down cellulose, a common compound in vegetables, into sugars. Those simple
sugars then move along to the respirators, another set of microbes that snatch up these
simple sugars and burn them as fuel. As food travels through our digestive tract, it
reaches the fermentors who extract energy from these sugars by converting them into
chemicals, like alcohol and hydrogen gas, which they spew out as waste
products.

Deeper in the depths of our gut city, the syntrophs eke out a living off the fermenters'
trash. At each step of this process, energy is released, and that energy is absorbed by
the cells of the digestive tract. This city we just saw is different in everyone. Every
person has a unique and diverse community of gut microbes that can process food in
different ways. One person's gut microbes may be capable of releasing only a fraction of
the calories that another person's gut microbes can extract. So, what determines the
membership of our gut microbial community? Well, things like our genetic makeup and the
microbes we encounter throughout our lives can contribute to our microbial ecosystems. The
food we eat also influences which microbes live in our gut. For example, food made of
complex molecules, like an apple, requires a lot of different microbial workers to break
it down. But, if a food is made of simple molecules, like a lollipop, some of these
workers are put out of a job.

Those workers leave the city, never to return. What doesn't function well are gut
microbial communities with only a few different types of workers. For example, humans who
suffer from diseases like diabetes or chronic gut inflamation typically have less
microbial variety in their guts. We don't fully understand the best way to manage our
individual microbial societies, but it is likely that lifestyle changes, such as eating a
varied diet of complex, plant-based foods, can help revitalize our microbial ecosystems in
our gut and across the entire landscape of our body. So, we are really not alone in our
body. Our bodies are homes to millions of different microbes, and we need them just as
much as they need us. As we learn more about how our microbes interact with each other and
with our bodies, we will reveal how we can nurture this complex, invisible world that
shapes our personal identity, our health, and our well-being.
