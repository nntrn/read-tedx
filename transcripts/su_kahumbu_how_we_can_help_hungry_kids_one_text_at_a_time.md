title: How we can help hungry kids, one text at a time
speaker: Su Kahumbu
description: >-
 Su Kahumbu raises badass cows -- healthy, well-fed animals whose protein is key
 to solving a growing crisis in Africa: childhood nutritional stunting. With iCow,
 a simple SMS service she developed to support small-scale livestock farmers, the
 TED Fellow is helping farmers across the continent by texting them tips on caring
 for and raising animals. Learn more about how this cheap innovation is helping
 feed hungry kids, one text at a time.

I want to introduce you to my badass friends. Meet Thelma and Louise.

I'm passionate about cows. And although they've been getting a lot of crap lately due to
methane emissions and climate change, I hope that I can redeem their reputation in part by
showing you how incredibly important they are in solving one of the world's biggest
problems: food security. But more importantly, for Africa — it's resultant childhood
stunting. Nutritional stunting manifests itself in a reduction of growth rate in human
development. And according to UNICEF, stunting doesn't come easy. It doesn't come quickly.
It happens over a long period of time during which a child endures painful and
debilitating cycles of illness, depressed appetite, insufficient nutrition and inadequate
care. And most kids simply can't endure such rigors. But those that do survive, they carry
forward long-term cognitive problems as well as losses of stature. The numbers of stunted
children under the age of five, in most regions of the world, has been
declining.

And I really hate to say this, but the only place where they haven't been declining is
here, in Africa. Here, 59 million children, three in 10 in that age group, struggle to
meet their genetic potential — their full genetic potential. Protein is one of our most
important dietary requirements, and evidence shows that lack of essential amino acids, the
building blocks of proteins, in young children's diets, can result in stunting. Essential
amino acids are called essential because we can't synthesize them in our bodies. We have
to get them from our foods and the best sources are animal-derived: milk, meat and eggs.
Most protein consumed on the African continent is crop-based. And although we have
millions of smallholder farmers rearing animals, livestock production is not as easy as we
think. The big livestock gaps between rich countries and poor countries are due to poor
animal health. Endemic livestock diseases, some of them transmissible to humans, threaten
not only livestock producers in those poor countries, but all human health across all
countries. This is a global pathogens network.

It shows the pathogens found across the world according to the Enhanced Infectious
Diseases database. And it shows those pathogens that share hosts. In a nutshell, we share
pathogens, and thus diseases, with the species we live closest to: our livestock. And we
call these zoonotic diseases. Recent reports show that the deadly dozen zoonotic diseases
kill 2.2 million people and sicken 2.4 billion people annually. And Jimmy says, "The
greatest burden of zoonoses falls on one billion poor livestock keepers."We totally
underestimate the importance of our smallholder farmers. We're beginning to recognize how
important they are and how they influence our medical health, our biosafety and more
recently, our cognitive and our physical health. They stand at the frontline of zoonotic
epidemics. They pretty much underpin our existence. And they need to know so much, yet
most lack knowledge on livestock disease prevention and treatment. So how do they
learn?

Apart from shared experiences, trial and error, conventional farming extension services
are boots on the ground and radio — expensive and hard to scale in the face of population
growth. Sounds pretty gloomy, doesn't it? But we're at an interesting point in Africa.
We're changing that narrative using innovative solutions, riding across scalable
technologies. Knowledge doesn't have to be expensive. My company developed an agricultural
platform called iCow. We teach farmers best livestock practices using SMS over simple,
low-end phones. Farmers receive three SMSs a week on best livestock practices, and those
that execute the messages go on to see increases in productivity within as short a time as
three months. The first increases in productivity, of course, are improved animal health.
We use SMS because it is retentive. Farmers store their messages, they write them down in
books, and in effect, we're drip-feeding agricultural manuals into the fields. We recognize
that we are all part of the global food network: producers and consumers, you and me, and
every farmer.

We're focusing now on trying to bring together producers and consumers to take action and
take responsibility for not only food security, but for food safety. This beautiful animal
is an African-Asian Sahiwal crossed with a Dutch Fleckvieh. She's milkier than her Sahiwal
mom, and she's sturdier and more resistant to disease than her Fleckvieh father. In
Ethiopia and Tanzania, the African Dairy Genetic Gains program is using SMS and
cutting-edge genomics and pioneering Africa's first tropically adapted dairy breeding
centers and dairy performance recording centers. Farmers contribute their production data
— milking records, breeding records and feeding records — to the ADGG platform. This stage
is synthesized through algorithms from some of the top livestock institutions in the world
before it lands back in the farmers' hands in actionable SMSs. Customized data, customized
responses all aimed at increasing productivity based on the potential on the ground. We're
at a very interesting place in agriculture in Africa.

By the end of this year, we'll have almost one billion mobile phone subscriptions. We have
the power in our hands to ensure that livestock production systems are not only healthy,
productive and profitable, but that farmers are knowledgeable, and more importantly, that
our farmers are safe. Working with smallholder farmers is one of the best ways to guarantee
food security. Working with smallholder farmers is one of the best ways to guarantee each
and every child their full opportunity and ability to reach their full genetic potential.
And harnessing the power of millions of smallholder farmers and their badass cows like
mine, we should be able to bring a halt to stunting in Africa. Thank you.

Thank you.
