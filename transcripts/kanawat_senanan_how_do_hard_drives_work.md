Imagine an airplane flying one millimeter above the ground and circling the Earth once
every 25 seconds while counting every blade of grass. Shrink all that down so that it fits
in the palm of your hand, and you'd have something equivalent to a modern hard drive, an
object that can likely hold more information than your local library. So how does it store
so much information in such a small space? At the heart of every hard drive is a stack of
high-speed spinning discs with a recording head flying over each surface. Each disc is
coated with a film of microscopic magnetised metal grains, and your data doesn't live
there in a form you can recognize. Instead, it is recorded as a magnetic pattern formed
by groups of those tiny grains. In each group, also known as a bit, all of the grains have
 their magnetization's aligned in one of two possible states, which correspond to zeroes
and ones. Data is written onto the disc by converting strings of bits into electrical
current fed through an electromagnet.

This magnet generates a field strong enough to change the direction of the metal grain's
magnetization. Once this information is written onto the disc, the drive uses a magnetic
reader to turn it back into a useful form, much like a phonograph needle translates a
record's grooves into music. But how can you get so much information out of just zeroes
and ones? Well, by putting lots of them together. For example, a letter is represented in
one byte, or eight bits, and your average photo takes up several megabytes, each of which
is 8 million bits. Because each bit must be written onto a physical area of the disc,
we're always seeking to increase the disc's areal density, or how many bits can be
squeezed into one square inch. The areal density of a modern hard drive is about 600
gigabits per square inch, 300 million times greater than that of IBM's first hard drive
from 1957. This amazing advance in storage capacity wasn't just a matter of making
everything smaller, but involved multiple innovations.

A technique called the thin film lithography process allowed engineers to shrink the
reader and writer. And despite its size, the reader became more sensitive by taking
advantage of new discoveries in magnetic and quantum properties of matter. Bits could also
be packed closer together thanks to mathematical algorithms that filter out noise from
magnetic interference, and find the most likely bit sequences from each chunk of read-back
signal. And thermal expansion control of the head, enabled by placing a heater under the
magnetic writer, allowed it to fly less than five nanometers above the disc's surface,
about the width of two strands of DNA. For the past several decades, the exponential
growth in computer storage capacity and processing power has followed a pattern known as
Moore's Law, which, in 1975, predicted that information density would double every two
years. But at around 100 gigabits per square inch, shrinking the magnetic grains further
or cramming them closer together posed a new risk called the superparamagnetic
effect.

When a magnetic grain volume is too small, its magnetization is easily disturbed by heat
energy and can cause bits to switch unintentionally, leading to data loss. Scientists
resolved this limitation in a remarkably simple way: by changing the direction of
recording from longitudinal to perpendicular, allowing areal density to approach one
terabit per square inch. Recently, the potential limit has been increased yet again
through heat assisted magnetic recording. This uses an even more thermally stable
recording medium, whose magnetic resistance is momentarily reduced by heating up a
particular spot with a laser and allowing data to be written. And while those drives are
currently in the prototype stage, scientists already have the next potential trick up
their sleeves: bit-patterned media, where bit locations are arranged in separate,
nano-sized structures, potentially allowing for areal densities of twenty terabits per
square inch or more.

So it's thanks to the combined efforts of generations of engineers, material scientists,
and quantum physicists that this tool of incredible power and precision can spin in the
palm of your hand.
