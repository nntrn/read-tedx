title: The stories behind The New Yorker's iconic covers
speaker: Françoise Mouly
description: >-
 Meet Françoise Mouly, The New Yorker's art director. For the past 24 years, she's
 helped decide what appears on the magazine's famous cover, from the black-on-black
 depiction of the Twin Towers the week after 9/11 to a recent, Russia-influenced
 riff on the magazine's mascot, Eustace Tilley. In this visual retrospective,
 Mouly considers how a simple drawing can cut through the torrent of images that
 we see every day and elegantly capture the feeling (and the sensibility) of a
 moment in time.

So 24 years ago, I was brought to The New Yorker as art editor to rejuvenate what had by
then become a somewhat staid institution and to bring in new artists and to try to bring
the magazine from its ivory tower into engaging with its time. And it was just the right
thing for me to do because I've always been captivated by how an image can — a simple
drawing — can cut through the torrent of images that we see every single day. How it can
capture a moment, how it can crystallize a social trend or a complex event in a way that a
lot of words wouldn't be able to do — and reduce it to its essence and turn it into a
cartoon. So I went to the library and I looked at the first cover drawn by Rea Irvin in
1925 — a dandy looking at a butterfly through his monocle, and we call it Eustace Tilley.
And I realized that as the magazine had become known for its in-depth research and long
reports, some of the humor had gotten lost along the way, because now often Eustace Tilley
was seen as a haughty dandy, but in fact, in 1925, when Rea Irvin first drew this image,
he did it as part of a humor magazine to amuse the youth of the era, which was the
flappers of the roaring twenties.

And in the library, I found the images that really captured the zeitgeist of the Great
Depression. And it showed us not just how people dressed or what their cars looked like,
but also what made them laugh, what their prejudices were. And you really got a sense of
what it felt like to be alive in the '30s. So I called on contemporary artists, such as
Adrian Tomine here. I often call on narrative artists — cartoonists, children's book
authors — and I give them themes such as, you know, what it's like to be in the subway, or
Valentine's Day, and they send me sketches. And once the sketches are approved by the
editor, David Remnick, it's a go. And I love the way those images are actually not telling
you what to think. But they do make you think, because the artist is actually — it's
almost a puzzle; the artist is drawing the dots, and you, the reader, have to complete the
picture. So to get this image on the left by Anita Kunz, or the one on right by Tomer
Hanuka, you have to play spot the differences.

And it is something that ... It's really exciting to see how the engagement with the
reader ... how those images really capture — play with the stereotypes. But when you get
it, it rearranges the stereotypes that are in your head. But the images don't just have to
show people, sometimes it can be a feeling. Right after September 11, I was at a point,
like everybody else, where I really didn't know how to deal with what we were going
through, and I felt that no image could capture this moment, and I wanted to just do a
black cover, like no cover. And I talked to my husband, cartoonist Art Spiegelman, and
mentioned to him that I was going to propose that, and he said, "Oh, if you're going to do
a black cover, then why don't you do the silhouette of the Twin Towers, black on black?"
And I sat down to draw this, and as soon as I saw it, a shiver ran down my spine and I
realized that in this refusal to make an image, we had found a way to capture loss and
mourning and absence.

And it's been a profound thing that I learned in the process — that sometimes some of the
images that say the most do it with the most spare means. And a simple image can speak
volumes. So this is the image that we published by Bob Staake right after the election of
Barack Obama, and captured a historic moment. But we can't really plan for this, because
in order to do this, we have to let the artist experience the emotions that we all feel
when that is happening. So back in November 2016, during the election last year, the only
image that we could publish was this, which was on the stand on the week that everybody
voted.

Because we knew somebody would feel this —

when the result of the election was announced. And when we found out the result, we really
were at a loss, and this is the image that was sent by Bob Staake again, and that really
hit a chord. And again, we can't really figure out what's going to come next, but here it
felt like we didn't know how to move forward, but we did move forward, and this is the
image that we published after Donald Trump's election and at the time of the Women's March
all over the US.So over those 24 years, I have seen over 1,000 images come to life week
after week, and I'm often asked which one is my favorite, but I can't pick one because
what I'm most proud of is how different every image is, one from the other. And that's due
to the talent and the diversity of all of the artists that contribute. And now, well, now,
we're owned by Russia, so —

In a rendering by Barry Blitt here, Eustace has become Eustace Vladimirovich Tilley. And
the butterfly is none other than a flabbergasted Donald Trump flapping his wings, trying
to figure out how to control the butterfly effect, and the famed logo that was drawn by
Rae Irvin in 1925 is now in Cyrillic. So, what makes me really excited about this moment is
the way that ... You know, free press is essential to our democracy. And we can see from
the sublime to the ridiculous that artists can capture what is going on in a way that an
artist armed with just India ink and watercolor can capture and enter into the cultural
dialogue. It puts those artists at the center of that culture, and that's exactly where I
think they should be. Because the main thing we need right now is a good cartoon. Thank
you.
