 In 1958, after receiving a letter describing the deaths of songbirds due to the
 pesticide known as DDT, Rachel Carson began an investigation into the misuse of
 chemicals and their toll on nature. In 1962, she published her findings in
 "Silent Spring," which immediately drew both applause and impassioned dissent.
 How did this biologist and writer ignite such controversy? Mark Lytle investigates.

In 1958, Rachel Carson received a letter describing songbirds suddenly dropping from tree
branches. The writer blamed their deaths on a pesticide called DDT that exterminators had
sprayed on a nearby marsh. The letter was the push Carson needed to investigate DDT. She
had already heard from scientists and conservationists who were worried that rampant use
of the pesticide posed a threat to fish, birds, and possibly humans. She began to make
inquiries through government contacts from her years working in the United States Bureau
of Fisheries. She asked: “what has already silenced the voices of spring?”In 1962, Carson
published her findings in "Silent Spring." Her book documented the misuse of chemicals
and their toll on nature and human health. "Silent Spring" immediately drew both 
applause and impassioned dissent— along with vicious personal attacks on the author. How
did this mild-mannered biologist and writer ignite such controversy? Carson began her
career as a hardworking graduate student, balancing her studies in biology at John
Hopkins University with part time jobs.

Still, she had to leave school before completing her doctorate to provide for her ailing
father and sister. Carson found part time work with the Bureau of Fisheries writing for
a radio program on marine biology. Her ability to write materials that could hold the
general public’s attention impressed her superiors, and in 1936, she became the second
woman to be hired at the Bureau full time. In 1941, she published the first of three
books on the ocean, combining science with lyrical meditations on underwater worlds. These
explorations resonated with a wide audience. In "Silent Spring," Carson turned her
attention to the ways human actions threaten the balance of nature. DDT was originally
used during World War II to shield crops from insects and protect soldiers from
insect-borne diseases. After the war, it was routinely sprayed in wide swaths to fight
pests, often with unforeseen results. One attempt to eradicate fire ants in the southern
U.S.

killed wildlife indiscriminately, but did little to eliminate the ants. In spite of this
and other mishaps, the US Department of Agriculture and chemical companies extolled the
benefits of DDT. There was little regulation or public awareness about its potential
harm. But Carson showed how the overuse of chemicals led to the evolution of resistant
species— which, in turn, encouraged the development of deadlier chemicals. Since DDT does
not dissolve in water, she asserted that over time it would accumulate in the
environment, the bodies of insects, the tissues of animals who consume those insects, and
eventually humans. She suggested that exposure to DDT might alter the structure of genes,
with unknown consequences for future generations. The response to "Silent Spring" was
explosive. For many people the book was a call to regulate substances capable of
catastrophic harm. Others objected that Carson hadn’t mentioned DDT’s role controlling
the threat insects posed to human health.

Former Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson demanded to know “why a spinster with no
children was so concerned about genetics?” and dismissed Carson as “probably a
Communist.” A lawyer for a pesticide manufacturer alluded to Carson and her supporters as
“sinister influences” aiming to paint businesses as “immoral.”In reality, Carson had
focused on the dangers of chemicals because they weren’t widely understood, while the
merits were well publicized. She rejected the prevailing belief that humans should and
could control nature. Instead, she challenged people to cultivate “maturity and mastery,
not of nature, but of ourselves.”Carson died of cancer in 1964, only two years after the
publication of "Silent Spring." Her work galvanized a generation of environmental
activists. In 1969, under pressure from environmentalists, Congress passed the National
Environmental Policy Act that required federal agencies to evaluate environmental impacts
of their actions.

To enforce the act, President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency.
And in 1972, the EPA issued a partial ban on the use of DDT. Long after her death, Rachel
Carson continued to advocate for nature through the lingering impact of her
writing.
