title: Why are some people left-handed?
speaker: Daniel M. Abrams
description: >-
 Today, about one-tenth of the world's population are southpaws. Why are such a
 small proportion of people left-handed -- and why does the trait exist in the
 first place? Daniel M. Abrams investigates how the uneven ratio of lefties and
 righties gives insight into a balance between competitive and cooperative
 pressures on human evolution. [Directed by TED-Ed, narrated by Addison Anderson,
 music by Michael Dow].

If you know an older left-handed person, chances are they had to learn to write or eat
with their right hand. And in many parts of the world, it's still common practice to force
children to use their "proper" hand. Even the word for right also means correct or good,
not just in English, but many other languages, too. But if being left-handed is so wrong,
then why does it happen in the first place? Today, about 1/10 of the world's population
are left-handed. Archeological evidence shows that it's been that way for as long as
500,000 years, with about 10% of human remains showing the associated differences in arm
length and bone density, and some ancient tools and artifacts showing evidence of
left-hand use. And despite what many may think, handedness is not a choice. It can be
predicted even before birth based on the fetus' position in the womb. So, if handedness is
inborn, does that mean it's genetic? Well, yes and no.

Identical twins, who have the same genes, can have different dominant hands. In fact, this
happens as often as it does with any other sibling pair. But the chances of being right or
left-handed are determined by the handedness of your parents in surprisingly consistent
ratios. If your father was left-handed but your mother was right-handed, you have a 17%
chance of being born left-handed, while two righties will have a left-handed child only
10% of the time. Handedness seems to be determined by a roll of the dice, but the odds are
set by your genes. All of this implies there's a reason that evolution has produced this
small proportion of lefties, and maintained it over the course of millennia. And while
there have been several theories attempting to explain why handedness exists in the first
place, or why most people are right-handed, a recent mathematical model suggests that the
actual ratio reflects a balance between competitive and cooperative pressures on human
evolution.

The benefits of being left-handed are clearest in activities involving an opponent, like
combat or competitive sports. For example, about 50% of top hitters in baseball have been
left-handed. Why? Think of it as a surprise advantage. Because lefties are a minority to
begin with, both right-handed and left-handed competitors will spend most of their time
encountering and practicing against righties. So when the two face each other, the
left-hander will be better prepared against this right-handed opponent, while the righty
will be thrown off. This fighting hypothesis, where an imbalance in the population results
in an advantage for left-handed fighters or athletes, is an example of negative
frequency-dependent selection. But according to the principles of evolution, groups that
have a relative advantage tend to grow until that advantage disappears. If people were
only fighting and competing throughout human evolution, natural selection would lead to
more lefties being the ones that made it until there were so many of them, that it was no
longer a rare asset.

So in a purely competitive world, 50% of the population would be left-handed. But human
evolution has been shaped by cooperation, as well as competition. And cooperative pressure
pushes handedness distribution in the opposite direction. In golf, where performance
doesn't depend on the opponent, only 4% of top players are left-handed, an example of the
wider phenomenon of tool sharing. Just as young potential golfers can more easily find a
set of right-handed clubs, many of the important instruments that have shaped society were
designed for the right-handed majority. Because lefties are worse at using these tools,
and suffer from higher accident rates, they would be less successful in a purely
cooperative world, eventually disappearing from the population. So by correctly predicting
the distribution of left-handed people in the general population, as well as matching data
from various sports, the model indicates that the persistence of lefties as a small but
stable minority reflects an equilibrium that comes from competitive and cooperative
effects playing out simultaneously over time.

And the most intriguing thing is what the numbers can tell us about various populations.
From the skewed distribution of pawedness in cooperative animals, to the slightly larger
percentage of lefties in competitive hunter-gatherer societies, we may even find that the
answers to some puzzles of early human evolution are already in our hands.
