title: The Arctic vs. the Antarctic
speaker: Camille Seaman
description: >-
 How can you tell the two poles apart? Where are the penguins? What about the
 bears? The Arctic pole is located in the Northern Hemisphere within the deep
 Arctic Ocean, while the Antarctic pole is smack in the middle of the ice-covered
 Antarctica. Camille Seaman describes how enterprising people and organisms have
 found ways to reside around both poles despite the frigid temperatures. [Directed
 by Iuri Araújo & Guilherme Araújo, narrated by Michelle Snow].

On our planet, we have two polar regions: the Arctic, whose name comes from the Greek
Arktikos, of the North, and the Antarctic from Antarktikos, opposite of the North. But
there's an easier way to remember them if you just remember what surrounds them. The
Arctic, situated in the Northern hemisphere of our planet, is an ocean entirely surrounded
by land. On the other side of the world, the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded
by ocean. So, the Arctic has polar bears but no penguins, and the Antarctic has penguins
but no polar bears. Let's talk about the Arctic first. The Arctic region consists of a
vast, ice-covered ocean surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as the
region between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole. If you were to stand at the North
Pole, everywhere you looked, in all directions, would be south. But standing at the North
Pole is difficult to do for very long because it's in the middle of an ocean, covered by
constantly shifting, frozen sea ice.

If you were to fall into the water at the North Pole, you'd fall into water that's 13,980
feet deep. Above the water, average winter temperatures can be as low as -40 degrees
Celsius, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately -68 degrees Celsius.
Despite these incredibly harsh conditions, humans have populated areas in the Arctic for
thousands of years. Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice, zooplankton
and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants, and human
societies. Okay, what about Antarctica? Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent, and
it contains the geographic South Pole. It's the fifth largest continent on the planet at
nearly twice the size of Australia. Almost 98% of Anarctica is covered by ice at least one
mile in thickness. Conditions in Antarctica are some of the most extreme in the entire
world. On average, it's the coldest, windiest, driest continent and has the highest
average elevation of all the continents.

You might think that it snows all the time at the Poles, but Antarctica is so dry, it's
considered a desert with annual precipitation of only 200 millimeters along the coast and
far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached -89 degrees Celsius. Because
it's so harsh and hard to get to, there are no permanent human residents on Antarctica,
but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research
stations scattered across the continent. Even the most extreme animals fight for survival,
and only cold-adapted organisms survive there, including many types of algae, animals,
bacteria, fungi, plants, and protista. But why is Antarctica colder than its northern
cousin? Well, first, much of the continent is more than three kilometers above sea level,
and temperature decreases with elevation. That's why mountaintops have snow on them.
Second, remember that the Arctic is really a frozen ocean.

The water in the ocean beneath it is warmer than the frozen ground in the Antarctic, and
that warmth is transferred through the ice pack. This prevents temperatures in the Arctic
regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the
seasons are conspiring against the Antarctic. During the aphelion in July, when the Earth
is the farthest away from the Sun, it also happens to be winter in the Antarctic, which
creates a double-whammy of cold for the southern pole. But despite being inhospitable, the
North and South Pole are a big reason why our planet is the way it is. Both of our polar
regions are very important climate controllers. They help moderate the temperature in our
temperate zones and give us stable weather. As sea ice in the Arctic declines due to
climate change and global warming, weather around the globe becomes increasing more
unstable.
