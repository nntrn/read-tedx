I’d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo, who was put to sleep a couple of days ago,
because he got too old. But apparently he was a very nice dog and he always let the cat
sleep in the dog bed.♫ (Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh,
heh. ♫♫ I'm just a'walking my dog, singing my song, strolling along. ♫♫ Yeah, it's just me
and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong. ♫♫ My life was lonely and blue. ♫♫ Yeah,
I was sad as a sailor, ♫♫ I was an angry 'un too. ♫♫ Then there was you — appeared when I
was entangled with youth and fear, ♫♫ and nerves jingle jangled, vermouth and beer were
getting me mangled up. ♫♫ But then I looked in your eyes ♫♫ and I was no more a failure.
♫♫ You looked so wacky and wise. ♫♫ And I said, "Lord, I'm happy, 'cause I'm just
a'walking my dog, ♫♫ catching some sun. We can't go wrong." ♫♫ Yeah, it's just me and my
dog, singing our song, strolling along.

♫♫ 'Cause I don't care about your hating and your doubt, ♫♫ and I don't care what the
politicians spout. ♫♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫♫ and find
yourself a hound, and make that doggie proud, ♫♫ 'cause that's what it's all about. ♫♫
(Dog panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫♫ My life was
tragic and sad. ♫♫ I was the archetypal loser. ♫♫ I was a pageant gone bad. ♫♫ And then
there was you — on time, and wagging your tail ♫♫ in the cutest mime that you was in jail.
♫♫ I said, "Woof, be mine!" and you gave a wail and then ♫♫ I was no longer alone. ♫♫ And
I was no more a boozer. ♫♫ We'll make the happiest home. ♫♫ And I said, "Lord, I'm happy,
'cause I’m just a'walking my dog, ♫♫ singing my song, strolling along." ♫♫ Yeah, it's just
me and my dog, catching some sun. We can't go wrong, ♫♫ 'cause I don't care about your
hating and your doubt, ♫♫ and I don’t care what the politicians spout.

♫♫ If you need a companion, why, just go out to the pound, ♫♫ and find yourself a hound,
and make that doggie proud, ♫♫ 'cause that's what it's all about, ♫♫ that's what it's all
about, ♫♫ that's what it's all abou-BOW-WOW-WOW-WOW ♫♫ that's what it's all about. ♫♫ (Dog
panting noise) Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. ♫Good dog!Thank you.
