I'm Clint Smith and this is "Ode to the Only Black Kid in the Class." You, it seems, 
are the manifestation of several lifetimes of toil. Brown v. Board in flesh. Most days
the classroom feels like an antechamber. You are deemed expert on all things Morrison, 
King, Malcolm, Rosa. Hell, weren’t you sitting on that bus, too? You are every-
body’s best friend until you are not. Hip-hop lyricologist. Presumed athlete. Free &
Reduced sideshow. Exception and caricature. Too black and too white all at once. If you
are successful it is because of affirmative action. If you fail it is because you were
destined to. You are invisible until they turn on the Friday night lights. Here you are
star before they render you asteroid. Before they watch you turn to dust.
