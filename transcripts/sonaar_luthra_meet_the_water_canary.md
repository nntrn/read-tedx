title: Meet the Water Canary
speaker: Sonaar Luthra
description: >-
 After a crisis, how can we tell if water is safe to drink? Current tests are slow
 and complex, and the delay can be deadly, as in the cholera outbreak after
 Haiti's earthquake in 2010. TED Fellow Sonaar Luthra previews his design for a
 simple tool that quickly tests water for safety -- the Water Canary.

Cholera was reported in Haiti for the first time in over 50 years last October. There was
no way to predict how far it would spread through water supplies and how bad the situation
would get. And not knowing where help was needed always ensured that help was in short
supply in the areas that needed it most. We've gotten good at predicting and preparing for
storms before they take innocent lives and cause irreversible damage, but we still can't
do that with water, and here's why. Right now, if you want to test water in the field, you
need a trained technician, expensive equipment like this, and you have to wait about a day
for chemical reactions to take place and provide results. It's too slow to get a picture
of conditions on the ground before they change, too expensive to implement in all the
places that require testing. And it ignores the fact that, in the meanwhile, people still
need to drink water.

Most of the information that we collected on the cholera outbreak didn't come from testing
water; it came from forms like this, which documented all the people we failed to
help. Countless lives have been saved by canaries in coalmines — a simple and invaluable
way for miners to know whether they're safe. I've been inspired by that simplicity as I've
been working on this problem with some of the most hardworking and brilliant people I've
ever known. We think there's a simpler solution to this problem — one that can be used by
people who face conditions like this everyday. It's in its early stages, but this is what
it looks like right now. We call it the Water Canary. It's a fast, cheap device that
answers an important question: Is this water contaminated? It doesn't require any special
training. And instead of waiting for chemical reactions to take place, it uses light. That
means there's no waiting for chemical reactions to take place, no need to use reagents
that can run out and no need to be an expert to get actionable information. To test water,
you simply insert a sample and, within seconds, it either displays a red light, indicating
contaminated water, or a green light, indicating the sample is safe.

This will make it possible for anyone to collect life-saving information and to monitor
water quality conditions as they unfold. We're also, on top of that, integrating wireless
networking into an affordable device with GPS and GSM. What that means is that each
reading can be automatically transmitted to servers to be mapped in real time. With enough
users, maps like this will make it possible to take preventive action, containing hazards
before they turn into emergencies that take years to recover from. And then, instead of
taking days to disseminate this information to the people who need it most, it can happen
automatically. We've seen how distributed networks, big data and information can transform
society. I think it's time for us to apply them to water. Our goal over the next year is to
get Water Canary ready for the field and to open-source the hardware so that anyone can
contribute to the development and the evaluation, so we can tackle this problem
together. Thank you.
