title: A moving song from women in prison for life
speaker: The Lady Lifers
description: >-
 The ten women in this chorus have all been sentenced to life in prison. They
 share a moving song about their experiences — one that reveals their hopes,
 regrets and fears. "I'm not an angel," sings one, "but I'm not the devil." Filmed
 at an independent TEDx event inside Muncy State Prison, it's a rare and poignant
 look inside the world of people imprisoned with no hope of parole. (Note: The
 prison's Office of Victim Advocacy has ensured that victims were treated fairly
 and respectfully around this TEDx event.)

Dannielle Hadley: Life in Pennsylvania means just that: life without the possibility of
parole. For us lifers, as we call ourselves, our only chance for release is through
commutation, which has only been granted to two women since 1989, close to 30 years ago.
Our song, "This Is Not Our Home," it tells of our experiences while doing life without the
possibility of parole.

Brenda Watkins: I'm a woman. I'm a grandmother. I'm a daughter. I have a son. I'm not an
angel. I'm not the devil. I came to jailwhen I was so young. I spend my time hereinside these
prison walls. Lost friends to death,saw some go home. Watch years pass,people come and
go,while I do life without parole. I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done. I'm doing time
here. This is not my home. Dream of freedom, hope for mercy. Will I seemy familyor die
alone? As the years go by,I hold back my tears,because if I cry I'd give in to fear. I must
be strong, have to hold on. Gotta get throughanother year. I am a prisoner for the wrong
I've done. I'm doing time here. This is not my home. Dream of freedom, hope for mercy. Will I
seemy familyor die alone? I'm not saying that I'm not guilty,I'm not saying that I
shouldn't pay. All I'm asking is for forgiveness. Gotta have hope I'll be free someday. Is
there a place for mein the world out there? Will they ever know or care that I'm chained? Is
there redemption for the sin of my younger days? Because I've changed. Lord knows I've
changed. I am a prisoner for the wrong I've done. I'm doing time here.
