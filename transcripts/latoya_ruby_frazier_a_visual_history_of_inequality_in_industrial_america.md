title: A visual history of inequality in industrial America
speaker: LaToya Ruby Frazier
description: >-
 For the last 12 years, LaToya Ruby Frazier has photographed friends, neighbors
 and family in Braddock, Pennsylvania. But though the steel town has lately been
 hailed as a posterchild of "rustbelt revitalization," Frazier's pictures tell a
 different story, of the real impact of inequality and environmental toxicity. In
 this short, powerful talk, the TED Fellow shares a deeply personal glimpse of an
 often-unseen world.

Along the ancient path of the Monongahela River, Braddock, Pennsylvania sits in the
eastern region of Allegheny County, approximately nine miles outside of Pittsburgh. An
industrial suburb, Braddock is home to Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill, the Edgar
Thomson Works. Operating since 1875, it is the last functioning steel mill in the region.
For 12 years, I have produced collaborative portraits, still lifes, landscapes and aerial
views in order to build a visual archive to address the intersection of the steel
industry, the environment, and the health care system's impact on the bodies of my family
and community. The tradition and grand narrative of Braddock is mostly comprised of stories
of industrialists and trade unions. Currently, the new narrative about Braddock, a poster
child for Rust Belt revitalization, is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new
frontier. Mass media has omitted the fact that Braddock is predominantly
black.

Our existence has been co-opted, silenced and erased. Fourth generation in a lineage of
women, I was raised under the protection and care of Grandma Ruby, off 8th Street at 805
Washington Avenue. She worked as a manager for Goodwill. Mom was a nurse's aid. She
watched the steel mills close and white flight to suburban developments. By the time my
generation walked the streets, disinvestment at the local, state and federal level, eroded
infrastructure, and the War on Drugs dismantled my family and community. Grandma Ruby's
stepfather Gramps was one of few black men to retire from Carnegie's mill with his
pension. He worked in high temperatures, tearing down and rebuilding furnaces, cleaning up
spilt metal and slag. The history of a place is written on the body and the landscape.
Areas of heavy truck traffic, exposure to benzene and atomized metals, risk cancer and
lupus. One hundred twenty-three licensed beds, 652 employees, rehabilitation programs
decimated.

A housing discrimination lawsuit against Allegheny County removed where the projects
Talbot Towers once stood. Recent rezoning for more light industry has since appeared.
Google Maps and Google Earth pixelations conceal the flammable waste being used to squeeze
the Bunn family off their home and land. In 2013, I chartered a helicopter with my cameras
to document this aggressive dispossession. In flight, my observation reveals thousands of
plastic white bundles owned by a conservation industry that claims it's eco-friendly and
recycles millions of tires to preserve people's lives and to improve people's lives. My
work spirals from the micro to the macro level, excavating hidden histories. Recently, at
the Seattle Art Museum, Isaac Bunn and I mounted this exhibition, and the exhibition was
used as a platform to launch his voice. Through reclamation of our narrative, we will
continue to fight historic erasure and socioeconomic inequality. Thank you.
