 Why do we dance? African-American social dances started as a way for enslaved
 Africans to keep cultural traditions alive and retain a sense of inner freedom.
 They remain an affirmation of identity and independence. In this electric

This is the Bop. The Bop is a type of social dance. Dance is a language, and social dance is
an expression that emerges from a community. A social dance isn't choreographed by any one
person. It can't be traced to any one moment. Each dance has steps that everyone can agree
on, but it's about the individual and their creative identity. Because of that, social
dances bubble up, they change and they spread like wildfire. They are as old as our
remembered history. In African-American social dances, we see over 200 years of how
African and African-American traditions influenced our history. The present always
contains the past. And the past shapes who we are and who we will be.

The Juba dance was born from enslaved Africans' experience on the plantation. Brought to
the Americas, stripped of a common spoken language, this dance was a way for enslaved
Africans to remember where they're from. It may have looked something like this. Slapping
thighs, shuffling feet and patting hands: this was how they got around the slave owners'
ban on drumming, improvising complex rhythms just like ancestors did with drums in Haiti
or in the Yoruba communities of West Africa. It was about keeping cultural traditions
alive and retaining a sense of inner freedom under captivity. It was the same subversive
spirit that created this dance: the Cakewalk, a dance that parodied the mannerisms of
Southern high society — a way for the enslaved to throw shade at the masters. The crazy
thing about this dance is that the Cakewalk was performed for the masters, who never
suspected they were being made fun of. Now you might recognize this one. 1920s — the
Charleston.

The Charleston was all about improvisation and musicality, making its way into Lindy Hop,
swing dancing and even the Kid n Play, originally called the Funky Charleston. Started by a
tight-knit Black community near Charleston, South Carolina, the Charleston permeated dance
halls where young women suddenly had the freedom to kick their heels and move their
legs. Now, social dance is about community and connection; if you knew the steps, it meant
you belonged to a group. But what if it becomes a worldwide craze? Enter the Twist. It's
no surprise that the Twist can be traced back to the 19th century, brought to America from
the Congo during slavery. But in the late '50s, right before the Civil Rights Movement,
the Twist is popularized by Chubby Checker and Dick Clark. Suddenly, everybody's doing the
Twist: white teenagers, kids in Latin America, making its way into songs and movies.
Through social dance, the boundaries between groups become blurred. The story continues in
the 1980s and '90s.

Along with the emergence of hip-hop, African-American social dance took on even more
visibility, borrowing from its long past, shaping culture and being shaped by it. Today,
these dances continue to evolve, grow and spread. Why do we dance? To move, to let loose,
to express. Why do we dance together? To heal, to remember, to say: "We speak a common
language. We exist and we are free."
