title: How Romans flooded the Colosseum for sea battles
speaker: Janelle Peters
description: >-
 Starting in 80 CE, residents of Rome and visitors from across the Roman Empire
 would fill the stands of the Colosseum to see gladiators duel, animals fight and
 chariots race around the arena. And for the grand finale, water poured into the
 arena basin, submerging the stage for the greatest spectacle of all: staged naval
 battles. Janelle Peters details the history of these mock maritime encounters.

The cry of the crowd. The roar of a lion. The clash of metal. Starting in 80 CE these
sounds rang through the stands of the Colosseum. On hundreds of days a year, over 50,000
residents of Rome and visitors from across the Roman Empire would fill the stadiums’ four
stories to see gladiators duel, animals fight, and chariots race around the arena. And
for the grand finale, water poured into the arena basin, submerging the stage for the 
greatest spectacle of all: staged naval battles. The Romans’ epic, mock maritime 
encounters, called naumachiae, started during Julius Caesar’s reign in the first century
BC, over a hundred years before the Colosseum was built. They were held alongside other 
aquatic spectacles on natural and artificial bodies of water around Rome up through
Emperor Flavius Vespasian, who began building the Colosseum in 70 CE on the site of a
former lake. The Colosseum was intended to be a symbol of Rome’s power in the ancient
world, and what better way to display that power than a body of water that could drain 
and refill at the Emperor’s command? Vespasian’s son Flavius Titus fulfilled his father’s
dream in 80 CE when he used war spoils to finish the Colosseum– or as it was known at the
time, the Flavian Amphitheater.

The grand opening was celebrated with 100 days of pageantry and gladiatorial games,
setting the precedent for programming that included parades, musical performances, public
executions, and of course, gladiatorial combat. Unlike the games in smaller amphitheaters
 funded by wealthy Romans, these lavish displays of Imperial power were financed by the
Emperor. Parades of exotic animals, theatrical performances, and the awe-inspiring
naumachiae were all designed to bolster faith in the god-like Emperor, who would be
declared a god after his own death. It’s still a mystery how engineers flooded the arena
to create this aquatic effect. Some historians believe a giant aqueduct was diverted into
the arena. Others think the system of chambers and sluice gates used to drain the arena,
were also used to fill it. These chambers could’ve been filled with water prior to the
event and then opened to submerge the stage under more than a million gallons of water,
to create a depth of five feet. But even with all that water, the Romans had to construct
miniature boats with special flat bottoms that wouldn’t scrape the Colosseum
floor.

These boats ranged from 7 to 15 meters long, and were built to look like vessels from
famous encounters. During a battle, dozens of these ships would float around the arena,
crewed by gladiators dressed as the opposing sides of the recreated battle. These
warriors would duel across ships; boarding them, fighting, drowning, and incapacitating
their foes until only one faction was left standing. Fortunately, not every watery display 
told such a gruesome story. In some of these floodings, a submerged stage allowed chariot 
drivers to glide across the water as though they were Triton, making waves as he piloted
his chariot on the sea. Animals walked on water, myths were re-enacted by condemned
prisoners, and at night, nude synchronized swimmers would perform by torchlight. But the
Colosseum’s aquatic age didn’t last forever. The naval battles proved so popular they 
were given their own nearby lake by Emperor Domitian in the early 90s CE.

The larger lake proved even better for naumachiae, and the Colosseum soon gained a series
 of underground animal cages and trap doors that didn’t allow for further flooding. But
for a brief time, the Flavian Emperors controlled the tides of war and water in a
spectacular show of power.
