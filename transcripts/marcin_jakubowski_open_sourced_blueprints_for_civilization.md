title: Open-sourced blueprints for civilization
speaker: Marcin Jakubowski
description: >-
 Using wikis and digital fabrication tools, TED Fellow Marcin Jakubowski is
 open-sourcing the blueprints for 50 farm machines, allowing anyone to build their
 own tractor or harvester from scratch. And that's only the first step in a
 project to write an instruction set for an entire self-sustaining village
 (starting cost: $10,000).

Hi, my name is Marcin — farmer, technologist. I was born in Poland, now in the U.S. I
started a group called Open Source Ecology. We've identified the 50 most important
machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist — things from tractors, bread
ovens, circuit makers. Then we set out to create an open source, DIY, do it yourself
version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost. We call this the
Global Village Construction Set. So let me tell you a story. So I finished my 20s with a
Ph. D. in fusion energy, and I discovered I was useless. I had no practical skills. The
world presented me with options, and I took them. I guess you can call it the consumer
lifestyle. So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming. I
bought a tractor — then it broke. I paid to get it repaired — then it broke again. Then
pretty soon, I was broke too. I realized that the truly appropriate, low-cost tools that I
needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn't exist yet.

I needed tools that were robust, modular, highly efficient and optimized, low-cost, made
from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime, not designed for
obsolescence. I found that I would have to build them myself. So I did just that. And I
tested them. And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale. So
then I published the 3D designs, schematics, instructional videos and budgets on a wiki.
Then contributors from all over the world began showing up, prototyping new machines
during dedicated project visits. So far, we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines. And
now the project is beginning to grow on its own. We know that open source has succeeded
with tools for managing knowledge and creativity. And the same is starting to happen with
hardware too. We're focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people's
lives in such tangible material ways.

If we can lower the barriers to farming, building, manufacturing, then we can unleash just
massive amounts of human potential. That's not only in the developing world. Our tools are
being made for the American farmer, builder, entrepreneur, maker. We've seen lots of
excitement from these people, who can now start a construction business, parts
manufacturing, organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid. Our goal is a
repository of published designs so clear, so complete, that a single burned DVD is
effectively a civilization starter kit. I've planted a hundred trees in a day. I've pressed
5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days.
From what I've seen, this is only the beginning. If this idea is truly sound, then the
implications are significant. A greater distribution of the means of production,
environmentally sound supply chains, and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to
transcend artificial scarcity.

We're exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware
technology. Thank you.
