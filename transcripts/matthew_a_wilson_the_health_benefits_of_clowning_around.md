speaker: Matthew A. Wilson
description: >-
 As a medical clown, TED Resident Matthew A. Wilson takes the old adage that
 laughter is the best medicine very seriously. In this heartwarming talk, he
 shares glimpses of how clowning around can help patients (and medical staff)
 navigate stressful situations -- with no side effects.

I danced with Bella for the first time as Bei Mir Bistu Shein filled the room. And her
blue eyes locked with mine. We took turns singing and forgetting the words. She led, I
followed. A waltz step here, a shimmy here.(Rattle sound)

Hands on our hearts, our foreheads touching, as we communicated through movement and
music, making sense through nonsense. Bella is 83 and lives with dementia. The dance gives
us a chance to find each other. How did I learn to dance with dementia? Because I'm not a
dancer. And I'm not a doctor. But I've played one in the hospital.

I'm a clown doctor. Or a medical clown. My tools are whoopee cushions, shakers(Shaker
rattles)and a red nose. You know the old adage "laughter is the best medicine?" I hear that
a lot. Now, at the same time, there are studies to support it, but right now, I'd like to
take you behind the nose and go beyond the laughter and share a few things that I've seen
skating through ICUs. In my Heelys. Size 11. Because I take medical clowning very, very
seriously.(Deflating sound)

(Deflating sound)(Deflating sound)

My mentor was conducting clown rounds in the hospital when he was approached by a nurse.
They needed to put a tube up the kid's nose. Kid didn't want to do it, so rather than hold
the kid down, they asked my colleague if he could help. So the clown asked for a second
tube and shoved it up his own nose. Kid of like this. Oh, please don't do this at
home.

Now, the kid saw this, grabbed his own tube and promptly stuck it up his own nose, kind of
like this.

The clowns, the nurse and the patient discovered a creative solution for their situation
together. And guess what, there's research to back this up. Randomized controlled trials
in Israel and Italy show that medical clowns can be as effective as tranquilizers with no
side effects. In 2004, I started conducting my own clown rounds at the Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. My colleague and I were invited to accompany a
young six-year-old with the most adorable southern accent, to accompany him while he got
his chemotherapy port flushed, a very uncomfortable and regular procedure. We joined him,
his mom and the nurse in this tiny, closed curtain cubicle. Every medical clown encounter
begins by obtaining consent from the patient. So we ask him if we can be there. He says,
"Sure." We're often the one element that a child could control while they're in the
hospital. So we start with a card trick, fan the deck so he can pick.

But as soon as the nurse approaches with the needle to flush the port, he starts screaming
and cussing like no six-year-old I'd ever heard in my life. So we say, "Hey, should we
come back later?" He stops, mouth open, eyes wet with tears, face flushed pink with anger,
and he smiles, "Oh no, you're fine, I want you to be here." OK. So we start playing a
song, my colleague on recorder, me on whoopee cushion. The nurse approaches with the
needle, and it happens again, this torrent of four-letter words. He went from playing and
laughing to screaming and crying, back and forth until the procedure was complete. For the
first time, I experienced this odd duality of joy and suffering. But not for the last
time. See, when we're there, we're not there merely to distract or make anyone feel better
per se. The medical clowns work moment by moment to create connections between the clowns,
the nurse, the parent and the child.

This provides a source of power or control for the child while supporting the staff with
their work. I've spent over a decade bringing joy and delight to the bedsides of terminally
ill children in the top hospitals in New York City. And you know what I've learned?
Everyone's hurting. Staff, family, patients. The patient's in the hospital because they're
hurting. The family's hurting as they navigate uncertainty, grief and the financial
burdens of care. The staff is hurting, only it's more than burnout. More and more health
care workers are reporting feeling overworked and overextended. Now, I'm not so naive as to
suggest that the solution is to send in the clowns.

But what if? What if the tools of medical clown arts practitioners from around the world
permeated our entire health care system? In 2018, at the Healthcare Clowning International
Meeting, they represented over 150 programs in 50 different countries. University of Haifa
offers a formal undergraduate degree program in medical clowning. Argentina has passed
laws requiring the presence of medical clowns in public hospitals at their largest
province. And this work affects more than the patients. It makes things better for the
whole health care team. One of my favorite games to play in the hospital is elevator music.
I love elevators, because they're a place where paths cross, different worlds meet. It's
intimate, uncomfortably quiet and just begging for a little playful disruption. The doors
close and "The Girl from Ipanema" starts playing on Hammond organ, because I keep a
portable speaker hidden in my pocket.

So for those used to using the silent, sterile elevator, it's a moment of surprise. Folks
have permission to acknowledge or not this disruption. The game grows with every stop,
because as soon as the elevator stops, the music stops. New passengers get on, and the
current passengers get to witness the new passengers — their surprise — as they hear the
elevator music for the first time. You experience the shift of adults standing silently,
strangers in an elevator, to attempting to suppress their mirth, to, "Is this a party or
an elevator," filled with full-on laughter. Research conducted in Brazil, Australia, Canada
and Germany confirm that the artistic interventions of medical clowns improve the work
environment for the staff, beyond the elevator, and support their work administering care.
Promising research in the US indicates that arts programing in the hospital can improve
the work environment, leading to increased job satisfaction and better quality of care. My
work has taught me how to actually be present.

How to breathe in a room with a person in pain. How to connect and build trust, no matter
the age, ability or illness. And how medical clowning is an excellent way of using the
arts to put the care back in health care. Thanks.
