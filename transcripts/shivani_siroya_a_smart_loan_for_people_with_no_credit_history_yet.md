title: A smart loan for people with no credit history (yet)
speaker: Shivani Siroya
description: >-
 Trust: How do you earn it? Banks use credit scores to determine if you're
 trustworthy, but there are about 2.5 billion people around the world who don't
 have one to begin with -- and who can't get a loan to start a business, buy a
 home or otherwise improve their lives. Hear how TED Fellow Shivani Siroya is
 unlocking untapped purchasing power in the developing world with InVenture, a
 start-up that uses mobile data to create a financial identity. "With something as
 simple as a credit score," says Siroya, "we're giving people the power to build
 their own futures."

How much do you need to know about a person before you'd feel comfortable making a
loan? Suppose you wanted to lend 1,000 dollars to the person sitting two rows behind you.
What would you need to know about that person before you'd feel comfortable? My mom came to
the US from India in her late thirties. She's a doctor in Brooklyn, and she often lets
friends and neighbors come to see her for health services, whether they can pay right away
or not. I remember running into her patients with her at the grocery store or on the
sidewalk, and sometimes they would come and pay her right on the spot for previous
appointments. She would thank them, and ask them about their families and their health.
She gave them credit because she trusted them. Most of us are like my mom. We would give
credit to someone we know or that we live next to. But most of us are probably not going
to lend to a stranger unless we know a little something about them. Banks, credit card
companies and other financial institutions don't know us on a personal level, but they do
have a way of trusting us, and that's through our credit scores.

Our credit scores have been created through an aggregation and analysis of our public
consumer credit data. And because of them, we have pretty much easy access to all of the
goods and services that we need, from getting electricity to buying a home, or taking a
risk and starting a business. But ... there are 2.5 billion people around the world that
don't have a credit score. That's a third of the world's population. They don't have a
score because there are no formal public records on them — no bank accounts, no credit
histories and no social security numbers. And because they don't have a score, they don't
have access to the credit or financial products that can improve their lives. They are not
trusted. So we wanted to find a way to build trust and to open up financial access for
these 2.5 billion. So we created a mobile application that builds credit scores for them
using mobile data. There are currently over one billion smartphones in emerging
markets.

And people are using them the same way that we do. They're texting their friends, they're
looking up directions, they're browsing the Internet and they're even making financial
transactions. Over time, this data is getting captured on our phones, and it provides a
really rich picture of a person's life. Our customers give us access to this data and we
capture it through our mobile application. It helps us understand the creditworthiness of
people like Jenipher, a small-business owner in Nairobi, Kenya. Jenipher is 65 years old,
and for decades has been running a food stall in the central business district. She has
three sons who she put through vocational school, and she's also the leader of her local
chama, or savings group. Jenipher's food stall does well. She makes just enough every day
to cover her expenses. But she's not financially secure. Any emergency could force her
into debt. And she has no discretionary income to improve her family's way of living, for
emergencies, or for investing into growing her business.

If Jenipher wants credit, her options are limited. She could get a microloan, but she'd
have to form a group that could help vouch for her credibility. And even then, the loan
sizes would be way too small to really have an impact on her business, averaging around
150 dollars. Loan sharks are always an option, but with interest rates that are well above
300 percent, they're financially risky. And because Jenipher doesn't have collateral or a
credit history, she can't walk into a bank and ask for a business loan. But one day,
Jenipher's son convinced her to download our application and apply for a loan. Jenipher
answered a few questions on her phone and she gave us access to a few key data points on
her device. And here's what we saw. So, bad news first. Jenipher had a low savings balance
and no previous loan history. These are factors that would have thrown up a red flag to a
traditional bank. But there were other points in her history that showed us a much richer
picture of her potential.

So for one, we saw that she made regular phone calls to her family in Uganda. Well, it
turns out that the data shows a four percent increase in repayment among people who
consistently communicate with a few close contacts. We could also see that though she
traveled around a lot throughout the day, she actually had pretty regular travel patterns,
and she was either at home or at her food stall. And the data shows a six percent increase
in repayment among customers who are consistent with where they spend most of their
time. We could also see that she communicated a lot with many different people throughout
the day and that she had a strong support network. Our data shows that people who
communicate with more than 58 different contacts tend to be more likely to be good
borrowers. In Jenipher's case, she communicated with 89 different individuals, which
showed a nine percent increase in her repayment. These are just some of the thousands of
different data points that we look at to understand a person's creditworthiness.

And after analyzing all of these different data points, we took the first risk and gave
Jenipher a loan. This is data that would not be found on a paper trail or in any formal
financial record. But it proves trust. By looking beyond income, we can see that people in
emerging markets that may seem risky and unpredictable on the surface are actually willing
and have the capacity to repay. Our credit scores have helped us deliver over 200,000 loans
in Kenya in just the past year. And our repayment rates are above 90 percent — which, by
the way, is in line with traditional bank repayment rates. With something as simple as a
credit score, we're giving people the power to build their own futures. Our customers have
used their loans for family expenses, emergencies, travel and for investing back into
growing their businesses. They're now building better economies and communities where more
people can succeed. Over the past two years of using our product, Jenipher has increased
her savings by 60 percent.

She's also started two additional food stalls and is now making plans for her own
restaurant. She's applying for a small-business loan from a commercial bank, because she
now has the credit history to prove she deserves it. I saw Jenipher in Nairobi just last
week, and she told me how excited she was to get started. She said, "Only my son believed
I could do this. I didn't think this was for me." She's lived her whole life believing
that there was a part of the world that was closed off to her. Our job now is to open the
world to Jenipher and the billions like her that deserve to be trusted. Thank
you.
