It begins with a bit of discomfort and soon becomes a pressing sensation that's impossible
to ignore. Finally, it's all you can think about, and out of sheer desperation, you go on
a hunt for a bathroom until "ahh." Humans should urinate at least four to six times a day,
but occasionally, the pressures of modern life forces us to clench and hold it in. How bad
is this habit, and how long can our bodies withstand it? The answers lie in the workings
of the bladder, an oval pouch that sits inside the pelvis. Surrounding this structure 
are several other organs that together make up the whole urinary system. Two kidneys, two
ureters, two urethral sphincters, and a urethra. Constantly trickling down from the
kidneys is the yellowish liquid known as urine. The kidneys make urine from a mix of water
and the body's waste products, funneling the unwanted fluid into two muscular tubes called
ureters. These carry it downward into the hollow organ known as the bladder.

This organ's muscular wall is made of tissue called detrusor muscle which relaxes as the
bladder fills allowing it to inflate like a balloon. As the bladder gets full, the
detrusor contracts. The internal urethral sphincter automatically and involuntarily opens,
and the urine is released. Whooshing downwards, the fluid enters the urethra and stops
short at the external urethral sphincter. This works like a tap. When you want to delay
urinating, you keep the sphincter closed. When you want to release it, you can voluntarily
open the flood gates. But how do you sense your bladder's fullness so you know when to
pee? Inside the layers of detrusor muscles are millions of stretch receptors that get
triggered as the bladder fills. They send signals along your nerves to the sacral region
in your spinal cord. A reflex signal travels back to your bladder, making the detrusor
muscle contract slightly and increasing the bladder's pressure so you're aware that it's
filling up.

Simultaneously, the internal urethral sphincter opens. This is called the micturition
reflex. The brain can counter it if it's not a good time to urinate by sending another
signal to contract the external urethral sphincter. With about 150 to 200 milliliters of
urine inside of it, the bladder's muscular wall is stretched enough for you to sense 
that there's urine within. At about 400 to 500 milliliters, the pressure becomes
uncomfortable. The bladder can go on stretching, but only to a point. Above 1,000
milliliters, it may burst. Most people would lose bladder control before this happens, but
in very rare cases, such as when as a person can't sense the need to urinate, the pouch
can rupture painfully requiring surgery to fix. But under normal circumstances, your
decision to urinate stops the brain's signal to the external urethral sphincter, causing
it to relax and the bladder to empty.

The external urethral sphincter is one of the muscles of the pelvic floor, and it provides
support to the urethra and bladder neck. It's lucky we have these pelvic floor muscles
because placing pressure on the system by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or jumping could
cause bladder leakage. Instead, the pelvic floor muscles keep the region sealed until
you're ready to go. But holding it in for too long, forcing out your urine too fast, or
urinating without proper physical support may over time weaken or overwork that muscular
sling. That can lead to an overactive pelvic floor, bladder pain, urgency, or urinary
incontinence. So in the interest of long-term health, it's not a great habit to hold your
pee. But in the short term, at least, your body and brain have got you covered, so you can
conveniently choose your moment of sweet release.
