title: Don't like clickbait? Don't click
speaker: Sally Kohn
description: >-
 Doesn't it seem like a lot of online news sites have moved beyond reporting the
 news to openly inciting your outrage (and your page views)? News analyst Sally
 Kohn suggests â€” don't engage with news that looks like it just wants to make you
 mad. Instead, give your precious clicks to the news sites you truly trust.

So recently, some white guys and some black women swapped Twitter avatars, or pictures
online. They didn't change their content, they kept tweeting the same as usual, but
suddenly, the white guys noticed they were getting called the n-word all the time and they
were getting the worst kind of online abuse, whereas the black women all of a sudden
noticed things got a lot more pleasant for them. Now, if you're my five-year-old, your
Internet consists mostly of puppies and fairies and occasionally fairies riding puppies.
That's a thing. Google it. But the rest of us know that the Internet can be a really ugly
place. I'm not talking about the kind of colorful debates that I think are healthy for our
democracy. I'm talking about nasty personal attacks. Maybe it's happened to you, but it's
at least twice as likely to happen, and be worse, if you're a woman, a person of color, or
gay, or more than one at the same time.

In fact, just as I was writing this talk, I found a Twitter account called
@SallyKohnSucks. The bio says that I'm a "man-hater and a bull dyke and the only thing
I've ever accomplished with my career is spreading my perverse sexuality." Which,
incidentally, is only a third correct. I mean, lies! 

But seriously, we all say we hate this crap. The question is whether you're willing to
make a personal sacrifice to change it. I don't mean giving up the Internet. I mean
changing the way you click, because clicking is a public act. It's no longer the case that
a few powerful elites control all the media and the rest of us are just passive receivers.
Increasingly, we're all the media. I used to think, oh, okay, I get dressed up, I put on a
lot of makeup, I go on television, I talk about the news. That is a public act of making
media. And then I go home and I browse the web and I'm reading Twitter, and that's a
private act of consuming media. I mean, of course it is. I'm in my pajamas. Wrong.
Everything we blog, everything we Tweet, and everything we click is a public act of making
media. We are the new editors. We decide what gets attention based on what we give our
attention to. That's how the media works now.

There's all these hidden algorithms that decide what you see more of and what we all see
more of based on what you click on, and that in turn shapes our whole culture. Over three
out of five Americans think we have a major incivility problem in our country right now,
but I'm going to guess that at least three out of five Americans are clicking on the same
insult-oriented, rumor-mongering trash that feeds the nastiest impulses in our society. In
an increasingly noisy media landscape, the incentive is to make more noise to be heard,
and that tyranny of the loud encourages the tyranny of the nasty. It does not have to be
that way. It does not. We can change the incentive. For starters, there are two things we
can all do. First, don't just stand by the sidelines when you see someone getting hurt. If
someone is being abused online, do something. Be a hero. This is your chance. Speak up.
Speak out. Be a good person. Drown out the negative with the positive.

And second, we've got to stop clicking on the lowest-common-denominator, bottom-feeding
linkbait. If you don't like the 24/7 all Kardashian all the time programming, you've got
to stop clicking on the stories about Kim Kardashian's sideboob. I know you do it.

You too, apparently. I mean, really, same example: if you don't like politicians calling
each other names, stop clicking on the stories about what one guy in one party called the
other guy in the other party. Clicking on a train wreck just pours gasoline on it. It
makes it worse, the fire spreads. Our whole culture gets burned. If what gets the most
clicks wins, then we have to start shaping the world we want with our clicks, because
clicking is a public act. So click responsibly. Thank you.
