Shah Rukh Khan: Something goes wrong with the air that we take for granted. The ill
effects are suffered by all, rich and poor, city people and village folks, those inland
and those on the coast. Nobody is exempt. So how do we give our children the chance to
grow up in a world where the air is clean? Our next speaker addresses this vital question.
So join me in giving a wholehearted welcome to the public policy expert and author, the
multifaceted Dr. Arunabha Ghosh.

Arunabha Ghosh: Let me tell you a story from China. In 2014, China declared war on
pollution. In November that year, there was an international summit there. Presidents and
prime ministers from many countries arrived. So industries around Beijing were shut down,
half the cars were taken off the road. That week, I took a photograph of the unusually
blue sky in Beijing. A few days later, when the summit had ended, the factories were
humming again, the sky had again turned light grey. So newspapers started urging the
government to make the blue skies permanent. Then in early 2015, a private citizen
produced a documentary on air pollution called "Under the Dome." Just within four days, it
was viewed 300 million times, and millions more continued discussing it on social media.
Eventually, the government acted, and by 2018, the bulk of the Chinese population had
witnessed a decline in air pollution by 32 percent on average. When will we demand clean
air in India? I have a six-year-old daughter.

Every morning, when I drop her to the school bus stop, I have to remind her not to take
off her mask. That's the kind of world we live in. One day she pointed me to an
advertisement for a face wash, which claimed that the polluting particles lodged deeply in
our skin could be miraculously washed off. But what of the particles lodged in our lungs?
When it's difficult to make out the difference between the lung of a smoker and the lung
of a nonsmoker, we have a real problem, because I can run an air purifier at home, but can
I lock up my daughter at home? Air pollution is the great leveler. It affects us all, rich
and poor, city dweller or village folk, those living inland or those living on the coast,
and it's affecting our health, our economic growth, our quality of life. In 2017, more
than 1.2 million deaths in India were attributable to air pollution. That's more than
those deaths caused by HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria or diarrhea. At the Council on
Energy, Environment and Water, my colleagues find that today, one in two Indians is
breathing air that does not meet our air quality standards.

And the economic impact of this public health crisis is more than 80 billion dollars every
year. At CEEW, my colleagues find that 80 percent of Indians can breathe clean air if we
adopted stringent pollution controls. So here is my vision for India. In 2027, when we are
celebrating our 80th year of independence, can we ensure that, by then, 80 cities in India
have reduced air pollution by 80 percent? Let's called this Mission 80-80-80, and this is
possible, but the role of citizens is going to be critical. To combat air pollution, we
have to create a democratic demand for clean air. We can make this happen. First, we have
to educate ourselves. Low-cost sensors give us real-time information about the air
quality, but we still need information about how to interpret it and how to act. So we
need to target information to schools and children, to resident welfare associations, to
the elderly, who are more at risk.

You know, when the temperature outside is 30 degrees versus 40 degrees, we know how to
dress, we know what to do, what not to do. We need, similarly, information on what
precautions to take when the air quality outside is poor, very poor, severe or
hazardous. Second, we need to become active monitors. Today, most Indian cities and much of
rural India have no air quality monitoring at all. So we need to demand that air quality
sensors are installed in every constituency. Today, in Parliament, who is going to stand
up for us as the air quality warrior? When enforcement agencies land up at polluting sites
or dust-spewing construction sites, their whack-a-mole approach doesn't always work,
because as soon as their attention turns somewhere else, the offenders go back to business
as usual. We citizens have to become the fire alarms. We have to demand emergency call-in
numbers and specialized task forces that can respond in real time to pollution
sites.

So we need not just the authority but the enforcement strength to crack down. Third, we
have to be prepared to pay a price, whether it's for cars using BS6 fuel or for more
expensive electricity from cleaner power plants. Last year, just before Diwali, I took a
surprise inspection of polluting industries in an unauthorized industrial area just
outside of Delhi, and I found polluting firecrackers were being sold. The Supreme Court
had mandated only green firecrackers could be sold, but those were nowhere to be found.
But the polluting ones were available. Why? Because we were ready to buy. As citizens, we
have to reduce the demand for these polluting products or be prepared to pay more for
cleaner products. Fourth step: let's build some empathy for our fellow citizens. How much
does it take to keep a night guard warm rather than force them to burn rubbish to stay
warm in winter? Or, let's take farmers.

You know, it's very easy to blame them for burning the stubble of the rice paddy crop
every winter, which causes air pollution. It's much harder to understand that it's the
combination of our agricultural policy and our groundwater crisis that often leaves the
farmer with no option but to burn the stubble. So we need to draw in the urban poor
laborer or the rural poor farmer into our collective call for clean air. Farmers come and
tell us that they want to adopt sustainable agriculture, but they need some help. And
fifth, we have to change our lifestyles. Yes, public transport is often not available, but
the choice to buy a cleaner, less polluting private vehicle is ours. The choice to
segregate and recycle household waste is ours. You know, in Surat after the 1994 plague,
citizens there take pride in keeping their city one of the cleanest in the country. Down
south in Mysore, public-private partnerships and citizen-led eco clubs are coming together
to reduce, segregate and recycle waste in a manner that landfills can be eliminated
altogether.

Now I'm not saying that officials have no responsibility here, but it is our collective
apathy that takes the pressure off of our parliamentarians, the bureaucrats or the
enforcement agencies. Mission 80-80-80 will only begin when we demand it. We have to create
a democratic demand for clean air, because citizens, you and me, can decide what kind of
air we breathe. Thank you.

SRK: Thank you so much. Tell me something: India, our country, do we have any advantages?
Have we become aware of it earlier because of all the inputs from people like you? AG: Our
biggest strength: our people and our ability to make change without always necessarily
relying only on the government. And that strength of civil society and civil demand for a
civilized living condition is, I think, our biggest asset. Then, all of those and more
will happen.

SRK: Thank you, Dr. Ghosh. Bless you for coming here. And it's very enlightening. Thank
you very much, and all the best with 80-80-80.Dr. Ghosh, everyone. AG: Thank
you.
