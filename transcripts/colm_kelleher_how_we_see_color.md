title: How we see color
speaker: Colm Kelleher
description: >-
 There are three types of color receptors in your eye: red, green and blue. But
 how do we see the amazing kaleidoscope of other colors that make up our world?
 Colm Kelleher explains how humans can see everything from auburn to aquamarine.

You might have heard that light is a kind of wave and that the color of an object is
related to the frequency of light waves it reflects. High-frequency light waves look
violet, low-frequency light waves look red, and in-between frequencies look yellow, green,
orange, and so on. You might call this idea physical color because it says that color is a
physical property of light itself. It's not dependent on human perception. And, while this
isn't wrong, it isn't quite the whole story either. For instance, you might have seen this
picture before. As you can see, the region where the red and green lights overlap is
yellow. When you think about it, this is pretty weird. Because light is a wave, two
different frequencies shouldn't interact with each other at all, they should just co-exist
like singers singing in harmony. So, in this yellow looking region, two different kinds of
light waves are present: one with a red frequency, and one with a green
frequency.

There is no yellow light present at all. So, how come this region, where the red and green
lights mix, looks yellow to us? To understand this, you have to understand a little bit
about biology, in particular, about how humans see color. Light perception happens in a
paper-thin layer of cells, called the retina, that covers the back of your eyeball. In the
retina, there are two different types of light-detecting cells: rods and cones. The rods
are used for seeing in low-light conditions, and there is only one kind of those. The
cones, however, are a different story. There three kinds of cone cells that roughly
correspond to the colors red, green, and blue. When you see a color, each cone sends its
own distinct signal to your brain. For example, suppose that yellow light, that is real
yellow light, with a yellow frequency, is shining on your eye. You don't have a cone
specifically for detecting yellow, but yellow is kind of close to green and also kind of
close to red, so both the red and green cones get activated, and each sends a signal to
your brain saying so.

Of course, there is another way to activate the red cones and the green cones
simultaneously: if both red light and green light are present at the same time. The point
is, your brain receives the same signal, regardless of whether you see light that has the
yellow frequency or light that is a mixture of the green and red frequencies. That's why,
for light, red plus green equals yellow. And, how come you can't detect colors when it's
dark? Well, the rod cells in your retina take over in low-light conditions. You only have
one kind of rod cell, and so there is one type of signal that can get sent to your brain:
light or no light. Having only one kind of light detector doesn't leave any room for
seeing color. There are infinitely many different physical colors, but, because we only
have three kinds of cones, the brain can be tricked into thinking it's seeing any color by
carefully adding together the right combination of just three colors: red, green, and
blue.

This property of human vision is really useful in the real world. For example, TV
manufacturing. Instead of having to put infinitely many colors in your TV set to simulate
the real world, TV manufacturers only have to put three: red, green, and blue, which is
lucky for them, really.
