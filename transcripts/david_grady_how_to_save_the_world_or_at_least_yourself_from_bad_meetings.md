Picture this: It's Monday morning, you're at the office, you're settling in for the day at
work, and this guy that you sort of recognize from down the hall, walks right into your
cubicle and he steals your chair. Doesn't say a word — just rolls away with it. Doesn't
give you any information about why he took your chair out of all the other chairs that
are out there. Doesn't acknowledge the fact that you might need your chair to get some
work done today. You wouldn't stand for it. You'd make a stink. You'd follow that guy
back to his cubicle and you'd say, "Why my chair?"Okay, so now it's Tuesday morning and
you're at the office, and a meeting invitation pops up in your calendar.

And it's from this woman who you kind of know from down the hall, and the subject line
references some project that you heard a little bit about. But there's no agenda. There's
no information about why you were invited to the meeting. And yet you accept the meeting
invitation, and you go. And when this highly unproductive session is over, you go back to
your desk, and you stand at your desk and you say, "Boy, I wish I had those two hours
back, like I wish I had my chair back." 

Every day, we allow our coworkers, who are otherwise very, very nice people, to steal
from us. And I'm talking about something far more valuable than office furniture. I'm
talking about time. Your time. In fact, I believe that we are in the middle of a global
epidemic of a terrible new illness known as MAS: Mindless Accept Syndrome.

The primary symptom of Mindless Accept Syndrome is just accepting a meeting invitation
the minute it pops up in your calendar. 

It's an involuntary reflex — ding, click, bing — it's in your calendar, "Gotta go, I'm
already late for a meeting." 

Meetings are important, right? And collaboration is key to the success of any enterprise.
And a well-run meeting can yield really positive, actionable results. But between
globalization and pervasive information technology, the way that we work has really
changed dramatically over the last few years. And we're miserable. 

And we're miserable not because the other guy can't run a good meeting, it's because of
MAS, our Mindless Accept Syndrome, which is a self-inflicted wound. Actually, I have
evidence to prove that MAS is a global epidemic. Let me tell you why. A couple of years
ago, I put a video on Youtube, and in the video, I acted out every terrible conference
call you've ever been on. It goes on for about five minutes, and it has all the things
that we hate about really bad meetings. There's the moderator who has no idea how to run
the meeting. There are the participants who have no idea why they're there. The whole
thing kind of collapses into this collaborative train wreck. And everybody leaves very
angry. It's kind of funny. 

Let's take a quick look. 

Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal. As a group, we
need to decide if — bloop bloop — Hi, who just joined? Hi, it's Joe. I'm working from home
today. 

Hi, Joe. Thanks for joining us today, great. I was just saying, we have a lot of people 
on the call we'd like to get through, so let's skip the roll call and I'm gonna dive
right in. Our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal. As a
group, we need to decide if — bloop bloop — 

Hi, who just joined? No? I thought I heard a beep. 

Sound familiar? Yeah, it sounds familiar to me, too. A couple of weeks after I put that
online, 500,000 people in dozens of countries, I mean dozens of countries, watched this
video. And three years later, it's still getting thousands of views every month. It's
close to about a million right now. And in fact, some of the biggest companies in the
world, companies that you've heard of but I won't name, have asked for my permission to
use this video in their new-hire training to teach their new employees how not to run a
meeting at their company. And if the numbers — there are a million views and it's being
used by all these companies — aren't enough proof that we have a global problem with
meetings, there are the many, many thousands of comments posted online after the video
went up. Thousands of people wrote things like, "OMG, that was my day today!" "That was my
day every day!" "This is my life." One guy wrote, "It's funny because it's true. Eerily,
sadly, depressingly true.

It made me laugh until I cried. And cried. And I cried some more." 

This poor guy said, "My daily life until retirement or death, sigh." These are real
quotes and it's real sad. A common theme running through all of these comments online is
this fundamental belief that we are powerless to do anything other than go to meetings
and suffer through these poorly run meetings and live to meet another day. But the truth
is, we're not powerless at all. In fact, the cure for MAS is right here in our hands.
It's right at our fingertips, literally. It's something that I call ¡No MAS!

Which, if I remember my high school Spanish, means something like, "Enough already, make
it stop!"Here's how No MAS works. It's very simple. First of all, the next time you get
a meeting invitation that doesn't have a lot of information in it at all, click the
tentative button! It's okay, you're allowed, that's why it's there. It's right next to
the accept button. Or the maybe button, or whatever button is there for you not to accept
immediately. Then, get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting. Tell them
you're very excited to support their work, ask them what the goal of the meeting is, and
tell them you're interested in learning how you can help them achieve their goal. And if
we do this often enough, and we do it respectfully, people might start to be a little bit
more thoughtful about the way they put together meeting invitations. And you can make more
thoughtful decisions about accepting it. People might actually start sending out
agendas.

Imagine! Or they might not have a conference call with 12 people to talk about a status
when they could just do a quick email and get it done with. People just might start to
change their behavior because you changed yours. And they just might bring your chair
back, too. 

No MAS! Thank you.
