I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known
interviewer on television, "I'm really getting into the Internet lately. I just wish it
were more organized." So ... 

If I controlled the Internet, you could auction your broken heart on eBay. Take the money;
go to Amazon; buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to — call folks at random
until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language.

If I were in charge of the Internet, you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings. Hang
left at cranky, right at preoccupied, U-turn on silent treatment, all the way back to
tongue kissing and good lovin'. You could navigate and understand every emotional
intersection. Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan, but I still stretch miles in all
directions. If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com would be one big
website. That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and
you're really just chattin' with your pals.

Heck, if I ran the Web, you could email dead people.

They would not email you back 

— but you'd get an automated reply.

Their name in your inbox 

— it's all you wanted anyway. And a message saying, "Hey, it's me. I miss
you.

Listen, you'll see being dead is dandy. Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace
and craving candy." If I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in
an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword, trashcan lid for a shield, shouting, "I am the
emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges." Now follow
me, OK?

Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions. One, two, three.
That links with hotdiggitydog.com. That is my grandfather. They take you to
gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad. He forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom,
who downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges, who grows up to be me — the
guy who usually goes too far. So if I were emperor of the Internet, I guess I'd still be
mortal, huh? But at that point, I would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage
and the most enlarged possible penis 

— so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office. I wouldn't need it. I'd be like some
kind of Internet genius, and me, I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that —
pop! — I'd go wireless.

Huh? Maybe Google would hire this. I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a
virus until the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organized as I think a
modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee, you want to bet just how whack and un-PC
your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net? I guess it's
just like life. It is not a question of if you can — it's: do ya? We can interfere with
the interface. We can make "You've got Hallelujah" the national anthem of cyberspace every
lucky time we log on. You don't say a prayer. You don't write a psalm. You don't chant an
"om." You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.
Thank you, TED.
