title: Why aren't we only using solar power?
speaker: Alexandros Charalambides
description: >-
 Solar power is cheaper and more sustainable than our current coal-fueled power
 plants, so why haven't we made the switch? The real culprits here are the clouds,
 which make solar power difficult to control. Alexandros George Charalambides
 explains how solar towers and panels create electricity and how scientists are
 trying to create a system that can function even under cloud cover. [Directed by
 Richard O'Connor, narrated by Addison Anderson].

We have some good reasons to completely switch over to solar power. It's cheaper in many
cases, and definitely more sustainable than our dependance on traditional power plants
that use resources like coal, which will eventually run out. So why don't we replace these
traditional plants with solar energy? Because there's one factor that makes solar power
very unpredictable: cloud cover. As the sun's rays move towards Earth, some get absorbed
by the Earth's atmosphere, some are reflected back into outer space, but the rest make it
to the Earth's surface. The ones that aren't deviated are called direct irradiance. The
ones that are deflected by clouds are called diffuse irradiance. And those rays that first
get reflected by a surface, like a nearby building, before reaching the solar energy
system are called reflected irradiance. But before we can examine how clouds affect the
sun's rays and electricity production, let's see how these solar energy systems
work.

First up, we have solar towers. These are made up of a central tower surrounded by a huge
field of mirrors that track the sun's path and focus only the direct rays onto a single
point on the tower, kind of like an eager beachgoer. The heat generated by these rays is
so immense that it can be used to boil water producing steam that drives a traditional
turbine, which makes electricity. But when we say solar energy systems, we're usually
talking about photovoltaics, or solar panels, which are the systems most commonly used to
generate solar power. In solar panels, photons from the sun's rays hit the surface of a
panel, and electrons are released to get an electric current going. Solar panels can use
all types of irradiance, while solar towers can only use direct irradiance, and this is
where clouds become important because depending on their type and location relative to the
sun, they can either increase or decrease the amount of electricity produced.

For instance, even a few cumulus clouds in front of the sun can reduce the electricity
production in solar towers to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays. In
solar panels, those clouds would decrease energy output as well, though not as much
because solar panels can use all types of irradiance. However, all this depends on the
clouds exact positioning. Due to reflection, or a particular phenomeon called Mie
scattering, the sun's rays can actually be focused forward by clouds to create a more than
50% increase in the solar irradiance reaching a solar panel. If this potential increase
isn't accounted for, it could damage the solar panel. Why does this matter? Well, you
wouldn't want this lesson to stop just because a cloud passed over the panel on your roof.
In solar towers, huge tanks of molten salt or oil can be used to store any excess heat and
use it when needed, so that's how they manage the problem of fluctuating solar irradiance
to smooth out electricity production.

But in the case of solar panels, there currently isn't any way to affordably store extra
energy. That's where traditional power plants come in because to correct for any
fluctuations in these solar powered plants, extra electricity from traditional sources
always needs to be available. But then why aren't these tradtional power plants just used
as a backup, instead of us humans depending on them as our main sources of energy? Because
it's impossible for an employee at a coal fired or a nuclear plant to turn a knob to
produce more or less electricity depending on how many clouds there are in the sky. The
response time would simply be too slow. Instead, to accommodate these fluctuations, some
extra electricity from traditional power plants is always being produced. On clear sky
days, that extra electricity might be wasted, but when cloudy skies prevail, it's what
fills the gap. This is what we currently depend on for a constant supply of
energy.

For this reason, a lot of researchers are interested in forcasting the motion and
formation of clouds through satellite images or cameras that look up at the sky to
maximize the energy from solar power plants and minimize energy waste. If we could
accomplish that, you'd be able to enjoy this video powered solely by the sun's rays, no
matter what the weather, although if the sun is shining, you may be tempted to venture
outside to go and do a different kind of cloud gazing.
