title: What happens when you remove the hippocampus?
speaker: Sam Kean
description: >-
 When Henry Molaison (now widely known as H.M.) cracked his skull in an accident,
 he began blacking out and having seizures. In an attempt to cure him, daredevil
 surgeon Dr. William Skoville removed H.M.'s hippocampus. Luckily, the seizures
 did go away â€” but so did his long-term memory! Sam Kean walks us through this
 astonishing medical case, detailing everything H.M. taught us about the brain and
 memory. [Directed by Anton Bogaty, narrated by Addison Anderson].

On September 1st, 1953, William Scoville used a hand crank and a cheap drill saw to bore
into a young man's skull, cutting away vital pieces of his brain and sucking them out
through a metal tube. But this wasn't a scene from a horror film or a gruesome police
report. Dr. Scoville was one of the most renowned neurosurgeons of his time, and the
young man was Henry Molaison, the famous patient known as "H.M.", whose case provided
amazing insights into how our brains work. As a boy, Henry had cracked his skull in an
accident and soon began having seizures, blacking out and losing control of bodily
functions. After enduring years of frequent episodes, and even dropping out of high
school, the desperate young man had turned to Dr. Scoville, a daredevil known for risky
surgeries. Partial lobotomies had been used for decades to treat mental patients based on
the notion that mental functions were strictly localized to corresponding brain
areas.

Having successfully used them to reduce seizures in psychotics, Scoville decided to remove
 H.M.'s hippocampus, a part of the limbic system that was associated with emotion but
whose function was unknown. At first glance, the operation had succeeded. H.M.'s seizures
virtually disappeared, with no change in personality, and his IQ even improved. But there
was one problem: His memory was shot. Besides losing most of his memories from the
previous decade, H.M. was unable to form new ones, forgetting what day it was, repeating
comments, and even eating multiple meals in a row. When Scoville informed another expert,
Wilder Penfield, of the results, he sent a Ph. D student named Brenda Milner to study H.M.
at his parents' home, where he now spent his days doing odd chores, and watching classic
movies for the first time, over and over. What she discovered through a series of tests
and interviews didn't just contribute greatly to the study of memory. It redefined what
memory even meant.

One of Milner's findings shed light on the obvious fact that although H.M. couldn't form
new memories, he still retained information long enough from moment to moment to finish a
sentence or find the bathroom. When Milner gave him a random number, he managed to
remember it for fifteen minutes by repeating it to himself constantly. But only five
minutes later, he forgot the test had even taken place. Neuroscientists had though of
memory as monolithic, all of it essentially the same and stored throughout the brain.
Milner's results were not only the first clue for the now familiar distinction between
short-term and long-term memory, but show that each uses different brain regions. We now
know that memory formation involves several steps. After immediate sensory data is
temporarily transcribed by neurons in the cortex, it travels to the hippocampus, where
special proteins work to strengthen the cortical synaptic connections.

If the experience was strong enough, or we recall it periodically in the first few days,
the hippocampus then transfers the memory back to the cortex for permanent storage. H.M.'s
mind could form the initial impressions, but without a hippocampus to perform this memory
consolidation, they eroded, like messages scrawled in sand. But this was not the only
memory distinction Milner found. In a now famous experiment, she asked H.M. to trace a
third star in the narrow space between the outlines of two concentric ones while he could
only see his paper and pencil through a mirror. Like anyone else performing such an
awkward task for the first time, he did horribly. But surprisingly, he improved over 
repeated trials, even though he had no memory of previous attempts. His unconscious motor
centers remembered what the conscious mind had forgotten. What Milner had discovered was
that the declarative memory of names, dates and facts is different from the procedural
memory of riding a bicycle or signing your name.

And we now know that procedural memory relies more on the basal ganglia and cerebellum,
structures that were intact in H.M.'s brain. This distinction between "knowing that" and
"knowing how" has underpinned all memory research since. H.M. died at the age of 82 after
a mostly peaceful life in a nursing home. Over the years, he had been examined by more
than 100 neuroscientists, making his the most studied mind in history. Upon his death,
his brain was preserved and scanned before being cut into over 2000 individual slices and
photographed to form a digital map down to the level of individual neurons, all in a live
broadcast watched by 400,000 people. Though H.M. spent most of his life forgetting things,
he and his contributions to our understanding of memory will be remembered for 
generations to come.
