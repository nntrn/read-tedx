 Chemotherapy kills cancer -- but it kills the rest of your body, too. Instead of
 using human design to fight cancer, why not use nature's? In this quick talk,
 Wayne explains how her lab is creating nanoparticle treatments that bind to
 immune cells, your body's first responders, to precisely target cancer cells
 without damaging healthy ones.

After decades of research and billions of dollars spent in clinical trials, we still have
a problem with cancer drug delivery. We still give patients chemotherapy, which is so
non-specific that even though it kills the cancer cells, it kind of kills the rest of your
body, too. And yes, we have developed more selective drugs, but it's still a challenge to
get them into the tumor, and they end up accumulating in the other organs as well or
passing through your urine, which is a total waste. And fields like mine have emerged
where we try to encapsulate these drugs to protect them as they travel through the body.
But these modifications cause problems that we make more modifications to fix. So what I'm
really trying to say is we need a better drug delivery system. And I propose, rather than
using solely human design, why not use nature's? Immune cells are these versatile vehicles
that travel throughout our body, patrolling for signs of disease and arriving at a wound
mere minutes after injury.

So I ask you guys: If immune cells are already traveling to places of injury or disease in
our bodies, why not add an extra passenger? Why not use immune cells to deliver drugs to
cure some of our biggest problems in disease? I am a biomedical engineer, and I want to
tell you guys a story about how I use immune cells to target one of the largest problems
in cancer. Did you know that over 90 percent of cancer deaths can be attributed to its
spread? So if we can stop these cancer cells from going from the primary tumor to a
distant site, we can stop cancer right in its tracks and give people more of their lives
back. To do this special mission, we decided to deliver a nanoparticle made of lipids,
which are the same materials that compose your cell membrane. And we've added two special
molecules. One is called e-selectin, which acts as a glue that binds the nanoparticle to
the immune cell. And the second one is called trail.

Trail is a therapeutic drug that kills cancer cells but not normal cells. Now, when you
put both of these together, you have a mean killing machine on wheels. To test this, we ran
an experiment in a mouse. So what we did was we injected the nanoparticles, and they bound
almost immediately to the immune cells in the bloodstream. And then we injected the cancer
cells to mimic a process through which cancer cells spread throughout our bodies. And we
found something very exciting. We found that in our treated group, over 75 percent of the
cancer cells we initially injected were dead or dying, in comparison to only around 25
percent. So just imagine: these fewer amount of cells were available to actually be able
to spread to a different part of the body. And this is only after two hours of
treatment. Our results were amazing, and we had some pretty interesting press. My favorite
title was actually, "Sticky balls may stop the spread of cancer."

I can't tell you just how smug my male colleagues were, knowing that their sticky balls
might one day cure cancer.

But I can tell you they made some pretty, pretty, exciting, pretty ballsy t-shirts. This
was also my first experience talking to patients where they asked how soon our therapy
would be available. And I keep these stories with me to remind me of the importance of the
science, the scientists and the patients. Now, our fast-acting results were pretty
interesting, but we still had one lingering question: Can our sticky balls, our particles
actually attached to the immune cells, actually stop the spread of cancer? So we went to
our animal model, and we found three important parts. Our primary tumors were smaller in
our treated animals, there were fewer cells in circulation, and there was little to no
tumor burden in the distant organs. Now, this wasn't just a victory for us and our sticky
balls. This was also a victory to me in drug delivery, and it represents a paradigm shift,
a revolution â€” to go from just using drugs, just injecting them and hoping they go to the
right places in the body, to using immune cells as special delivery drivers in your
body.

For this example, we used two molecules, e-selectin and trail, but really, the possibility
of drugs you can use are endless. And I talked about cancer, but where disease goes, so do
immune cells. So this could be used for any disease. Imagine using immune cells to deliver
crucial wound-healing agents after a spinal cord injury, or using immune cells to deliver
drugs past the blood-brain barrier to treat Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. These are
the ideas that excite me about science the most. And from where I stand, I see so much
promise and opportunity. Thank you.
