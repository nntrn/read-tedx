title: How you can make a fruit fly eat veggies
speaker: Greg Gage
description: >-
 Can the mind be manipulated to love a food we loathe? The evidence from fruit
 flies is compelling, and perhaps surprising. Our tag team of neuroscientists
 attempts to change a fly's preference for fruit over vegetables simply by shining
 a light on their brain.

Greg Gage: It's an age-old pursuit of all parents, getting their kids to eat their
vegetables. But getting them to eat cookies or ice cream is relatively easy, and that's
because our brains prefer sweetness. Now, there's a new technology called optogenetics
which may be able to trick our taste buds, for instance preferring vegetables over sweets.
We're going to try this today using fruit flies.[DIY Neuroscience]The reason why we
experiment with fruit flies is they have a small enough nervous system that gives us a
fighting chance to really understand what's going on. And believe it or not, their taste
buds are very similar to ours. But before we try to manipulate their taste preferences, we
need to establish: What is the baseline of the fruit fly? What does it prefer? We call
this a control experiment. Spencer's been hard at work doing this. OK, Spencer, let's do
our first experiment. We want to test to see if fruit flies prefer bananas or
broccoli.

So what do we need? Spencer Brown: So we need the fly pad, which is basically an iPad for
flies. It measures the touch. GG: You put a fly in each chamber? SB: Yeah. Inside, we'll
offer them banana and broccoli to see which one they prefer. GG: In order to count how many
times the fruit fly eats a banana versus the broccoli, these chambers have been outfitted
with a small electrode that sends data to a computer. And so what were your findings on
banana versus broccoli? SB: I found that the flies visited banana the most. GG: Both were
there, but like most kids, they choose not to eat the broccoli, and they go switch to
something sweeter. GG: Now a quick background on how taste works. Taste buds are made up of
specialized neurons called taste receptors. When we eat something that triggers a
particular taste, those taste neurons will fire a signal to the brain. This allows our
brain to know what's sweet and what's bitter. So when a fruit fly eats a banana, its sweet
taste neurons will fire.

But when it eats broccoli, those same neurons stay pretty quiet. But what if we could
force those sweet-tasting neurons to fire every time the fruit fly eats broccoli? We may
be able to get the fruit fly to like broccoli as much as banana. Enter optogenetics. This
is the revolutionary new tool that's taking neuroscience by storm, and in this case,
"opto" means light and "genetic" refers to the fact that these fruit flies have been
modified to contain a special gene that makes only certain neurons respond to light. In
our case, we've added the special gene to the sweet taste receptors. Now here's the fun
part. Optogenetics means that we can control these special neurons whenever they're
exposed to a bright-colored light, causing them to send messages to the brain. In this
experiment, we're going to have these modified fruit flies choose between banana and
broccoli again, only this time, every time the fruit fly eats the broccoli, we're going to
trigger a big bright red light.

And when the channels see that red light, they're going to open up, and they're going to
cause that neuron to fire, and the sweet taste message will be sent to the brain. How do
you get them out? SB: So we're going to be using a mouth aspirator, so it's just two straws
put together. GG: So it's a fancy name for a straw. SB: Basically. GG: So you're going to
suck those out. Have you ever sucked up a fly before? SB: Once or twice. GG: There we go.
You got all four. OK, perfect. So you're going to turn on your OptoStimmers here. You're
going to park the light right on top of the chambers. So now we sit here and we wait for
them to eat broccoli, and then when the light fires, they're going to think it's tasting
something sweet. Come on. Oh, he's getting closer. Come on. It tastes good now. SB: It's
about to. GG: Oh, he's back. All right! All right, so now we see that some of these flies
are switching over from the banana to the broccoli. SB: Exactly, yeah. GG: Every time this
light goes off, that means that they think they're tasting something sweet. SB:
Yeah.

So this guy's really going after it. GG: So we saw that we were able to rescue broccoli and
make it just as appealing as banana to our fruit flies. And we're able to replicate these
same results in all of our experiments. So the question is: Can we do the same thing in
humans? Well, that depends on a number of items. First, do optogenetic tools even work in
humans? And that looks like the answer is yes, and in fact, clinical trials are already
being planned that will treat chronic pain and blindness using optogenetics. And the next
question is, can we easily trigger a light source so that every time we eat vegetables, it
will go off? For that, I'm afraid at least at this time, the answer is still no. But
today, we got to witness just a taste of optogenetics and its amazing potential.
