title: The lovable (and lethal) sea lion
speaker: Claire Simeone
description: >-
 Sunning themselves on rocks or waddling awkwardly across the beach, it's easy to
 think of sea lions more as sea house cats. But don't be fooled by their beachside
 behavior. Under the waves, sea lions are incredible endurance hunters, reaching
 speeds of 18 miles an hour and hunting for up to 30 hours at a time. Claire
 Simeone dives into what makes these majestic mammals such resourceful foragers.

Sunning themselves on rocks or waddling awkwardly across the beach, it’s easy to think of
these immobile mammals less as sea lions, and more as sea house cats. But don’t be fooled
by their beachside behavior. Under the waves, sea lions are incredible endurance
hunters. Hurtling around at speeds from 4 to 18 miles an hour and hunting for up to 30
hours at a time, these majestic mammals live up to their name. And thanks to a suite of 
physical adaptations, finely tuned over millions of years, they make for resourceful
foragers. To find their favorite food, sea lions hunt much deeper than many of their
semi-aquatic peers. With some species diving to depths of nearly 400 meters, they’re able
to cope with the mounting pressure by collapsing their pliable rib cage, and compressing
a pair of springy lungs. This pushes air up through the smaller airways, collapsing rings
of cartilage as oxygen travels out from the lungs, to be held in the larger, upper
airways.

Upon surfacing, this air will be used to re-inflate the lungs, but for now their heart
slows down to preserve oxygen. Blood flow is redirected towards only the most essential
organs like the heart, lungs, and brain, which rely on reserve oxygen stored in blood and
muscle. Once they arrive at their hunting ground, sea lions depend on their superior 
vision to find their prey. Most mammal eyes have a structure called a lens– a
transparent, convex structure whose shape refracts light to enable sight. In humans, this
lens is curved to process light waves traveling through air. But sea lions need to see
their best at hundreds of meters deep. To accommodate, their eyes have a much rounder
lens to refract light underwater, as well as teardrop-shaped pupils which can expand to 25
times their original size. This lets in as much light as possible, helping them pinpoint
their prey in even the dimmest conditions. But once they’ve closed in, they rely on
something akin to a sixth sense to actually catch their meal.

Their whiskers, or vibrissae, are composed of keratin and full of nerve fibers that run
deep into the connective tissue of their face. Sea lions have full directional control 
over these whiskers, which can lie flat against their face, or stick out at a 90-degree
angle. When properly tuned, these whiskers can sense the slim trails of moving water fish
leave in their wake. And they’re precise enough to let blindfolded sea lions tell the
difference between objects less than two centimeters different in size. With these tools a
healthy sea lion can catch generous helpings of fish such as anchovy, mackerel, and squid
on every outing. And with their exceptional memories, they can remember multiple hunting
grounds, including those they haven’t visited in decades. This memory also extends to
breeding territories and birthing areas, as well as which neighbors are friend and foe.
There’s even evidence that sea lions can remember how to perform tasks after 10 years
with no practice in between, letting them navigate old stomping grounds with ease. Yet
despite these incredible adaptations, there are changes unfolding in their habitats too
rapidly for sea lions to handle.

As climate change warms the oceans, certain toxic algae species thrive. This algae is
harmless to the fish who eat it, but for the sea lions which ingest those fish, the
algae’s domoic acid can trigger seizures and brain damage. Changing ocean conditions keep
 this algae blooming year round, causing more and more sea lions to wash up on
beaches. This tragic discovery is just one of the many ways the health of aquatic animal 
communities can help us better understand Earth’s oceans. These red flags help us take
action to protect ourselves and other maritime mammals. And the more we can learn about
the changing ocean that sea lions inhabit, the better equipped we’ll be to help these
clever creatures thrive.
