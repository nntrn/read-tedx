title: A path to higher education and employment for refugees
speaker: Chrystina Russell
description: >-
 Out of the more than 70 million displaced people worldwide, only three percent
 have access to higher education. The Global Education Movement (GEM) is on a
 mission to change that with the first large-scale initiative of its kind to help
 refugee learners get bachelor's degrees and create pathways toward employment.
 Hear from students and the program's executive director, Chrystina Russell, about
 how GEM's flexible, competency-based model sets graduates up for success and
 empowerment wherever they are.

Saida Aden Said: I still have this horrific image in my mind. I could see people falling
down, gunshots. I was so terrified. Really, I was crying a lot. Someone who knew my father
and my mom grabbed my hand, and he said, "Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!" And I was like,
"Where's my mom? My mom? My mom?"Noria Dambrine Dusabireme: During nights we would hear
shots, we would hear guns. Elections were supposed to happen. We had young people going in
the street, they were having strikes. And most of the young people died. SAS: We boarded a
vehicle. It was overloaded. People were running for their lives. That is how I fled from
Somalia. My mom missed me. Nobody told her where I went. NDD: The fact that we did not go
to school, we couldn't go to the market, we were just stuck home made me realize that if I
got an option to go for something better, I could just go for it and have a better
future.

Ignazio Matteini: Globally, displaced people in the world have been increasing. Now there
are almost 60 million people displaced in the world. And unfortunately, it doesn't
stop. Chrystina Russell: I think the humanitarian community is starting to realize from
research and reality that we're talking about a much more permanent problem. Baylie Damtie
Yeshita: These students, they need a tertiary education, a degree that they can use. If
the students are living now in Rwanda, if they get relocated, still they can continue
their study. Still, their degree is useful, wherever they are. CR: Our audacious project
was to really test Southern New Hampshire University's Global Education Movement's ability
to scale, to bring bachelor's degrees and pathways to employment to refugees and those who
would otherwise not have access to higher education. SAS: It was almost impossible, as a
refugee person, to further my education and to make my career. My name is Saida Aden Said,
and I am from Somalia.

I was nine years old when I came to Kakuma, and I started going to school at 17. Now I am
doing my bachelor degree with SNHU.NDD: My name is Noria Dambrine Dusabireme. I'm doing my
bachelor of arts in communications with a concentration in business. CR: We are serving
students across five different countries: Lebanon, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda and South Africa.
Really proud to have 800 AA grads to over 400 bachelor's graduates and nearly 1,000
students enrolled right now. So, the magic of this is that we're addressing refugee lives
as they exist. There are no classes. There are no lectures. There are no due dates. There
are no final exams. This degree is competency-based and not time-bound. You choose when
you start your project. You choose how you're going to approach it. NDD: When you open the
platform, that's where you can see the goals. Under each goal, we can find projects. When
you open a project, you get the competencies that you have to master, directions and
overview of the project. CR: The secret sauce of SNHU is combining that competency-based
online learning with the in-person learning that we do with partners to provide all the
wraparound supports.

That includes academic coaching. It means psychosocial support, medical support, and it's
also that back-end employment support that's really resulting in the 95 percent
graduation, the 88 percent employment. NDD: I'm a social media management intern. It's
related to the communications degree I'm doing. I've learned so many things out of the
project and in the real world. CR: The structured internship is really an opportunity for
students to practice their skills, for us to create connections between that internship
and a later job opportunity.

This is a model that really stops putting time and university policies and procedures at
the center and instead puts the student at the center. IM: The SNHU model is a big way to
shake the tree. Huge. It's a huge shake to the traditional way of having tertiary
education here. BDY: It can transform the lives of students from these vulnerable and
refugee communities. NDD: If I get the degree, I can just come back and work everywhere
that I want. I can go for a masters confidently in English, which is something that I
would not have dreamt of before. And I have the confidence and the skills required to
actually go out and just tackle the workplace without having to fear that I can't make
it. SAS: I always wanted to work with the community. I want to establish a nonprofit. We
advocate for women's education. I want to be someone who is, like, an ambassador and
encourage them to learn and tell them it is never too late.

It's a dream.
