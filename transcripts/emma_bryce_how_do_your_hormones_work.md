Over the course of our lifetimes, our bodies undergo a series of extraordinary
metamorphoses: we grow, experience puberty, and many of us reproduce. Behind the scenes,
the endocrine system works constantly to orchestrate these changes. Alongside growth and
sexual maturity, this system regulates everything from your sleep to the rhythm of your
beating heart, exerting its influence over each and every one of your cells. The endocrine
system relies on interactions between three features to do its job: glands, hormones, and
trillions of cell receptors. Firstly, there are several hormone-producing glands: three in
your brain, and seven in the rest of your body. Each is surrounded by a network of blood
vessels, from which they extract ingredients to manufacture dozens of hormones. Those
hormones are then pumped out in tiny amounts, usually into the bloodstream. From there,
each hormone needs to locate a set of target cells in order to bring about a specific
change.

To find its targets, it’s helped along by receptors, which are special proteins inside 
or on the cell’s surface. Those receptors recognise specific hormones as they waft by, and
bind to them. When this happens, that hormone-receptor combination triggers a range of
effects that either increase or decrease specific processes inside the cell to change the
way that cell behaves. By exposing millions of cells at a time to hormones in
carefully-regulated quantities, the endocrine system drives large-scale changes across
the body. Take, for instance, the thyroid and the two hormones it produces,
triiodothyronine and thyroxine. These hormones travel to most of the body’s cells, where
they influence how quickly those cells use energy and how rapidly they work. In turn,
that regulates everything from breathing rate to heartbeat, body temperature, and
digestion. Hormones also have some of their most visible—and familiar—effects during
puberty.

In men, puberty begins when the testes start secreting testosterone. That triggers the
gradual development of the sexual organs, makes facial hair sprout, and causes the voice
to deepen and height to increase. In women, estrogen secreted from the ovaries signals the
start of adulthood. It helps the body develop, makes the hips widen, and thickens the
womb’s lining, preparing the body for menstruation or pregnancy. An enduring misconception
around the endocrine system is that there are exclusively male and female hormones. In
fact, men and women have estrogen and testosterone, just in different amounts. Both
hormones play a role in pregnancy, as well, alongside more than 10 other hormones that
ensure the growth of the fetus, enable birth, and help the mother feed her child. Such
periods of hormonal change are also associated with fluctuations in mood. That’s because
hormones can influence the production of certain chemicals in the brain, like
serotonin.

When chemical levels shift, they may cause changes in mood, as well. But that’s not to say
that hormones have unlimited power over us. They’re frequently viewed as the main drivers
of our behavior, making us slaves to their effects, especially during puberty. But
research shows that our behavior is collectively shaped by a variety of influences,
including the brain and its neurotransmitters, our hormones, and various social factors.
The primary function of the endocrine system is to regulate our bodily processes, not
control us. Sometimes disease, stress, and even diet can disrupt that regulatory function,
however, altering the quantity of hormones that glands secrete or changing the way that
cells respond. Diabetes is one of the most common hormonal disorders, occurring when the
pancreas secretes too little insulin, a hormone that manages blood sugar levels. And
hypo- and hyperthyroidism occur when the thyroid gland makes too little or too much
thyroid hormone.

When there’s too little thyroid hormone, that results in a slowed heart rate, fatigue, and
depression, and when there’s too much thyroid hormone, weight loss, sleeplessness, and
irritability. But most of the time, the endocrine system manages to keep our bodies in a
state of balance. And through its constant regulation, it drives the changes that
ultimately help us become who we are.
