Corn currently accounts for more than one tenth of our global crop production. The United
States alone has enough cornfields to cover Germany. But while other crops we grow come
in a range of varieties, over 99% of cultivated corn is the exact same type: Yellow Dent
#2. This means that humans grow more Yellow Dent #2 than any other plant on the planet.
So how did this single variety of this single plant become the biggest success story in
agricultural history? Nearly 9,000 years ago, corn, also called maize, was first
domesticated from teosinte, a grass native to Mesoamerica. Teosinte’s rock-hard seeds 
were barely edible, but its fibrous husk could be turned into a versatile material. Over
the next 4,700 years, farmers bred the plant into a staple crop, with larger cobs and
edible kernels. As maize spread throughout the Americas, it took on an important role,
with multiple indigenous societies revering a “Corn Mother” as the goddess who created
agriculture. When Europeans first arrived in America, they shunned the strange
plant.

Many even believed it was the source of physical and cultural differences between them
and the Mesoamericans. However, their attempts to cultivate European crops in American
soil quickly failed, and the settlers were forced to expand their diet. Finding the crop
to their taste, maize soon crossed the Atlantic, where its ability to grow in diverse 
climates made it a popular grain in many European countries. But the newly established
United States was still the corn capital of the world. In the early 1800’s, different
regions across the country produced strains of varying size and taste. In the 1850’s,
however, these unique varieties proved difficult for train operators to package, and for
traders to sell. Trade boards in rail hubs like Chicago encouraged corn farmers to breed
one standardized crop. This dream would finally be realized at 1893’s World’s Fair, where
James Reid’s yellow dent corn won the Blue Ribbon. Over the next 50 years, yellow dent 
corn swept the nation.

Following the technological developments of World War II, mechanized harvesters became 
widely available. This meant a batch of corn that previously took a full day to harvest by
hand could now be collected in just 5 minutes. Another wartime technology, the chemical 
explosive ammonium nitrate, also found new life on the farm. With this new synthetic
fertilizer, farmers could plant dense fields of corn year after year, without the need to
rotate their crops and restore nitrogen to the soil. While these advances made corn an 
attractive crop to American farmers, US agricultural policy limited the amount farmers
could grow to ensure high sale prices. But in 1972, President Richard Nixon removed these
limitations while negotiating massive grain sales to the Soviet Union. With this new
trade deal and WWII technology, corn production exploded into a global phenomenon. These
mountains of maize inspired numerous corn concoctions.

Cornstarch could be used as a thickening agent for everything from gasoline to glue or
processed into a low-cost sweetener known as High-Fructose Corn Syrup. Maize quickly
became one of the cheapest animal feeds worldwide. This allowed for inexpensive meat
production, which in turn increased the demand for meat and corn feed. Today, humans eat
only 40% of all cultivated corn, while the remaining 60% supports consumer good
industries worldwide. Yet the spread of this wonder-crop has come at a price. Global water
sources are polluted by excess ammonium nitrate from cornfields. Corn accounts for a
large portion of agriculture-related carbon emissions, partly due to the increased meat 
production it enables. The use of high fructose corn syrup may be a contributor to
diabetes and obesity. And the rise of monoculture farming has left our food supply
dangerously vulnerable to pests and pathogens— a single virus could infect the world’s 
supply of this ubiquitous crop.

Corn has gone from a bushy grass to an essential element of the world’s industries. But
only time will tell if it has led us into a maze of unsustainability.
