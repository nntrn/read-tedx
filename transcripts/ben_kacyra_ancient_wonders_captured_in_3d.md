title: Ancient wonders captured in 3D
speaker: Ben Kacyra
description: >-
 Ancient monuments give us clues to astonishing past civilizations -- but they're
 under threat from pollution, war, neglect. Ben Kacyra, who invented a groundbreaking
 3D scanning system, is using his invention to scan and preserve the world's
 heritage in archival detail. (Watch to the end for a little demo.)

I'd like to start with a short story. It's about a little boy whose father was a history
buff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ruins of an ancient metropolis on
the outskirts of their camp. They would always stop by to visit these huge winged bulls
that used to guard the gates of that ancient metropolis, and the boy used to be scared of
these winged bulls, but at the same time they excited him. And the dad used to use those
bulls to tell the boy stories about that civilization and their work. Let's fast-forward to
the San Francisco Bay Area many decades later, where I started a technology company that
brought the world its first 3D laser scanning system. Let me show you how it works. Female
Voice: Long range laser scanning by sending out a pulse that's a laser beam of light. The
system measures the beam's time of flight, recording the time it takes for the light to
hit a surface and make its return.

With two mirrors, the scanner calculates the beam's horizontal and vertical angles, giving
accurate x, y, and z coordinates. The point is then recorded into a 3D visualization
program. All of this happens in seconds. Ben Kacyra: You can see here, these systems are
extremely fast. They collect millions of points at a time with very high accuracy and very
high resolution. A surveyor with traditional survey tools would be hard-pressed to produce
maybe 500 points in a whole day. These babies would be producing something like ten
thousand points a second. So, as you can imagine, this was a paradigm shift in the survey
and construction as well as in reality capture industry. Approximately ten years ago, my
wife and I started a foundation to do good, and right about that time, the magnificent
Bamiyan Buddhas, hundred and eighty foot tall in Afghanistan, were blown up by the
Taliban. They were gone in an instant. And unfortunately, there was no detailed
documentation of these Buddhas.

This clearly devastated me, and I couldn't help but wonder about the fate of my old
friends, the winged bulls, and the fate of the many, many heritage sites all over the
world. Both my wife and I were so touched by this that we decided to expand the mission of
our foundation to include digital heritage preservation of world sites. We called the
project CyArk, which stands for Cyber Archive. To date, with the help of a global network
of partners, we've completed close to fifty projects. Let me show you some of them:
Chichen Itza, Rapa Nui — and what you're seeing here are the cloud of points — Babylon,
Rosslyn Chapel, Pompeii, and our latest project, Mt. Rushmore, which happened to be one of
our most challenging projects. As you see here, we had to develop a special rig to bring
the scanner up close and personal. The results of our work in the field are used to
produce media and deliverables to be used by conservators and researchers.

We also produce media for dissemination to the public — free through the CyArk website.
These would be used for education, cultural tourism, etc. What you're looking at in here is
a 3D viewer that we developed that would allow the display and manipulation of [the] cloud
of points in real time, cutting sections through them and extracting dimensions. This
happens to be the cloud of points for Tikal. In here you see a traditional 2D
architectural engineering drawing that's used for preservation, and of course we tell the
stories through fly-throughs. And here, this is a fly-through the cloud of points of
Tikal, and here you see it rendered and photo-textured with the photography that we take
of the site. And so this is not a video. This is actual 3D points with two to three
millimeter accuracy. And of course the data can be used to develop 3D models that are very
accurate and very detailed. And here you're looking at a model that's extracted from the
cloud of points for Stirling Castle.

It's used for studies, for visualization, as well as for education. And finally, we produce
mobile apps that include narrated virtual tools. The more I got involved in the heritage
field, the more it became clear to me that we are losing the sites and the stories faster
than we can physically preserve them. Of course, earthquakes and all the natural phenomena
— floods, tornadoes, etc. — take their toll. However, what occurred to me was human-caused
destruction, which was not only causing a significant portion of the destruction, but
actually it was accelerating. This includes arson, urban sprawl, acid rain, not to mention
terrorism and wars. It was getting more and more apparent that we're fighting a losing
battle. We're losing our sites and the stories, and basically we're losing a piece — and a
significant piece — of our collective memory. Imagine us as a human race not knowing where
we came from. Luckily, in the last two or three decades, digital technologies have been
developing that have helped us to develop tools that we've brought to bear in the digital
preservation, in our digital preservation war.

This includes, for example, the 3D laser scanning systems, ever more powerful personal
computers, 3D graphics, high-definition digital photography, not to mention the Internet.
Because of this accelerated pace of destruction, it became clear to us that we needed to
challenge ourselves and our partners to accelerate our work. And we created a project we
call the CyArk 500 Challenge — and that is to digitally preserve 500 World Heritage Sites
in five years. We do have the technology that's scaleable, and our network of global
partners has been expanding and can be expanded at a rapid rate, so we're comfortable that
this task can be accomplished. However, to me, the 500 is really just the first 500. In
order to sustain our work into the future, we use technology centers where we partner with
local universities and colleges to take the technology to them, whereby they then can help
us with digital preservation of their heritage sites, and at the same time, it gives them
the technology to benefit from in the future. Let me close with another short
story.

Two years ago, we were approached by a partner of ours to digitally preserve an important
heritage site, a UNESCO heritage site in Uganda, the Royal Kasubi Tombs. The work was done
successfully in the field, and the data was archived and publicly disseminated through the
CyArk website. Last March, we received very sad news. The Royal Tombs had been destroyed
by suspected arson. A few days later, we received a call: "Is the data available and can
it be used for reconstruction?" Our answer, of course, was yes. Let me leave you with a
final thought. Our heritage is much more than our collective memory — it's our collective
treasure. We owe it to our children, our grandchildren and the generations we will never
meet to keep it safe and to pass it along. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Well, I'm staying here because we wanted to demonstrate to
you the power of this technology and so, while I've been speaking, you have been scanned.

The two wizards that I have that are behind the curtain will help me bring the results on
the screen. 

This is all in 3D and of course you can fly through the cloud of points. You can look at
it from on top, from the ceiling. You can look from different vantage points, but I'm
going to ask Doug to zoom in on an individual in the crowd, just to show the amount of
detail that we can create. So you have been digitally preserved in about four minutes.

I'd like to thank the wizards here. We were very lucky to have two of our partners
participate in this: the Historic Scotland, and the Glasgow School of Art. I'd like to
also thank personally the efforts of David Mitchell, who is the Director of Conservation
at Historic Scotland. David. 

And Doug Pritchard, who's the Head of Visualization at the Glasgow School of Art. Let's
give them a hand.

Thank you.
