title: The story of Marvel's first queer Latina superhero
speaker: Gabby Rivera
description: >-
 With Marvel's "America Chavez," Gabby Rivera wrote a new kind of superhero -- one
 who can punch portals into other dimensions while also embracing her gentle,
 goofy, soft side. In a funny, personal talk, Rivera shares how her own childhood
 as a queer Puerto Rican in the Bronx informed this new narrative -- and shows
 images from the comic book that reveal what happens when a superhero embraces her
 humanity. As she says: "That myth of having to go it alone and be tough is not
 serving us."

At no point did I think superheroes would become such a huge part of my life. As a kid, I
looked at them, and I saw everything I wasn't. They had big muscles, supermodel good
looks, and phenomenal cosmic powers. And me? I kind of looked like this, except shorter
and with frizzier hair, and I never felt powerful. I was always just one big ball of
nervous, soft energy, and superheroes, much like the bullies at school, didn't seem to
have a lot of room for that, for me. So I stayed away. And besides, who needs superheroes
when you're surrounded by Puerto Rican women from the Bronx?

My tías were cops and paramedics, my abuelas were seamstresses and sold jewelry up the
street, and my mom got her master's degree in education and taught kindergarten in New
York City public schools for over 30 years. So my superheroes were sitting around the
dinner table with me. And I don't know how much time you've spent with Puerto Rican women
from the Bronx, but we're also some of the world's greatest storytellers. And I'd sit
there at my grandmother's dining room table and I'd listen to the women in my family tell
these wild, rambunctious tales about navigating their lives in the Bronx. And I wanted to
be them so bad. But I wasn't tough like them either. So mostly, I listened, and I soaked
it in, and I found myself gravitating to the soft threads in their stories, and I wrote
those down. The funny, the goofy, the gentle — those were my in to storytelling, so much
so that I wrote a young-adult novel called "Juliet Takes a Breath," about a chubby, queer
Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx navigating sexuality, family and identity.

And on the strength of "Juliet," Marvel Comics tapped me to write the solo series for
their first-ever Latina lesbian superhero, America Chavez. Yeah!

Listen, OK. Created by Joe Casey and Nick Dragotta for the Marvel miniseries "Vengeance,"
America Chavez has been in the Marvel Universe for over seven years. She's tough, Latina,
and she's so strong that she can punch portals into other dimensions.

I know, right?

And people were so excited, because finally, someone who shared her identities — queer and
Latina — would be writing her story. And I saw that, right? And also, when I looked at
America, I saw a young Latina in survival mode. See, because her moms had sacrificed
themselves to the universe when she was a kid, and she'd been on her own ever since. No
wonder she had to be tough. And that link, that link of having to be tough, that rested
heavy with me. Like I said, I'm from the Bronx, and the Bronx is tough, tough like walking
past sidewalk memorials and dodging cop towers on your way to the train type of tough.
When stuff happens that's bad, people are like, "Yo, you gotta keep it moving. You gotta
keep trucking. Don't cry. Don't let it get to you." And my mom and my tías and my abuelas,
I never saw them take a moment to rest or to invest in self-care. And their soft? It never
left the house. And so that was the first thing that I wanted to give to America, the thing
that I wished I'd been able to give to my abuelas and my tías, the thing that I'm trying
to give to my mom now: permission to be soft.

Like, it's OK to sit in silence and go on a journey just to discover yourself, and your
pain will make you crumble and you will fall and you will need to ask people for help, and
that's OK, and that being vulnerable is good for us. But see, I didn't come to all this
compassion and healing stuff like, you know, out of nowhere, and so when it came to
America's story, I wanted to give her the space to be human, to mess up, and to find soft
on her own. So she kind of had to quit her day job. You know what I'm saying? I had to give
her a superhero sabbatical,

and the first thing I did was enroll her in Justice Sonia Sotomayor University.

Because where else would she feel safe and represented and liberated but a university
dedicated to the first Puerto Rican woman nominated to the Supreme Court of the United
States? And her first class is "Intergalactic Revolutionaries and You," and America is so
excited, she's ready to show off her strength, she's ready to show off her portal-punching
skills,

and I stripped that safety net from her right away. And I limited her powers, and I
changed up her location and shook up her world, because that is what college is
like,

especially if you're alone. But I didn't want America to be alone for long, and so in a
homework assignment gone totally wrong, she lands on a battlefield with the
X-Men.

Because, when I was in college, the Reverend Kelly Brown Douglas was my mentor, and I knew
that America Chavez needed one, too. And who better to mentor America Chavez than Storm,
the first black female superhero and one of the most powerful members of the X-Men?
Nobody, that's who.

And Storm teaches America how to quiet her mind inside of a star portal, and when America
quiets her mind, she opens up the dimensions, and in that silence, she can listen for
anything and anyone. And no one has ever offered her silence and deep reflection as a way
to be powerful. And at first, she rejects it, but with Storm's encouragement, it clicks,
and America quiets the world around her, and she leans into a deep vulnerability. I mean,
her and Storm even hug. I know. And that's because my mentors loved me enough to encourage
me to investigate myself and my ancestors, and when you're 19, how do you even know what
that means? I didn't learn about the history of my people in college. I learned about the
history of my people sitting on my grandmother's lap when she pulled out the photo album
and she named everyone that was here and everyone still left on the island. So obviously, I
had to crash-land a grandma on America Chavez, and not just any grandma — a big, strong,
luchador grandma, one that loved her enough to take her to the ancestral plain, where
America Chavez could see the history of her people play out in the skies above. And America
gets to see Planeta Fuertona, the birth planet of her grandmother, and she sees it get
invaded, and she sees her grandmother and her mom flee.

And she also sees the joy that they experience when their new homeland accepts them openly
and offers them tremendous care. She gets to see great pain met with even greater
compassion, and that's right alongside the tremendous strength of her family. And so
everywhere that I could, right, I wrote her little love notes for her and for all the
other queer kids of color trying to be magnificent. Like, when you lose yourself, dig deep
into your ancestry, because you will find the pieces there. And also, reminders that soft
is not a pass to duck, to hide, to be silent, to cower. Soft is also a push to hold
ourselves accountable. Kind of like when America lands in World War II and comes
face-to-face with Hitler, and she knocks him the hell out ...

just like Captain America did in 1941, and who knew we'd need America Chavez to punch
Nazis in 2018.

And even that, that justified act kind of wrecks her a little bit, so I made sure that she
linked up with her best friend, and they talk feelings and they go on a road trip and they
sing "Just a Girl" by No Doubt at the top of their lungs.

And when Midas, a sinister corporation, takes control of Sotomayor, threatens to ban
portals and almost kills America ... her ancestors reach for her ... because they know
that she needs to heal. And it is that burst of care, that healing, that gives her the
fuel to defeat Midas and reclaim herself. See, because that myth of having to go it alone
and having to be tough ... doesn't serve us. America Chavez is a whole superhero, and she
still needed a team of support to help her find herself. And she needed that gentleness,
the type of gentleness that is rooted in compassion and still very much invested in
justice and liberation. Because it's in that space where softness and vulnerability meet
strength that we transcend our everyday selves, that we become something greater,
something majestic, maybe even something super. Thank you.
