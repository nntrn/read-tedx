If you had caught me straight out of college in the halls of the Vermont State House where
I was a lobbyist in training and asked me what I was going to do with my life, I would
have told you that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi, the Chinese equivalency
exam, and I was going to go study law in Beijing, and I was going to improve U.S.-China
relations through top-down policy changes and judicial system reforms.

I had a plan, and I never ever thought it would have anything to do with the banjo. Little
did I know what a huge impact it would have on me one night when I was at a party and I
heard a sound coming out of a record player in the corner of a room. And it was Doc Watson
singing and playing "Shady Grove." ♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫ ♫ Shady Grove, my
darlin' ♫ ♫ Shady Grove, my little love ♫ ♫ Going back to Harlan ♫ That sound was just so
beautiful, the sound of Doc's voice and the rippling groove of the banjo. And after being
totally and completely obsessed with the mammoth richness and history of Chinese culture,
it was like this total relief to hear something so truly American and so truly awesome. I
knew I had to take a banjo with me to China. So before going to law school in China I
bought a banjo, I threw it in my little red truck and I traveled down through Appalachia
and I learned a bunch of old American songs, and I ended up in Kentucky at the
International Bluegrass Music Association Convention.

And I was sitting in a hallway one night and a couple girls came up to me. And they said,
"Hey, do you want to jam?" And I was like, "Sure." So I picked up my banjo and I nervously
played four songs that I actually knew with them. And a record executive walked up to me
and invited me to Nashville, Tennessee to make a record.

It's been eight years, and I can tell you that I didn't go to China to become a lawyer. In
fact, I went to Nashville. And after a few months I was writing songs. And the first song
I wrote was in English, and the second one was in Chinese.

[Chinese]Outside your door the world is waiting. Inside your heart a voice is calling. The
four corners of the world are watching, so travel daughter, travel. Go get it,
girl.

It's really been eight years since that fated night in Kentucky. And I've played thousands
of shows. And I've collaborated with so many incredible, inspirational musicians around
the world. And I see the power of music. I see the power of music to connect cultures. I
see it when I stand on a stage in a bluegrass festival in east Virginia and I look out at
the sea of lawn chairs and I bust out into a song in Chinese. [Chinese] And everybody's
eyes just pop wide open like it's going to fall out of their heads. And they're like,
"What's that girl doing?" And then they come up to me after the show and they all have a
story. They all come up and they're like, "You know, my aunt's sister's babysitter's dog's
chicken went to China and adopted a girl." And I tell you what, it like everybody's got a
story. It's just incredible. And then I go to China and I stand on a stage at a university
and I bust out into a song in Chinese and everybody sings along and they roar with delight
at this girl with the hair and the instrument, and she's singing their music. And I see,
even more importantly, the power of music to connect hearts.

Like the time I was in Sichuan Province and I was singing for kids in relocation schools
in the earthquake disaster zone. And this little girl comes up to me. [Chinese] "Big
sister Wong," Washburn, Wong, same difference. "Big sister Wong, can I sing you a song
that my mom sang for me before she was swallowed in the earthquake?" And I sat down, she
sat on my lap. She started singing her song. And the warmth of her body and the tears
rolling down her rosy cheeks, and I started to cry. And the light that shone off of her
eyes was a place I could have stayed forever. And in that moment, we weren't our American
selves, we weren't our Chinese selves, we were just mortals sitting together in that light
that keeps us here. I want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone. And I know
U.S.-China relations doesn't need another lawyer. Thank you.
