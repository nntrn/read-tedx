title: In on a secret? That's dramatic irony
speaker: Christopher Warner
description: >-
 You're in a movie theater, watching the new horror flick. The audience knows
 something that the main character does not. The audience sees the character's
 actions are not in his best interest. What's that feeling -- the one that makes
 you want to shout at the screen? Christopher Warner identifies this storytelling
 device as dramatic irony. [Directed by Ben Pearce, narrated by Christopher
 Warner].

What do horror movies and comedies have in common? The two genres might seem totally
different, but the reason they're both so popular is perhaps because what they have in
common: their use of dramatic irony. First, let's clarify. There are three types of irony
out there. Situational irony is when you expect one thing, but get the opposite. Verbal
irony is when someone says something, but truly means the opposite. Dramatic irony,
though, is what we will be looking at right now. Dramatic irony is when the audience seems
to know more about an event, a situation, or a conversation than the characters in the
movie, on the show, or in the book do. The audience is in on a secret that the characters
have missed. This is a great story-telling device that creates tremendous emotion within
that text. Think about it for a moment. How does it feel when, in a horror film, you know
that the scary villain is hiding behind that door in the darkened room.

The music becomes eerie, the lighting creates complete shadows, this has to be bad for the
hero! Of course, though, that hero must enter the room to find the villain. You feel
tremendous tension and the suspense of knowing that someone will jump out and be scary,
but you just don't know when. That tension is dramatic irony: you know something more than
the characters in the film. Now, take the typical comedy. There will probably be some type
of "misunderstanding". Again, we know more of what is going on than the characters do.
Picture two characters making a plan for a birthday surprise for their roommate while that
roommate overhears the entire conversation from the hallway. From there, confusion and
misunderstanding occur, and the tension builds. This isn't the same tension as the horror
film since it is probably pretty funny as the character tries to figure out the whos and
the whats, but it serves as a great example of the tension and suspense of dramatic
irony.

This tension or suspense in both genres drives the story and keeps the plot progressing.
The audience wants, no, needs, to see the tension of the dramatic irony broken either by
the scary person jumping out of the shadows or by someone finally revealing someone's true
identity and clearing up the confusion. So, when you feel like you are in on a secret,
that is dramatic irony, a hallmark of all the great writers, from Shakespeare to
Hitchcock.
