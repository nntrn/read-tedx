I am going to start with a challenge. I want you to imagine each of these two scenes in as
much detail as you can. Scene number one: "They gave us a hearty welcome." Well, who are
the people who are giving a hearty welcome? What are they wearing? What are they drinking?
OK, scene two: "They gave us a cordial reception." How are these people standing? What
expressions are on their faces? What are they wearing and drinking? Fix these pictures in
your mind's eye and then jot down a sentence or two to describe them. We'll come back to
them later. Now on to our story. In the year 400 C.E. the Celts in Britain were ruled by
Romans. This had one benefit for the Celts: the Romans protected them from the barbarian
Saxon tribes of Northern Europe. But then the Roman Empire began to crumble, and the
Romans withdrew from Britain. With the Romans gone, the Germanic tribes, the Angles,
Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians quickly sailed across the water, did away with the Celts, and
formed kingdoms in the British Isles.

For several centuries, these tribes lived in Britain, and their Germanic language, Anglo
Saxon, became the common language, what we call Old English. Although modern English
speakers may think Old English sounds like a different language, if you look and listen
closely, you'll find many words that are recognizable. For example, here is what the
Lord's Prayer looks like in Old English. At first glance, it may look unfamiliar, but
update the spelling a bit, and you'll see many common English words. So the centuries
passed with Britains happily speaking Old English, but in the 700's, a series of Viking
invasions began, which continued until a treaty split the island in half. On one side were
the Saxons. On the other side were the Danes who spoke a language called Old Norse. As
Saxons fell in love with their cute Danish neighbors and marriages blurred the boundaries,
Old Norse mixed with Old English, and many Old Norse words like freckle, leg, root, skin,
and want are still a part of our language.

300 years later, in 1066, the Norman conquest brought war again to the British Isles. The
Normans were Vikings who settled in France. They had abandoned the Viking language and
culture in favor of a French lifestyle, but they still fought like Vikings. They placed a
Norman king on the English throne and for three centuries, French was the language of the
British royalty. Society in Britain came to have two levels: French-speaking aristocracy
and Old English-speaking peasants. The French also brought many Roman Catholic clergymen
with them who added Latin words to the mix. Old English adapted and grew as thousands of
words flowed in, many having to do with government, law, and aristocracy. Words like
council, marriage, sovereign, govern, damage, and parliament. As the language expanded,
English speakers quickly realized what to do if they wanted to sound sophisticated: they
would use words that had come from French or Latin.

Anglo Saxon words seemed so plain like the Anglo Saxon peasants who spoke them. Let's go
back to the two sentences you thought about earlier. When you pictured the hearty welcome,
did you see an earthy scene with relatives hugging and talking loudly? Were they drinking
beer? Were they wearing lumberjack shirts and jeans? And what about the cordial reception?
I bet you pictured a far more classy and refined crowd. Blazers and skirts, wine and
caviar. Why is this? How is it that phrases that are considered just about synonymous by
the dictionary can evoke such different pictures and feelings? "Hearty" and "welcome" are
both Saxon words. "Cordial" and "reception" come from French. The connotation of nobility
and authority has persisted around words of French origin. And the connotation of
peasantry, real people, salt of the Earth, has persisted around Saxon words. Even if you
never heard this history before, the memory of it persists in the feelings evoked by the
words you speak.

On some level, it's a story you already knew because whether we realize it consciously or
only subconsciously, our history lives in the words we speak and hear.
