title: A cyber-magic card trick like no other
speaker: Marco Tempest
description: >-
 The suits, numbers and colors in a deck of cards correspond to the seasons, moon
 cycles and calendar. Marco Tempest straps on augmented reality goggles and does a
 card trick like you've never seen before, weaving a lyrical tale as he deals.
 (This version fixes a glitch in the original performance, but is otherwise
 exactly as seen live by the TEDGlobal audience, including the dazzling augmented
 reality effects.)

Good morning. So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve, to make
possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow. As a cyber-magician, I combine
elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be
experienced. You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass. It's new technology. You
look through them and the world you see is augmented with data: names of places,
monuments, buildings, maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the
street. So these are my illusion glasses. They're a little bigger. They're a prototype.
And when you look through them, you get a glimpse into the mind of the
cyber-illusionist. Let me show you what I mean. All we need is a playing card. Any card
will do. Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again. All
right. Very significant mark. And let's put it back into the deck, somewhere in the
middle, and let's get started.

Voice: System ready. Acquiring image. Marco Tempest: For those of you who don't play cards,
a deck of cards is made up of four different suits: hearts, clubs, diamonds and spades.
The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols, and have been interpreted in many different
ways. Now, some say that the four suits represent the four seasons. There's spring,
summer, autumn and âVoice: My favorite season is winter. MT: Well yeah, mine too. Winter
is like magic. It's a time of change, when warmth turns to cold, water turns to snow, and
then it all disappears. There are 13 cards in each suit. 

Voice: Each card represents a phase of the 13 lunar cycles. MT: So over here is low tide,
and over here is high tide, and in the middle is the moon. Voice: The moon is one of the
most potent symbols of magic. MT: There are two colors in a deck of cards. There is the
color red and the color black, representing the constant change from day to night. Voice:
Marco, I did not know you could do that. 

MT: And is it a coincidence that there are 52 cards in a deck of cards, just as there are
52 weeks in a year?

Voice: If you total all the spots on a deck of cards, the result is 365.MT: Oh, 365, the
number of days in a year, the number of days between each birthday. Make a wish. (Blowing
noise)Voice: Don't tell, or it won't come true. MT: Well, as a matter of fact, it was on my
sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards, and ever since that day, I have
traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls, men and women, husbands and
wives, even kings and queens. 

Voice: And who are these? MT: Ah, mischief-makers. Watch. Wake up. Joker: Whoa. MT: Are you
ready for your party piece? Joker: Ready!MT: Let me see what you've got. Joker: Presenting
my pogo stick. MT: Ah. Watch out. Joker: Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh! 

MT: But today, I am performing for a different kind of audience. I'm performing for
you. Voice: Signed card detected. MT: Well, sometimes people ask me how do you become a
magician? Is it a 9-to-5 job? Of course not! You've got to practice 24/7. I don't
literally mean 24 hours, seven days a week. 24/7 is a little bit of an exaggeration, but
it does take practice. Now, some people will say, well, magic, that must be the work of
some evil supernatural force. 

Whoa. Well, to this, I just say, no no. Actually, in German, it's nein nein.

Magic isn't that intense. I have to warn you, though, if you ever play with someone who
deals cards like this, don't play for money.

Voice: Why not? That's a very good hand. The odds of getting it are 4,165 to one. MT: Yeah,
but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds. Voice: I think you got your birthday
wish. MT: And that actually leaves me with the last, and most important card of all: the
one with this very significant mark on it. And unlike anything else we've just seen,
virtual or not. Voice: Signed card detected. Digital MT: This is without a question the real
thing. MT: Bye bye. 

Thank you. 

Thank you very much.
