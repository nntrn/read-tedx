title: How do dogs "see" with their noses?
speaker: Alexandra Horowitz
description: >-
 You may have heard the expression that dogs 'see with their noses.' But these
 creature's amazing nasal architecture actually reveals a whole world beyond what
 we can see. Alexandra Horowitz illustrates how the dog's nose can smell the past,
 the future and even things that can't be seen at all. [Directed by Prov√≠ncia
 Studio, narrated by Pen-Pen Chen].

"Hi, Bob." "Morning, Kelly. The tulips looks great." Have you ever wondered how your dog
experiences the world? Here's what she sees. Not terribly interesting. But what she
smells, that's a totally different story. And it begins at her wonderfully developed
nose. As your dog catches the first hints of fresh air, her nose's moist, spongy outside
helps capture any scents the breeze carries. The ability to smell separately with each
nostril, smelling in stereo, helps to determine the direction of the smell's source so
that within the first few moments of sniffing, the dog starts to become aware of not just
what kind of things are out there but also where they're located. As air enters the nose,
a small fold of tissue divides it into two separate folds, one for breathing and one
just for smelling. This second airflow enters a region filled with highly specialized 
olfactory receptor cells, several hundred millions of them, compaired to our five
million.

And unlike our clumsy way of breathing in and out through the same passage, dogs exhale
through slits at the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help draw in new
odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up over mulitple sniffs. But all that
impressive nasal architecture wouldn't be much help without something to process the loads
of information the nose scoops up. And it turns out that the olfactory system dedicated to
proessing smells takes up many times more relative brain area in dogs than in humans. All
of this allows dogs to distinguish and remember a staggering variety of specific scents
at concentrations up to 100 million times less than what our noses can detect. If you can
smell a spritz of perfume in a small room, a dog would have no trouble smelling it in an
enclosed stadium and distinguishing its ingredients, to boot. And everything in the
street, every passing person or car, any contents of the neighbor's trash, each type of
tree, and all the birds and insects in it has a distinct odor profile telling your dog
what it is, where it is, and which direction it's moving in.

Besides being much more powerful than ours, a dog's sense of smell can pick up things
that can't even be seen at all. A whole separate olfactory system, called the vomeronasal
organ, above the roof of the mouth, detects the hormones all animals, Including humans,
naturally release. It lets dogs identify potential mates, or distinguish between friendly 
and hostile animals. It alerts them to our various emotional states, and it can even tell
them when someone is pregnant or sick. Because olfaction is more primal than other
senses, bypassing the thalamus to connect directly to the brain structures involving
emotion and instinct, we might even say a dog's perception is more immediate and visceral
than ours. But the most amazing thing about your dog's nose is that it can traverse time.
The past appears in tracks left by passersby, and by the warmth of a recently parked car
where the residue of where you've been and what you've done recently.

Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees are aromatic bulletin boards carrying messages of
who's been by, what they've been eating, and how they're feeling. And the future is in the
breeze, alerting them to something or someone approaching long before you see them. Where
we see and hear something at a single moment, a dog smells an entire story from start to
finish. In some of the best examples of canine-human collaboration, dogs help us by
sharing and reacting to those stories. They can respond with kindness to people in
distress, or with aggression to threats because stress and anger manifest as a cloud of
hormones recognizable to the dog's nose. With the proper training, they can even alert us 
to invisible threats ranging from bombs to cancer. As it turns out, humanity's best friend
is not one who experiences the same things we do, but one whose incredible nose reveals 
a whole other world beyond our eyes.
