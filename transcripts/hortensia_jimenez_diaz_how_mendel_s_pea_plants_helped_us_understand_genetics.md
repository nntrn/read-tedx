title: How Mendel's pea plants helped us understand genetics
speaker: Hortensia Jiménez Díaz
description: >-
 Each father and mother pass down traits to their children, who inherit combinations
 of their dominant or recessive alleles. But how do we know so much about genetics
 today? Hortensia Jiménez Díaz explains how studying pea plants revealed why you
 may have blue eyes. [Directed by Johan Sonestedt and Veronica Wallenberg,
 narrated by Rose Eveleth].

These days scientists know how you inherit characteristics from your parents. They're able
to calculate probabilities of having a specific trait or getting a genetic disease
according to the information from the parents and the family history. But how is this
possible? To understand how traits pass from one living being to its descendants, we need
to go back in time to the 19th century and a man named Gregor Mendel. Mendel was an
Austrian monk and biologist who loved to work with plants. By breeding the pea plants he
was growing in the monastery's garden, he discovered the principles that rule heredity. In
one of most classic examples, Mendel combined a purebred yellow-seeded plant with a
purebred green-seeded plant, and he got only yellow seeds. He called the yellow-colored
trait the dominant one, because it was expressed in all the new seeds. Then he let the new
yellow-seeded hybrid plants self-fertilize.

And in this second generation, he got both yellow and green seeds, which meant the green
trait had been hidden by the dominant yellow. He called this hidden trait the recessive
trait. From those results, Mendel inferred that each trait depends on a pair of factors,
one of them coming from the mother and the other from the father. Now we know that these
factors are called alleles and represent the different variations of a gene. Depending on
which type of allele Mendel found in each seed, we can have what we call a homozygous pea,
where both alleles are identical, and what we call a heterozygous pea, when the two
alleles are different. This combination of alleles is known as genotype and its result,
being yellow or green, is called phenotype. To clearly visualize how alleles are
distributed amongst descendants, we can a diagram called the Punnett square. You place the
different alleles on both axes and then figure out the possible combinations. Let's look
at Mendel's peas, for example.

Let's write the dominant yellow allele as an uppercase "Y" and the recessive green allele
as a lowercase "y." The uppercase Y always overpowers his lowercase friend, so the only
time you get green babies is if you have lowercase Y's. In Mendel's first generation, the
yellow homozygous pea mom will give each pea kid a yellow-dominant allele, and the green
homozygous pea dad will give a green-recessive allele. So all the pea kids will be yellow
heterozygous. Then, in the second generation, where the two heterozygous kids marry, their
babies could have any of the three possible genotypes, showing the two possible phenotypes
in a three-to-one proportion. But even peas have a lot of characteristics. For example,
besides being yellow or green, peas may be round or wrinkled. So we could have all these
possible combinations: round yellow peas, round green peas, wrinkled yellow peas, wrinkled
green peas.

To calculate the proportions for each genotype and phenotype, we can use a Punnett square
too. Of course, this will make it a little more complex. And lots of things are more
complicated than peas, like, say, people. These days, scientists know a lot more about
genetics and heredity. And there are many other ways in which some characteristics are
inherited. But, it all started with Mendel and his peas.
