(Music by Anna Oxygen)(Music: "Shells" by Mirah)♪ You learned how to be a diver ♪♪ Put on
a mask and believe ♪♪ Gather a dinner of shells for me ♪♪ Take the tank down so you can
breathe ♪♪ Below ♪♪ Movements slow ♪♪ You are an island ♪♪ All the secrets until then ♪♪
Pried open I held them ♪♪ Until they were still ♪♪ Until they were still ♪♪ Until they
were still ♪

(Music by Caroline Lufkin)(Music by Anna Oxygen)♪ Dream time, I will find you ♪♪ You are
shady, you are new ♪♪ I'm not so good at mornings ♪♪ I can see too clearly ♪♪ I prefer
the nighttime ♪♪ Dark and blurry ♪♪ Falling night ♪♪ Hovering light ♪♪ Calling night ♪♪
Hovering light ♪♪ In the moontime I will give up my life ♪ ♪ And in the deep dreams ♪♪ You
will find me ♪
