title: Enough with the fear of fat
speaker: Kelli Jean Drinkwater
description: >-
 In a society obsessed with body image and marked by a fear of fat, Kelli Jean
 Drinkwater engages in radical body politics through art. She confronts the
 public's perception of bigger bodies by bringing them into spaces that were once
 off limits -- from fashion runways to the Sydney Festival -- and entices all of
 us to look again and rethink our biases. "Unapologetic fat bodies can blow
 people's minds," she says.

I'm here today to talk to you about a very powerful little word, one that people will do
almost anything to avoid becoming. Billion-dollar industries thrive because of the fear of
it, and those of us who undeniably are it are left to navigate a relentless storm
surrounding it. I'm not sure if any of you have noticed, but I'm fat. Not the lowercase,
muttered-behind-my-back kind, or the seemingly harmless chubby or cuddly. I'm not even the
more sophisticated voluptuous or curvaceous kind. Let's not sugarcoat it. I am the capital
F-A-T kind of fat. I am the elephant in the room. When I walked out on stage, some of you
may have been thinking, "Aww, this is going to be hilarious, because everybody knows that
fat people are funny."

Or you may have been thinking, "Where does she get her confidence from?" Because a
confident fat woman is almost unthinkable. The fashion-conscious members of the audience
may have been thinking how fabulous I look in this Beth Ditto dress —

thank you very much. Whereas some of you might have thought, "Hmm, black would have been
so much more slimming."

You may have wondered, consciously or not, if I have diabetes, or a partner, or if I eat
carbs after 7pm.

You may have worried that you ate carbs after 7pm last night, and that you really should
renew your gym membership. These judgments are insidious. They can be directed at
individuals and groups, and they can also be directed at ourselves. And this way of
thinking is known as fatphobia. Like any form of systematic oppression, fatphobia is deeply
rooted in complex structures like capitalism, patriarchy and racism, and that can make it
really difficult to see, let alone challenge. We live in a culture where being fat is seen
as being a bad person — lazy, greedy, unhealthy, irresponsible and morally suspect. And we
tend to see thinness as being universally good — responsible, successful, and in control
of our appetites, bodies and lives. We see these ideas again and again in the media, in
public health policy, doctors' offices, in everyday conversations and in our own
attitudes. We may even blame fat people themselves for the discrimination they face
because, after all, if we don't like it, we should just lose weight.

Easy. This antifat bias has become so integral, so ingrained to how we value ourselves and
each other that we rarely question why we have such contempt for people of size and where
that disdain comes from. But we must question it, because the enormous value we place on
how we look affects every one of us. And do we really want to live in a society where
people are denied their basic humanity if they don't subscribe to some arbitrary form of
acceptable? So when I was six years old, my sister used to teach ballet to a bunch of
little girls in our garage. I was about a foot taller and a foot wider than most of the
group. When it came to doing our first performance, I was so excited about wearing a
pretty pink tutu. I was going to sparkle. As the other girls slipped easily into their
Lycra and tulle creations, not one of the tutus was big enough to fit me. I was determined
not to be excluded from the performance, so I turned to my mother and loud enough for
everyone to hear said, "Mom, I don't need a tutu.

I need a fourfour."

Thanks, Mom.

And although I didn't recognize it at the time, claiming space for myself in that glorious
fourfour was the first step towards becoming a radical fat activist. Now, I'm not saying
that this whole body-love thing has been an easy skip along a glittering path of
self-acceptance since that day in class. Far from it. I soon learned that living outside
what the mainstream considers normal can be a frustrating and isolating place. I've spent
the last 20 years unpacking and deprogramming these messages, and it's been quite the
roller coaster. I've been openly laughed at, abused from passing cars and been told that
I'm delusional. I also receive smiles from strangers who recognize what it takes to walk
down the street with a spring in your step and your head held high.

Thanks. And through it all, that fierce little six-year-old has stayed with me, and she
has helped me stand before you today as an unapologetic fat person, a person that simply
refuses to subscribe to the dominant narrative about how I should move through the world
in this body of mine.

And I'm not alone. I am part of an international community of people who choose to, rather
than passively accepting that our bodies are and probably always will be big, we actively
choose to flourish in these bodies as they are today. People who honor our strength and
work with, not against, our perceived limitations, people who value health as something
much more holistic than a number on an outdated BMI chart. Instead, we value mental
health, self-worth and how we feel in our bodies as vital aspects to our overall
well-being. People who refuse to believe that living in these fat bodies is a barrier to
anything, really. There are doctors, academics and bloggers who have written countless
volumes on the many facets of this complex subject. There are fatshionistas who reclaim
their bodies and their beauty by wearing fatkinis and crop tops, exposing the flesh that
we're all taught to hide. There are fat athletes who run marathons, teach yoga or do
kickboxing, all done with a middle finger firmly held up to the status
quo.

And these people have taught me that radical body politics is the antidote to our
body-shaming culture. But to be clear, I'm not saying that people shouldn't change their
bodies if that's what they want to do. Reclaiming yourself can be one of the most gorgeous
acts of self-love and can look like a million different things, from hairstyles to tattoos
to body contouring to hormones to surgery and yes, even weight loss. It's simple: it's
your body, and you decide what's best to do with it. My way of engaging in activism is by
doing all the things that we fatties aren't supposed to do, and there's a lot of them,
inviting other people to join me and then making art about it. The common thread through
most of this work has been reclaiming spaces that are often prohibitive to bigger bodies,
from the catwalk to club shows, from public swimming pools to prominent dance stages. And
reclaiming spaces en masse is not only a powerful artistic statement but a radical
community-building approach.

This was so true of "AQUAPORKO!" —

the fat fem synchronized swim team I started with a group of friends in Sydney. The impact
of seeing a bunch of defiant fat women in flowery swimming caps and bathers throwing their
legs in the air without a care should not be underestimated.

Throughout my career, I have learned that fat bodies are inherently political, and
unapologetic fat bodies can blow people's minds. When director Kate Champion, of acclaimed
dance theater company Force Majeure, asked me to be the artistic associate on a work
featuring all fat dancers, I literally jumped at the opportunity. And I mean literally.
"Nothing to Lose" is a work made in collaboration with performers of size who drew from
their lived experiences to create a work as varied and authentic as we all are. And it was
as far from ballet as you could imagine. The very idea of a fat dance work by such a
prestigious company was, to put it mildly, controversial, because nothing like it had ever
been done on mainstream dance stages before anywhere in the world. People were skeptical.
"What do you mean, 'fat dancers?' Like, size 10, size 12 kind of fat? Where did they do
their dance training? Are they going to have the stamina for a full-length production?"But
despite the skepticism, "Nothing to Lose" became a sellout hit of Sydney
Festival.

We received rave reviews, toured, won awards and were written about in over 27 languages.
These incredible images of our cast were seen worldwide. I've lost count of how many times
people of all sizes have told me that the show has changed their lives, how it helped them
shift their relationship to their own and other people's bodies, and how it made them
confront their own bias. But of course, work that pushes people's buttons is not without
its detractors. I have been told that I'm glorifying obesity. I have received violent
death threats and abuse for daring to make work that centers fat people's bodies and lives
and treats us as worthwhile human beings with valuable stories to tell. I've even been
called "the ISIS of the obesity epidemic" —

a comment so absurd that it is funny. But it also speaks to the panic, the literal terror,
that the fear of fat can evoke. It is this fear that's feeding the diet industry, which is
keeping so many of us from making peace with our own bodies, for waiting to be the
after-photo before we truly start to live our lives. Because the real elephant in the room
here is fatphobia. Fat activism refuses to indulge this fear. By advocating for
self-determination and respect for all of us, we can shift society's reluctance to embrace
diversity and start to celebrate the myriad ways there are to have a body. Thank
you.
