title: A warrior’s cry against child marriage
speaker: Memory Banda
description: >-
 Memory Banda’s life took a divergent path from her sister’s. When her sister
 reached puberty, she was sent to a traditional “initiation camp” that teaches
 girls “how to sexually please a man.” She got pregnant there — at age 11. Banda,
 however, refused to go. Instead, she organized others and asked her community’s
 leader to issue a bylaw that no girl should be forced to marry before turning 18.
 She pushed on to the national level … with incredible results for girls across
 Malawi.

I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi, Eileen Piri. Eileen
is only 13 years old, but when we were going through the collection of poetry that we
wrote, I found her poem so interesting, so motivating. So I'll read it to you. She
entitled her poem "I'll Marry When I Want." 

"I'll marry when I want. My mother can't force me to marry. My father cannot force me to
marry. My uncle, my aunt, my brother or sister, cannot force me to marry. No one in the
world can force me to marry. I'll marry when I want. Even if you beat me, even if you
chase me away, even if you do anything bad to me, I'll marry when I want. I'll marry when I
want, but not before I am well educated, and not before I am all grown up. I'll marry when
I want."This poem might seem odd, written by a 13-year-old girl, but where I and Eileen
come from, this poem, which I have just read to you, is a warrior's cry. I am from Malawi.
Malawi is one of the poorest countries, very poor, where gender equality is
questionable. Growing up in that country, I couldn't make my own choices in life. I
couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two
different girls, two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were
eating the same food.

Sometimes, they would share clothes, and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently,
in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only 11
years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her, even me.
I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture, once you reach puberty
stage, you are supposed to go to initiation camps. In these initiation camps, you are
taught how to sexually please a man. There is this special day, which they call "Very
Special Day" where a man who is hired by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with
the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most
girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted
diseases. For my little sister, she ended up being pregnant. Today, she's only 16 years old
and she has three children.

Her first marriage did not survive, nor did her second marriage. On the other side, there
is this girl. She's amazing. 

I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me.

When I was 13 years old, I was told, you are grown up, you have now reached of age, you're
supposed to go to the initiation camp. I was like, "What? I'm not going to go to the
initiation camps." You know what the women said to me? "You are a stupid girl. Stubborn.
You do not respect the traditions of our society, of our community."I said no because I
knew where I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young
girl. I wanted to get well educated, to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining
myself as a lawyer, seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were
going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day, I would contribute something, a
little something to my community. But every day after refusing, women would tell me, "Look
at you, you're all grown up. Your little sister has a baby. What about you?" That was the
music that I was hearing every day, and that is the music that girls hear every day when
they don't do something that the community needs them to do. When I compared the two
stories between me and my sister, I said, "Why can't I do something?

Why can't I change something that has happened for a long time in our community?"That was
when I called other girls just like my sister, who have children, who have been in class
but they have forgotten how to read and write. I said, "Come on, we can remind each other
how to read and write again, how to hold the pen, how to read, to hold the book." It was a
great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them, but they were able
to tell me their personal stories, what they were facing every day as young mothers. That
was when I was like, 'Why can't we take all these things that are happening to us and
present them and tell our mothers, our traditional leaders, that these are the wrong
things?" It was a scary thing to do, because these traditional leaders, they are already
accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change, but a
good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard, but we pushed.

And I'm here to say that in my community, it was the first community after girls pushed
so hard to our traditional leader, and our leader stood up for us and said no girl has to
be married before the age of 18. 

In my community, that was the first time a community, they had to call the bylaws, the
first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead.
We were determined to fight for girls not just in my community, but even in other
communities. When the child marriage bill was being presented in February, we were there
at the Parliament house. Every day, when the members of Parliament were entering, we were
telling them, "Would you please support the bill?" And we don't have much technology like
here, but we have our small phones. So we said, "Why can't we get their numbers and text
them?" So we did that. It was a good thing. 

So when the bill passed, we texted them back, "Thank you for supporting the bill."

And when the bill was signed by the president, making it into law, it was a plus. Now, in
Malawi, 18 is the legal marriage age, from 15 to 18. 

It's a good thing to know that the bill passed, but let me tell you this: There are
countries where 18 is the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries of women and girls
every day? Every day, girls' lives are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders to
honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment, it means keeping girls' issues at
heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that
women, as we are in this room, we are not just women, we are not just girls, we are
extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other
countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law until it is enforced?
The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries have been
there, they need to be publicized at the local level, at the community level, where girls'
issues are very striking. Girls face issues, difficult issues, at the community level
every day.

So if these young girls know that there are laws that protect them, they will be able to
stand up and defend themselves because they will know that there is a law that protects
them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful,
they are there, but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates, they have to jump in, to step
in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need:
good education, and above all, not to marry whilst 11.And furthermore, I know that
together, we can transform the legal, the cultural and political framework that denies
girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can end child
marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl, and millions of
girls worldwide, will be able to say, "I will marry when I want."

Thank you.
