"Till death do us part." When we get married, we make vows. To love, to honor, to forsake
all others. Or as a friend of mine put it, "Not to leave dirty socks all over the
house."

We may fall short of some of our promises some of the time, but one that will always hold
true is that first one: "Till death do us part." Because spouses are bound together by
their decisions, in marriage and in divorce. So, a mentor of mine once told me, "You should
always marry your second husband first."

What did that mean? It didn't mean that Mr. Right is somehow waiting behind door number
two. It meant that if you want to understand what makes a marriage work, you should think
about how a marriage ends. Divorce makes extremely explicit what the tacit rules of
marriage are. And everyone should understand those rules, because doing so can help us
build better marriages from the beginning. I know, it doesn't sound very romantic, but
sometimes the things we do out of love can be the very things that make it hard for that
love to last. I am a family-law professor. I have taught students, I've been an attorney,
I'm a mediator and I've also been divorced. And I'm now happily married to my actual
second husband.

The reason that I think this is so important is that I think everyone should be having
some of these very painful conversations that divorced people experience. These are
painful conversations about what we contributed, what we owe, what we are willing to give
and what we give up. And also, what's important to us. Those conversations should be
happening in a good marriage, not after it is broken. Because when you wait until it's
broken, it's too late. But if you have them early on, they can actually help build a
better marriage. Three ideas that I want to put on the table for you to consider. One,
sacrifice should be thought of as a fair exchange. Two, there's no such thing as free
childcare. And three, what's yours probably becomes ours. So let me talk about each of
these ideas. The first one, sacrifice should be a fair exchange. Take the example of Lisa
and Andy. Lisa decides to go to medical school early in the marriage, and Andy works to
support them.

And Andy works night shifts in order to do that, and he also gives up a great job in
another city. He does this out of love. But of course, he also understands that Lisa's
degree will benefit them both in the end. But after a few years, Andy becomes neglected
and resentful. And he starts drinking heavily. And Lisa looks at her life and she looks at
Andy and she thinks, "This is not the bargain I wanted to make." A couple of years go by,
she graduates from medical school, and she files for a divorce. So in my perfect world,
some kind of marriage mediator would have been able to talk to them before Lisa went to
medical school. And at that point, that mediator might have asked, "How exactly does fair
exchange work? What does it look like in your marriage? What are you willing to give and
what are you willing to owe?" So in a divorce, Lisa now probably is going to owe Andy
financial support for years. And Andy ...

no amount of financial support is going to make him feel compensated for what he gave up,
and the lost traction in his career. If the two of them had thought about their split early
on, what might have gone differently? Well, it's possible that Lisa would have decided
that she would take loans or work a part-time job in order to support her own tuition so
that Andy wouldn't have had to bear the entire burden for that. And Andy might have
decided to take that job in that other city and maybe the two of them would have commuted
for a couple of years while Lisa finished her degree. So let's take another couple, Emily
and Deb. They live in a big city, they have two children, they both work. Emily gets a job
in a small town, and they decide to move there together. And Deb quits her job to look
after the children full-time. Deb leaves behind an extended family, her friends and a job
that she really liked. And in that small town, Deb starts to feel isolated and
lonely.

And 10 years later, Deb has an affair, and things fall apart. Now, the marriage mediator
who would have come in before they moved and before Deb quit her job might have asked
them, "What do your choices about childcare do to the obligations you have to each other?
How do they affect your relationship? Because you have to remember that there is no such
thing as free childcare."If the two of them had thought about their split beforehand, what
would have gone differently? Well, maybe Deb would have realized a little better how much
her family and her friends were important to her precisely in what she was taking on,
which is full-time parenthood. Perhaps Emily, in weighing the excitement of the new job
offer might have also thought about what that would mean for the cost to Deb and what
would be owed to Deb as a result of her taking on full-time parenthood. So, let's go back
to Lisa and Andy. Lisa had an inheritance from her grandmother before the
marriage.

And when they got married, they bought a home, and Lisa put that inheritance toward a down
payment on that home. And then Andy of course worked to make the mortgage payments. And
all of their premarital and marital property became joined. That inheritance is now
marital property. So, in a split, what's going to happen? They're going to have to sell
the house and split the proceeds, or one of them can buy the other out. So this marriage
mediator, if they had talked to them before all of this happened, that person would have
asked, "What do you want to keep separate and what do you want to keep together? And how
does that choice actually support the security of the marriage? Because you have to
remember that what's yours, probably, will become ours, unless you actually are mindful
and take steps to do otherwise."So if they had thought about their split, maybe they would
have decided differently, maybe Lisa would have thought, "Maybe the inheritance can stay
separate," and saved for a day when they might actually need it.

And maybe the mortgage that they took on wouldn't have been as onerous, and maybe Andy
wouldn't have had to work so hard to make those payments. And maybe he would have become
less resentful. Maybe they would have lived in a smaller house and been content to do
that. The point is, if they had had a divorce-conscious discussion about what to keep
separate, their marriage might have been more connected and more together. Too often in
marriage, we make sacrifices, and we demand them, without reckoning their cost. But there
is wisdom in looking at the price tags attached to our marital decisions in just the way
that divorce law teaches us to do. What I want is for people to think about their marital
bargains through the lens of divorce. And to ask, "How is marriage a sacrifice, but an
exchange of sacrifice? How do we think about our exchange?" Second: "How do we think about
childcare and deal with the fact that there is no such thing as free childcare?" "How do
we deal with the fact that some things can be separate and some things can be together,
and if we don't think about it, then it will all be part of the joint enterprise."So
basically, what I want to leave you with is that in marriage or divorce, people should
think about the way that "till death do us part" marriage is forever. Thank
you.
