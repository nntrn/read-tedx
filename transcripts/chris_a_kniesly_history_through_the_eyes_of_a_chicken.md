The annals of Ancient Egyptian king Thutmose III described a marvelous foreign bird that
“gives birth daily.” Zoroastrians viewed them as spirits whose cries told of the cosmic
struggle between darkness and light. Romans brought them on their military campaigns to
foretell the success of future battles. And today, this bird still occupies an important,
though much less honorable position – on our dinner plates. The modern chicken is descended
primarily from the Red Junglefowl, and partially from three other closely related
species, all native to India and Southeast Asia. The region’s bamboo plants produce
massive amounts of fruit just once every few decades. Junglefowls’ ability to lay eggs
daily may have evolved to take advantage of these rare feasts, increasing their
population when food was abundant. This was something humans could exploit on a consistent
basis, and the birds’ weak flight capabilities and limited need for space made them easy
to capture and contain. The earliest domesticated chickens, dating at least back to 7,000
years ago, weren’t bred for food, but for something considered less savory
today.

The aggressiveness of breeding males, armed with natural leg spurs, made cockfighting a
popular entertainment. By the second millennium BCE, chickens had spread from the Indus
Valley to China and the Middle East to occupy royal menageries and to be used in religious
rituals. But it was in Egypt where the next chapter in the bird’s history began. When a hen
naturally incubates eggs, she will stop laying new ones and sit on a “clutch” of 6 or more
eggs for 21 days. By the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, the Egyptians had learned to
artificially incubate chicken eggs by placing them in baskets over hot ashes. That freed
up hens to continue laying daily, and what had been a royal delicacy or religious offering
became a common meal. Around the same time as Egyptians were incubating eggs, Phoenician
merchants introduced chickens to Europe, where they quickly became an essential part of
European livestock. However, for a long time, the chicken’s revered status continued to
exist alongside its culinary one.

The Ancient Greeks used fighting roosters as inspirational examples for young soldiers.
The Romans consulted chickens as oracles. And as late as the 7th Century, the chicken was
considered a symbol for Christianity. Over the next few centuries, chickens accompanied
humans wherever they went, spreading throughout the world through trade, conquest, and
colonization. After the Opium Wars, Chinese breeds were brought to England and crossed
with local chickens. This gave rise to a phenomenon called “Hen Fever” or “The Fancy”,
with farmers all over Europe striving to breed new varieties with particular combinations
of traits. This trend also caught the attention of a certain Charles Darwin, who wondered
if a similar selective breeding process occurred in nature. Darwin would observe hundreds
of chickens while finalizing his historic work introducing the theory of Evolution. But the
chicken’s greatest contribution to science was yet to come.

In the early 20th century, a trio of British scientists conducted extensive crossbreeding
of chickens, building on Gregor Mendel’s studies of genetic inheritance. With their high
genetic diversity, many distinct traits, and only 7 months between generations, chickens
were the perfect subject. This work resulted in the famous Punnett Square, used to show
the genotypes that would result from breeding a given pairing. Since then, numerous
breeding initiatives have made chickens bigger and meatier, and allowed them to lay more
eggs than ever. Meanwhile, chicken production has shifted to an industrial, factory-like
model, with birds raised in spaces with a footprint no larger than a sheet of paper. And
while there’s been a shift towards free-range farming due to animal rights and
environmental concerns, most of the world’s more than 22 billion chickens today are
factory farmed. From gladiators and gifts to the gods, to traveling companions and
research subjects, chickens have played many roles over the centuries.

And though they may not have come before the proverbial egg, chickens’ fascinating
history tells us a great deal about our own.
