title: How tsunamis work
speaker: Alex Gendler
description: >-
 The immense swell of a tsunami can grow up to 100 feet, hitting speeds over 500
 mph -- a treacherous combination for anyone or anything in its path. Alex Gendler
 details the causes of these towering terrors and explains how scientists are
 seeking to reduce their destruction in the future. [Directed by Augenblick
 Studios, narrated by Michelle Snow].

In 479 BC, when Persian soldiers besieged the Greek city of Potidaea, the tide retreated
much farther than usual, leaving a convenient invasion route. But this wasn't a stroke of
luck. Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher than anyone had
ever seen, drowning the attackers. The Potiidaeans believed they had been saved by the
wrath of Poseidon. But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon that has
destroyed countless others: a tsunami. Although tsunamis are commonly known as tidal
waves, they're actually unrelated to the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces
of the Sun and Moon. In many ways, tsunamis are just larger versions of regular waves.
They have a trough and a crest, and consist not of moving water, but the movement of
energy through water. The difference is in where this energy comes from. For normal ocean
waves, it comes from wind. Because this only affects the surface, the waves are limited in
size and speed.

But tsunamis are caused by energy originating underwater, from a volcanic eruption, a
submarine landslide, or most commonly, an earthquake on the ocean floor caused when the
tectonic plates of the Earth's surface slip, releasing a massive amount of energy into the
water. This energy travels up to the surface, displacing water and raising it above the
normal sea level, but gravity pulls it back down, which makes the energy ripple outwards
horizontally. Thus, the tsunami is born, moving at over 500 miles per hour. When it's far
from shore, a tsunami can be barely detectable since it moves through the entire depth of
the water. But when it reaches shallow water, something called wave shoaling occurs.
Because there is less water to move through, this still massive amount of energy is
compressed. The wave's speed slows down, while its height rises to as much as 100 feet.
The word tsunami, Japanese for "harbor wave," comes from the fact that it only seems to
appear near the coast.

If the trough of a tsunami reaches shore first, the water will withdraw farther than
normal before the wave hits, which can be misleadingly dangerous. A tsunami will not only
drown people near the coast, but level buildings and trees for a mile inland or more,
especially in low-lying areas. As if that weren't enough, the water then retreats,
dragging with it the newly created debris, and anything, or anyone, unfortunate enough to
be caught in its path. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest natural
disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people throughout South Asia. So how can we
protect ourselves against this destructive force of nature? People in some areas have
attempted to stop tsunamis with sea walls, flood gates, and channels to divert the water.
But these are not always effective. In 2011, a tsunami surpassed the flood wall protecting
Japan's Fukushima Power Plant, causing a nuclear disaster in addition to claiming over
18,000 lives.

Many scientists and policy makers are instead focusing on early detection, monitoring
underwater pressure and seismic activity, and establishing global communication networks
for quickly distributing alerts. When nature is too powerful to stop, the safest course is
to get out of its way.
