title: Wisdom from great writers on every year of life
speaker: Joshua Prager
description: >-
 As different as we humans are from one another, we all age along the same great
 sequence, and the shared patterns of our lives pass into the pages of the books
 we love. In this moving talk, journalist Joshua Prager explores the stages of
 life through quotations from Norman Mailer, Joyce Carol Oates, William Trevor and
 other great writers, set to visualizations by graphic designer Milton Glaser.
 "Books tell us who we've been, who we are, who we will be, too," Prager
 says.

I'm turning 44 next month, and I have the sense that 44 is going to be a very good year, a
year of fulfillment, realization. I have that sense, not because of anything particular in
store for me, but because I read it would be a good year in a 1968 book by Norman
Mailer."He felt his own age, forty-four ..." wrote Mailer in "The Armies of the Night,"
"... felt as if he were a solid embodiment of bone, muscle, heart, mind, and sentiment to
be a man, as if he had arrived."Yes, I know Mailer wasn't writing about me. But I also
know that he was; for all of us — you, me, the subject of his book, age more or less in
step, proceed from birth along the same great sequence: through the wonders and
confinements of childhood; the emancipations and frustrations of adolescence; the
empowerments and millstones of adulthood; the recognitions and resignations of old age.
There are patterns to life, and they are shared.

As Thomas Mann wrote: "It will happen to me as to them."We don't simply live these
patterns. We record them, too. We write them down in books, where they become narratives
that we can then read and recognize. Books tell us who we've been, who we are, who we will
be, too. So they have for millennia. As James Salter wrote, "Life passes into pages if it
passes into anything."And so six years ago, a thought leapt to mind: if life passed into
pages, there were, somewhere, passages written about every age. If I could find them, I
could assemble them into a narrative. I could assemble them into a life, a long life, a
hundred-year life, the entirety of that same great sequence through which the luckiest
among us pass. I was then 37 years old, "an age of discretion," wrote William Trevor. I
was prone to meditating on time and age. An illness in the family and later an injury to
me had long made clear that growing old could not be assumed.

And besides, growing old only postponed the inevitable, time seeing through what
circumstance did not. It was all a bit disheartening. A list, though, would last. To
chronicle a life year by vulnerable year would be to clasp and to ground what was
fleeting, would be to provide myself and others a glimpse into the future, whether we made
it there or not. And when I then began to compile my list, I was quickly obsessed,
searching pages and pages for ages and ages. Here we were at every annual step through our
first hundred years. "Twenty-seven ... a time of sudden revelations," "sixty-two, ... of
subtle diminishments."I was mindful, of course, that such insights were relative. For
starters, we now live longer, and so age more slowly. Christopher Isherwood used the
phrase "the yellow leaf" to describe a man at 53, only one century after Lord Byron used
it to describe himself at 36.

I was mindful, too, that life can swing wildly and unpredictably from one year to the
next, and that people may experience the same age differently. But even so, as the list
coalesced, so, too, on the page, clear as the reflection in the mirror, did the life that
I had been living: finding at 20 that "... one is less and less sure of who one is;"
emerging at 30 from the "... wasteland of preparation into active life;" learning at 40
"... to close softly the doors to rooms [I would] not be coming back to." There I was. Of
course, there we all are. Milton Glaser, the great graphic designer whose beautiful
visualizations you see here, and who today is 85 — all those years "... a ripening and an
apotheosis," wrote Nabokov — noted to me that, like art and like color, literature helps
us to remember what we've experienced. And indeed, when I shared the list with my
grandfather, he nodded in recognition. He was then 95 and soon to die, which, wrote
Roberto Bolaño, "...

is the same as never dying." And looking back, he said to me that, yes, Proust was right
that at 22, we are sure we will not die, just as a thanatologist named Edwin Shneidman was
right that at 90, we are sure we will. It had happened to him, as to them. Now the list is
done: a hundred years. And looking back over it, I know that I am not done. I still have
my life to live, still have many more pages to pass into. And mindful of Mailer, I await
44.Thank you.
