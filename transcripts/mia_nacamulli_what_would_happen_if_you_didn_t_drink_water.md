 Water is essentially everywhere in our world, and the average human is composed
 of between 55 and 60% water. So what role does water play in our bodies, and how
 much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy? Mia Nacamulli details the
 health benefits of hydration. [Directed by Chris Bishop, narrated by Addison

Water is virtually everywhere, from soil moisture and ice caps, to the cells inside our
own bodies. Depending on factors like location, fat index, age, and sex, the average human
is between 55-60% water. At birth, human babies are even wetter. Being 75% water, they
are swimmingly similar to fish. But their water composition drops to 65% by their first
birthday. So what role does water play in our bodies, and how much do we actually need to
drink to stay healthy? The H20 in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joints,
regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord. Water isn't only in our
blood. An adult's brain and heart are almost three quarters water. That's roughly
equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana. Lungs are more similar to an apple at
83%. And even seemingly dry human bones are 31% water. If we are essentially made of
water, and surrounded by water, why do we still need to drink so much?

Well, each day we lose two to three liters through our sweat, urine, and bowel movements,
and even just from breathing. While these functions are essential to our survival, we
need to compensate for the fluid loss. Maintaining a balanced water level is essential to
avoid dehydration or over-hydration, both of which can have devastating effects on overall
health. At first detection of low water levels, sensory receptors in the brain's
hypothalamus signal the release of antidiuretic hormone. When it reached the kidneys, it
creates aquaporins, special channels that enable blood to absorb and retain more water,
leading to concentrated, dark urine. Increased dehydration can cause notable drops in
energy, mood, skin moisture, and blood pressure, as well as signs of cognitive impairment.
A dehydrated brain works harder to accomplish the same amount as a normal brain, and it
even temporarily shrinks because of its lack of water.

Over-hydration, or hyponatremia, is usually caused by overconsumption of water in a short
amount of time. Athletes are often the victims of over-hydration because of complications
 in regulating water levels in extreme physical conditions. Whereas the dehydrated brain
amps up the production of antidiuretic hormone, the over-hydrated brain slows, or even
stops, releasing it into the blood. Sodium electrolytes in the body become diluted,
causing cells to swell. In severe cases, the kidneys can't keep up with the resulting
volumes of dilute urine. Water intoxication then occurs, possibly causing headache,
vomiting, and, in rare instances, seizures or death. But that's a pretty extreme
situation. On a normal, day-to-day basis, maintaining a well-hydrated system is easy to
manage for those of us fortunate enough to have access to clean drinking water. For a
long time, conventional wisdom said that we should drink eight glasses a day. That
estimate has since been fine-tuned.

Now, the consensus is that the amount of water we need to imbibe depends largely on our
weight and environment. The recommended daily intake varies from between 2.5-3.7 liters of
water for men, and about 2-2.7 liters for women, a range that is pushed up or down if we
are healthy, active, old, or overheating. While water is the healthiest hydrator, other
beverages, even those with caffeine like coffee or tea, replenish fluids as well. And
water within food makes up about a fifth of our daily H20 intake. Fruits and vegetables
like strawberries, cucumbers, and even broccoli are over 90% water, and can supplement
liquid intake while providing valuable nutrients and fiber. Drinking well might also have
various long-term benefits. Studies have shown that optimal hydration can lower the chance
of stroke, help manage diabetes, and potentially reduce the risk of certain types of
cancer. No matter what, getting the right amount of liquid makes a world of difference in
how you'll feel, think, and function day to day.
