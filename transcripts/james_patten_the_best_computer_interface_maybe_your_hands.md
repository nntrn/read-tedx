title: The best computer interface? Maybe ... your hands
speaker: James Patten
description: >-
 "The computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression," says
 designer and TED Fellow James Patten. But right now, we interact with computers,
 mainly, by typing and tapping. In this nifty talk and demo, Patten imagines a
 more visceral, physical way to bring your thoughts and ideas to life in the
 digital world, taking the computer interface off the screen and putting it into
 your hands.

A computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression, but for the most part,
that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones. And I'd like
to tell you a story about bringing this power of the computer to move things around and
interact with us off of the screen and into the physical world in which we live. A few
years ago, I got a call from a luxury fashion store called Barneys New York, and the next
thing I knew, I was designing storefront kinetic sculptures for their window displays. This
one's called "The Chase." There are two pairs of shoes, a man's pair and a woman's pair,
and they play out this slow, tense chase around the window in which the man scoots up
behind the woman and gets in her personal space, and then she moves away. Each of the
shoes has magnets in it, and there are magnets underneath the table that move the shoes
around. My friend Andy Cavatorta was building a robotic harp for Bjork's Biophilia tour and
I wound up building the electronics and motion control software to make the harps move and
play music.

The harp has four separate pendulums, and each pendulum has 11 strings, so the harp swings
on its axis and also rotates in order to play different musical notes, and the harps are
all networked together so that they can play the right notes at the right time in the
music. I built an interactive chemistry exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in
Chicago, and this exhibit lets people use physical objects to grab chemical elements off
of the periodic table and bring them together to cause chemical reactions to happen. And
the museum noticed that people were spending a lot of time with this exhibit, and a
researcher from a science education center in Australia decided to study this exhibit and
try to figure out what was going on. And she found that the physical objects that people
were using were helping people understand how to use the exhibit, and were helping people
learn in a social way. And when you think about it, this makes a lot of sense, that using
specialized physical objects would help people use an interface more easily.

I mean, our hands and our minds are optimized to think about and interact with tangible
objects. Think about which you find easier to use, a physical keyboard or an onscreen
keyboard like on a phone? But the thing that struck me about all of these different
projects is that they really had to be built from scratch, down to the level of the
electronics and the printed circuit boards and all the mechanisms all the way up to the
software. I wanted to create something where we could move objects under computer control
and create interactions around that idea without having to go through this process of
building something from scratch every single time. So my first attempt at this was at the
MIT Media Lab with Professor Hiroshi Ishii, and we built this array of 512 different
electromagnets, and together they were able to move objects around on top of their
surface. But the problem with this was that these magnets cost over 10,000
dollars.

Although each one was pretty small, altogether they weighed so much that the table that
they were on started to sag. So I wanted to build something where you could have this kind
of interaction on any tabletop surface. So to explore this idea, I built an army of small
robots, and each of these robots has what are called omni wheels. They're these special
wheels that can move equally easily in all directions, and when you couple these robots
with a video projector, you have these physical tools for interacting with digital
information. So here's an example of what I mean. This is a video editing application
where all of the controls for manipulating the video are physical. So if we want to tweak
the color, we just enter the color mode, and then we get three different dials for
tweaking the color, or if we want to adjust the audio, then we get two different dials for
that, these physical objects.

So here the left and right channel stay in sync, but if we want to, we can override that
by grabbing both of them at the same time. So the idea is that we get the speed and
efficiency benefits of using these physical dials together with the flexibility and
versatility of a system that's designed in software. And this is a mapping application for
disaster response. So you have these physical objects that represent police, fire and
rescue, and a dispatcher can grab them and place them on the map to tell those units where
to go, and then the position of the units on the map gets synced up with the position of
those units in the real world. This is a video chat application. It's amazing how much
emotion you can convey with just a few simple movements of a physical object. With this
interface, we open up a huge array of possibilities in between traditional board games and
arcade games, where the physical possibilities of interaction make so many different
styles of play possible. But one of the areas that I'm most excited about using this
platform for is applying it to problems that are difficult for computers or people to
solve alone.

One example of those is protein folding. So here we have an interface where we have
physical handles onto a protein, and we can grab those handles and try to move the protein
and try to fold it in different ways. And if we move it in a way that doesn't really make
sense with the underlying molecular simulation, we get this physical feedback where we can
actually feel these physical handles pulling back against us. So feeling what's going on
inside a molecular simulation is a whole different level of interaction. So we're just
beginning to explore what's possible when we use software to control the movement of
objects in our environment. Maybe this is the computer of the future. There's no
touchscreen. There's no technology visible at all. But when we want to have a video chat
or play a game or lay out the slides to our next TED Talk, the objects on the table come
alive. Thank you.
