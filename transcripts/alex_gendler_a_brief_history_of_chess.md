The attacking infantry advances steadily, their elephants already having broken the
defensive line. The king tries to retreat, but enemy cavalry flanks him from the rear.
Escape is impossible. But this isn’t a real war– nor is it just a game. Over the roughly
one-and-a-half millennia of its existence, chess has been known as a tool of military
strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, and a benchmark of genius. While our earliest
records of chess are in the 7th century, legend tells that the game’s origins lie a
century earlier. Supposedly, when the youngest prince of the Gupta Empire was killed in
battle, his brother devised a way of representing the scene to their grieving mother. Set
on the 8x8 ashtapada board used for other popular pastimes, a new game emerged with two
key features: different rules for moving different types of pieces, and a single king
piece whose fate determined the outcome.

The game was originally known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions." But
with its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name and terminology–
"chess," derived from "shah," meaning king, and “checkmate” from "shah mat," or “the king
is helpless.”After the 7th century Islamic conquest of Persia, chess was introduced to
the Arab world. Transcending its role as a tactical simulation, it eventually became a
rich source of poetic imagery. Diplomats and courtiers used chess terms to describe
political power. Ruling caliphs became avid players themselves. And historian al-Mas’udi
considered the game a testament to human free will compared to games of chance. Medieval
trade along the Silk Road carried the game to East and Southeast Asia, where many local
variants developed. In China, chess pieces were placed at intersections of board squares
rather than inside them, as in the native strategy game Go.

The reign of Mongol leader Tamerlane saw an 11x10 board with safe squares called
citadels. And in Japanese shogi, captured pieces could be used by the opposing player. But
it was in Europe that chess began to take on its modern form. By 1000 AD, the game had
become part of courtly education. Chess was used as an allegory for different social
classes performing their proper roles, and the pieces were re-interpreted in their new
context. At the same time, the Church remained suspicious of games. Moralists cautioned
against devoting too much time to them, with chess even being briefly banned in
France. Yet the game proliferated, and the 15th century saw it cohering into the form we
know today. The relatively weak piece of advisor was recast as the more powerful queen–
perhaps inspired by the recent surge of strong female leaders. This change accelerated
the game’s pace, and as other rules were popularized, treatises analyzing common openings 
and endgames appeared.

Chess theory was born. With the Enlightenment era, the game moved from royal courts to
coffeehouses. Chess was now seen as an expression of creativity, encouraging bold moves
and dramatic plays. This "Romantic" style reached its peak in the Immortal Game of 1851,
where Adolf Anderssen managed a checkmate after sacrificing his queen and both rooks. But
the emergence of formal competitive play in the late 19th century meant that strategic
calculation would eventually trump dramatic flair. And with the rise of international 
competition, chess took on a new geopolitical importance. During the Cold War, the Soviet
Union devoted great resources to cultivating chess talent, dominating the championships
for the rest of the century. But the player who would truly upset Russian dominance was
not a citizen of another country but an IBM computer called Deep Blue. Chess-playing
computers had been developed for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph over Garry Kasparov in
1997 was the first time a machine had defeated a sitting champion. Today, chess software
is capable of consistently defeating the best human players.

But just like the game they’ve mastered, these machines are products of human ingenuity.
And perhaps that same ingenuity will guide us out of this apparent checkmate.
