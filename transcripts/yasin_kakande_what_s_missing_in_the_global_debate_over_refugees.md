title: What's missing in the global debate over refugees
speaker: Yasin Kakande
description: >-
 In the ongoing debate over refugees, we hear from everyone -- from politicians
 who pledge border controls to citizens who fear they'll lose their jobs --
 everyone, that is, except migrants themselves. Why are they coming? Journalist
 and TED Fellow Yasin Kakande explains what compelled him and many others to flee
 their homelands, urging a more open discussion and a new perspective. Because
 humanity's story, he reminds us, is a story of migration: "There are no
 restrictions that could ever be so rigorous to stop the wave of migration that
 has determined our human history," he says.

I am an immigrant from Uganda living in the United States while waiting for my asylum
application to go through. Migrants do not enjoy much freedom of movement in our world
today. This certainly applies to those who are desperate enough to navigate choppy and
stormy seas in boats. These are the risks my cousins from West Africa and North Africa
face while trying to cross over to Europe. Indeed, it is a rare but fortunate opportunity
for a migrant to address a gathering like this. But this also signifies what often is
missing in the global debate over refugees, migrants and immigrants, voices of the
disenfranchised. Citizens of many host countries, even those that previously welcomed
newcomers, are uneasy about the rising numbers of individuals coming into their countries.
The immediate criticism is that the newcomers upend the stability of social welfare and
employment in their countries. Uncertain and skeptical citizens look towards politicians
who are competing against each other to see who can claim the prize of the loudest voice
of populism and nationalism.

It is a contest of who is the toughest on migrants, the most willing to impose travel bans
and the most eager to propose projects in building walls. All these restrictions simply
address symptoms of the problem, not the causes. Why are they coming? Migrants can share
perspectives, if only politicians would be willing to listen. In Dubai, I chronicled
injustices and inequalities inflicted regularly on the migrant labor force. As a result,
pressures from the governments of the respective countries led to me being forced out of
my career as a journalist in the Middle East. I was deported to Uganda, where economic
deprivation puts everyone at the risk of starvation. I fled Uganda to come to the United
States in the hope of sustaining a voice for my brothers and sisters who experience a more
serious plight as migrants. My father told me he was not happy about me writing a book that
risked deportation and unemployment.

He had been diabetic for many years when I still worked in Dubai, and my salary was always
sufficient to pay for his treatments. After I was expelled, I could not afford to sustain
his treatment, and even in the last days of his life, I could not afford to take him to a
hospital. As I carried his body in my hands to lay it in the ground in June of last year,
I realized I had paid a profound price for amplifying my voice. The act of speaking up
against injustices that are multilayered is never easy, because the problems require more
than just rhetoric. So long as gold mines, oilfields and large farms in Africa continue to
be owned by foreign investors and those vital resources are shipped to the West, the
stream of African migrants will flow continuously. There are no restrictions that could
ever be so rigorous to stop the wave of migration that has determined our human
history. Before border controls can be tightened and new visa restrictions imposed,
countries that have long received migrants should engage in a more open
discussion.

That is the only practical start for reconciling, finally, a legacy of exploitation,
slavery, colonialism and imperialism, so that together, we can move forward in creating a
more just global economy in the 21st century â€” one that benefits all.
