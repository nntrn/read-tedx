In 1956, architect Frank Lloyd Wright proposed a mile-high skyscraper. It was going to be
the world’s tallest building, by a lot — five times as high as the Eiffel Tower. But many
critics laughed at the architect, arguing that people would have to wait hours for an
elevator, or worse, that the tower would collapse under its own weight. Most engineers
agreed, and despite the publicity around the proposal, the titanic tower was never
built. But today, bigger and bigger buildings are going up around the world. Firms are
even planning skyscrapers more than a kilometer tall, like the Jeddah Tower in Saudi
Arabia, three times the size of the Eiffel Tower. Very soon, Wright’s mile-high miracle 
may be a reality. So what exactly was stopping us from building these megastructures 70
years ago, and how do we build something a mile high today? In any construction project,
each story of the structure needs to be able to support the stories on top of
it.

The higher we build, the higher the gravitational pressure from the upper stories on the
lower ones. This principle has long dictated the shape of our buildings, leading ancient
architects to favor pyramids with wide foundations that support lighter upper levels. But
this solution doesn’t quite translate to a city skyline– a pyramid that tall would be
roughly one-and-a-half miles wide, tough to squeeze into a city center. Fortunately,
strong materials like concrete can avoid this impractical shape. And modern concrete
blends are reinforced with steel-fibers for strength and water-reducing polymers to
prevent cracking. The concrete in the world’s tallest tower, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, can
withstand about 8,000 tons of pressure per square meter– the weight of over 1,200 African
elephants!Of course, even if a building supports itself, it still needs support from the
ground. Without a foundation, buildings this heavy would sink, fall, or lean
over.

To prevent the roughly half a million ton tower from sinking, 192 concrete and steel
supports called piles were buried over 50 meters deep. The friction between the piles 
and the ground keeps this sizable structure standing. Besides defeating gravity, which
pushes the building down, a skyscraper also needs to overcome the blowing wind, which
pushes from the side. On average days, wind can exert up to 17 pounds of force per square
meter on a high-rise building– as heavy as a gust of bowling balls. Designing structures
to be aerodynamic, like China’s sleek Shanghai Tower, can reduce that force by up to a
quarter. And wind-bearing frames inside or outside the building can absorb the remaining
wind force, such as in Seoul’s Lotte Tower. But even after all these measures, you could
still find yourself swaying back and forth more than a meter on top floors during a
hurricane. To prevent the wind from rocking tower tops, many skyscrapers employ a
counterweight weighing hundreds of tons called a “tuned mass damper.” The Taipei 101, for
instance, has suspended a giant metal orb above the 87th floor.

When wind moves the building, this orb sways into action, absorbing the building’s kinetic
energy. As its movements trail the tower’s, hydraulic cylinders between the ball and the
building convert that kinetic energy into heat, and stabilize the swaying structure. With
all these technologies in place, our mega-structures can stay standing and stable. But
quickly traveling through buildings this large is a challenge in itself. In Wright’s age,
the fastest elevators moved a mere 22 kilometers per hour. Thankfully, today’s elevators
are much faster, traveling over 70 km per hour with future cabins potentially using 
frictionless magnetic rails for even higher speeds. And traffic management algorithms 
group riders by destination to get passengers and empty cabins where they need to
be. Skyscrapers have come a long way since Wright proposed his mile-high tower. What were
once considered impossible ideas have become architectural opportunities.

Today it may just be a matter of time until one building goes the extra
mile.
