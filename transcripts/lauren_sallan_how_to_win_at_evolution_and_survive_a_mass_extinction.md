title: How to win at evolution and survive a mass extinction
speaker: Lauren Sallan

 Congratulations! By being here, alive, you are one of history's winners -- the
 culmination of a success story four billion years in the making. The other 99
 percent of species who have ever lived on earth are dead -- killed by fire,
 flood, asteroids, ice, heat and the cold math of natural selection. How did we
 get so lucky, and will we continue to win? In this short, funny talk, paleobiologist
 and TED Fellow Lauren Sallan shares insights on how your ancestors' survival
 through mass extinction made you who you are today.

Congratulations. By being here, listening, alive, a member of a growing species, you are
one of history's greatest winners — the culmination of a success story four billion years
in the making. You are life's one percent. The losers, the 99 percent of species who have
ever lived, are dead — killed by fire, flood, asteroids, predation, starvation, ice, heat
and the cold math of natural selection. Your ancestors, back to the earliest fishes,
overcame all these challenges. You are here because of golden opportunities made possible
by mass extinction.

It's true. The same is true of your co-winners and relatives. The 34,000 kinds of fishes.
How did we all get so lucky? Will we continue to win? I am a fish paleobiologist who uses
big data — the fossil record — to study how some species win and others lose. The living
can't tell us; they know nothing but winning. So, we must speak with the dead. How do we
make dead fishes talk? Museums contain multitudes of beautiful fish fossils, but their
real beauty emerges when combined with the larger number of ugly, broken fossils, and
reduced to ones and zeros. I can trawl a 500-million-year database for evolutionary
patterns. For example, fish forms can be captured by coordinates and transformed to reveal
major pathways of change and trends through time. Here is the story of the winners and
losers of just one pivotal event I discovered using fossil data. Let's travel back 360
million years — six times as long ago as the last dinosaur — to the Devonian period; a
strange world.

Armored predators with razor-edge jaws dominated alongside huge fishes with arm bones in
their fins. Crab-like fishes scuttled across the sea floor. The few ray-fin relatives of
salmon and tuna cowered at the bottom of the food chain. The few early sharks lived
offshore in fear. Your few four-legged ancestors, the tetrapods, struggled in tropical
river plains. Ecosystems were crowded. There was no escape, no opportunity in sight. Then
the world ended.

No, it is a good thing. 96 percent of all fish species died during the Hangenberg event,
359 million years ago: an interval of fire and ice. A crowded world was disrupted and
swept away. Now, you might think that's the end of the story. The mighty fell, the meek
inherited the earth, and here we are. But winning is not that simple. The handful of
survivors came from many groups — all greatly outnumbered by their own dead. They ranged
from top predator to bottom-feeder, big to small, marine to freshwater. The extinction was
a filter. It merely leveled the playing field. What really counted was what survivors did
over the next several million years in that devastated world. The former overlords should
have had an advantage. They became even larger, storing energy, investing in their young,
spreading across the globe, feasting on fishes, keeping what had always worked, and biding
their time. Yet they merely persisted for a while, declining without innovating, becoming
living fossils.

They were too stuck in their ways and are now largely forgotten. A few of the
long-suffering ray-fins, sharks and four-legged tetrapods went the opposite direction.
They became smaller — living fast, dying young, eating little and reproducing rapidly.
They tried new foods, different homes, strange heads and weird bodies.

And they found opportunity, proliferated, and won the future for their 60,000 living
species, including you. That's why they look familiar. You know their names. Winning is not
about random events or an arms race. Rather, survivors went down alternative, evolutionary
pathways. Some found incredible success, while others became dead fish
walking.

A real scientific term.

I am now investigating how these pathways to victory and defeat repeat across time. My lab
has already compiled thousands upon thousands of dead fishes, but many more remain.
However, it is already clear that your ancestors' survival through mass extinction, and
their responses in the aftermath made you who you are today. What does this tell us for the
future? As long as a handful of species survive, life will recover. The versatile and the
lucky will not just replace what was lost, but win in new forms. It just might take
several million years. Thank you.
