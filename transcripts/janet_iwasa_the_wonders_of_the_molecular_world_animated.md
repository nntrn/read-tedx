I live in Utah, a place known for having some of the most awe-inspiring natural landscapes
on this planet. It's easy to be overwhelmed by these amazing views, and to be really
fascinated by these sometimes alien-looking formations. As a scientist, I love observing
the natural world. But as a cell biologist, I'm much more interested in understanding the
natural world at a much, much smaller scale. I'm a molecular animator, and I work with
other researchers to create visualizations of molecules that are so small, they're
essentially invisible. These molecules are smaller than the wavelength of light, which
means that we can never see them directly, even with the best light microscopes. So how do
I create visualizations of things that are so small we can't see them? Scientists, like my
collaborators, can spend their entire professional careers working to understand one
molecular process. To do this, they carry out a series of experiments that each can tell
us a small piece of the puzzle.

One kind of experiment can tell us about the protein shape, while another can tell us
about what other proteins it might interact with, and another can tell us about where it
can be found in a cell. And all of these bits of information can be used to come up with a
hypothesis, a story, essentially, of how a molecule might work. My job is to take these
ideas and turn them into an animation. This can be tricky, because it turns out that
molecules can do some pretty crazy things. But these animations can be incredibly useful
for researchers to communicate their ideas of how these molecules work. They can also
allow us to see the molecular world through their eyes. I'd like to show you some
animations, a brief tour of what I consider to be some of the natural wonders of the
molecular world. First off, this is an immune cell. These kinds of cells need to go
crawling around in our bodies in order to find invaders like pathogenic
bacteria.

This movement is powered by one of my favorite proteins called actin, which is part of
what's known as the cytoskeleton. Unlike our skeletons, actin filaments are constantly
being built and taken apart. The actin cytoskeleton plays incredibly important roles in
our cells. They allow them to change shape, to move around, to adhere to surfaces and also
to gobble up bacteria. Actin is also involved in a different kind of movement. In our
muscle cells, actin structures form these regular filaments that look kind of like fabric.
When our muscles contract, these filaments are pulled together and they go back to their
original position when our muscles relax. Other parts of the cytoskeleton, in this case
microtubules, are responsible for long-range transportation. They can be thought of as
basically cellular highways that are used to move things from one side of the cell to the
other. Unlike our roads, microtubules grow and shrink, appearing when they're needed and
disappearing when their job is done. The molecular version of semitrucks are proteins aptly
named motor proteins, that can walk along microtubules, dragging sometimes huge cargoes,
like organelles, behind them.

This particular motor protein is known as dynein, and its known to be able to work
together in groups that almost look, at least to me, like a chariot of horses. As you see,
the cell is this incredibly changing, dynamic place, where things are constantly being
built and disassembled. But some of these structures are harder to take apart than others,
though. And special forces need to be brought in in order to make sure that structures are
taken apart in a timely manner. That job is done in part by proteins like these. These
donut-shaped proteins, of which there are many types in the cell, all seem to act to rip
apart structures by basically pulling individual proteins through a central hole. When
these kinds of proteins don't work properly, the types of proteins that are supposed to
get taken apart can sometimes stick together and aggregate and that can give rise to
terrible diseases, such as Alzheimer's. And now let's take a look at the nucleus, which
houses our genome in the form of DNA.

In all of our cells, our DNA is cared for and maintained by a diverse set of proteins. DNA
is wound around proteins called histones, which enable cells to pack large amounts of DNA
into our nucleus. These machines are called chromatin remodelers, and the way they work is
that they basically scoot the DNA around these histones and they allow new pieces of DNA
to become exposed. This DNA can then be recognized by other machinery. In this case, this
large molecular machine is looking for a segment of DNA that tells it it's at the
beginning of a gene. Once it finds a segment, it basically undergoes a series of shape
changes which enables it to bring in other machinery that in turn allows a gene to get
turned on or transcribed. This has to be a very tightly regulated process, because turning
on the wrong gene at the wrong time can have disastrous consequences. Scientists are now
able to use protein machines to edit genomes. I'm sure all of you have heard of
CRISPR.

CRISPR takes advantage of a protein known as Cas9, which can be engineered to recognize
and cut a very specific sequence of DNA. In this example, two Cas9 proteins are being used
to excise a problematic piece of DNA. For example, a part of a gene that may give rise to
a disease. Cellular machinery is then used to basically glue two ends of the DNA back
together. As a molecular animator, one of my biggest challenges is visualizing uncertainty.
All of the animations I've shown to you represent hypotheses, how my collaborators think a
process works, based on the best information that they have. But for a lot of molecular
processes, we're still really at the early stages of understanding things, and there's a
lot to learn. The truth is that these invisible molecular worlds are vast and largely
unexplored. To me, these molecular landscapes are just as exciting to explore as a natural
world that's visible all around us. Thank you.
