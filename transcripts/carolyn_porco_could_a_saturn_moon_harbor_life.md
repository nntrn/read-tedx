title: Could a Saturn moon harbor life?
speaker: Carolyn Porco
description: >-
 Carolyn Porco shares exciting new findings from the Cassini spacecraft's recent
 sweep of one of Saturn's moons, Enceladus. Samples gathered from the moon's icy
 geysers hint that an ocean under its surface could harbor life.

Two years ago here at TED I reported that we had discovered at Saturn, with the Cassini
Spacecraft, an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the
small Saturnine moon Enceladus, seen here. This region seen here for the first time in the
Cassini image taken in 2005. This is the south polar region, with the famous tiger-stripe
fractures crossing the south pole. And seen just recently in late 2008, here is that
region again, now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the
onset of August and eventually winter. And I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing
discovery — this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those
fractures at the south pole, consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water
vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane. And at that time two
years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers,
and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface, but we
weren't really sure.

However, the implications of those results — of a possible environment within this moon
that could support prebiotic chemistry, and perhaps life itself — were so exciting that,
in the intervening two years, we have focused more on Enceladus. We've flown the Cassini
Spacecraft by this moon now several times, flying closer and deeper into these jets, into
the denser regions of these jets, so that now we have come away with some very precise
compositional measurements. And we have found that the organic compounds coming from this
moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported. While they're not amino acids,
we're now finding things like propane and benzene, hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde. And
the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of
salty water, which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from
pockets of liquid water, but that that liquid water is in contact with
rock.

And that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical
compounds needed to sustain life. So we are very encouraged by these results. And we are
much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon,
under the south pole, an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms.
Whether or not there are living organisms there, of course, is an entirely different
matter. And that will have to await the arrival, back at Enceladus, of the spacecrafts,
hopefully some time in the near future, specifically equipped to address that particular
question. But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the
Saturnine system, and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park, just because we
can. Thank you.
