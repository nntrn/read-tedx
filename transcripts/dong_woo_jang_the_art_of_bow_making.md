speaker: Dong Woo Jang
description: >-
 Dong Woo Jang has an unusual after school hobby. Jang, who was 15 when he gave
 the talk, tells the story of how living in the concrete jungle of Seoul inspired
 him to build the perfect bow. Watch him demo one of his beautiful hand-crafted
 archer's bows.

It is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence, and I believe
this is true, especially when I hear President Obama often talk about the Korean education
system as a benchmark of success. Well, I can tell you that, in the rigid structure and
highly competitive nature of the Korean school system, also known as pressure cooker, not
everyone can do well in that environment. While many people responded in different ways
about our education system, my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows
with pieces of wood found near my apartment building. Why bows? I'm not quite sure.
Perhaps, in the face of constant pressure, my caveman instinct of survival has connected
with the bows. If you think about it, the bow has really helped drive human survival since
prehistoric times. The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry
forest during the Joseon dynasty, where silkworms were fed with mulberry
leaves.

In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact, the government has planted
mulberry trees. The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby
the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 Olympics.
The area near these walls, which nobody bothers to pay attention to, had been left free
from major intervention, and this is where I first found my treasures. As I fell deeper
into bow making, I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood. When I went on school
field trips, family vacations, or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes, I
wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked
inside my school bag. And they would be somethings like saws, knives, sickles and axes
that I covered up with a piece of towel. I would bring the branches home, riding buses and
subways, barely holding them in my hands. And I did not bring the tools here to Long
Beach.

Airport security.

In the privacy of my room, covered in sawdust, I would saw, trim and polish wood all night
long until a bow took shape. One day, I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended
up setting the place on fire. Where? The rooftop of my apartment building, a place where
96 families call home. A customer from a department store across from my building called
911, and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned. I want to take this
opportunity to tell my mom, in the audience today: Mom, I was really sorry, and I will be
more careful with open fire from now on. My mother had to do a lot of explaining, telling
people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson. I also researched extensively on
bows around the world. In that process, I tried to combine the different bows from across
time and places to create the most effective bow. I also worked with many different types
of wood, such as maple, yew and mulberry, and did many shooting experiments in the wooded
area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before. The most effective bow for me would
be like this. One: Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the
arrow. Two: Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight, which means more power. Three:
Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage. And four: Horn used
to store energy in compression. After fixing, breaking, redesigning, mending, bending and
amending, my ideal bow began to take shape, and when it was finally done, it looked like
this.

I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own. This is a picture of
Korean traditional bows taken from a museum, and see how my bow resembles them. Thanks to
my ancestors for robbing me of my invention. 

Through bowmaking, I came in contact with part of my heritage. Learning the information
that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better
than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me. You see,
I searched far and wide, but never bothered to look close and near. From this realization,
I began to take interest in Korean history, which had never inspired me before. In the
end, the grass is often greener on my side of the fence, although we don't realize it. Now,
I am going to show you how my bow works. And let's see how this one works. This is a
bamboo bow, with 45-pound draw weights. (Noise of shooting arrow) 

A bow may function in a simple mechanism, but in order to make a good bow, a great amount
of sensitivity is required. You need to console and communicate with the wood material.
Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being, and only through
cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow. I may be an [odd] student with
unconventional interests, but I hope I am making a contribution by sharing my story with
all of you. My ideal world is a place where no one is left behind, where everyone is needed
exactly where they are, like the fibers and the tendons in a bow, a place where the strong
is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient. The bow resembles me, and I resemble the bow.
Now, I am shooting a part of myself to you. No, better yet, a part of my mind has just
been shot over to your mind. Did it strike you? Thank you.
