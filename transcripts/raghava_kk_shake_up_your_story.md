Hi everyone. I'm an artist and a dad — second time around. Thank you. And I want to share
with you my latest art project. It's a children's book for the iPad. It's a little quirky
and silly. It's called "Pop-It," And it's about the things little kids do with their
parents.

So this is about potty training — as most of you, I hope, know. You can tickle the rug.
You can make the baby poop. You can do all those fun things. You can burst bubbles. You
can draw, as everyone should. But you know, I have a problem with children's books: I think
they're full of propaganda. At least an Indian trying to get one of these American books
in Park Slope, forget it. It's not the way I was brought up. So I said, "I'm going to
counter this with my own propaganda." If you notice carefully, it's a homosexual couple
bringing up a child. You don't like it? Shake it, and you have a lesbian couple.

Shake it, and you have a heterosexual couple. You know, I don't even believe in the
concept of an ideal family. I have to tell you about my childhood. I went to this very
proper Christian school taught by nuns, fathers, brothers, sisters. Basically, I was
brought up to be a good Samaritan, and I am. And I'd go at the end of the day to a
traditional Hindu house, which was probably the only Hindu house in a predominantly
Islamic neighborhood. Basically, I celebrated every religious function. In fact, when
there was a wedding in our neighborhood, all of us would paint our houses for the wedding.
I remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became
biriani. 

We all had to fast during Ramadan. It was a very beautiful time. But I must say, I'll never
forget, when I was 13 years old, this happened. Babri Masjid — one of the most beautiful
mosques in India, built by King Babur, I think, in the 16th century — was demolished by
Hindu activists. This caused major riots in my city. And for the first time, I was
affected by this communal unrest. My little five-year-old kid neighbor comes running in,
and he says, "Rags, Rags. You know the Hindus are killing us Muslims. Be careful." I'm
like, "Dude, I'm Hindu." 

He's like, "Huh!"You know, my work is inspired by events such as this. Even in my gallery
shows, I try and revisit historic events like Babri Masjid, distill only its emotional
residue and image my own life. Imagine history being taught differently. Remember that
children's book where you shake and the sexuality of the parents change? I have another
idea. It's a children's book about Indian independence — very patriotic. But when you
shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective. Shake it again, and you get the British
perspective.

You have to separate fact from bias, right. Even my books on children have cute, fuzzy
animals. But they're playing geopolitics. They're playing out Israel-Palestine,
India-Pakistan. You know, I'm making a very important argument. And my argument [is] that
the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the
earliest stage. After all, children's books are manuals on parenting, so you better give
them children's books that teach them perspectives. And conversely, only when you teach
perspectives will a child be able to imagine and put themselves in the shoes of someone
who is different from them. I'm making an argument that art and creativity are very
essential tools in empathy. You know, I can't promise my child a life without bias — we're
all biased — but I promise to bias my child with multiple perspectives. Thank you very
much.
