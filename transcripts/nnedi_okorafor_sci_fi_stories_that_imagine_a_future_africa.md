 "My science fiction has different ancestors -- African ones," says writer Nnedi
 Okorafor. In between excerpts from her "Binti" series and her novel "Lagoon,"
 Okorafor discusses the inspiration and roots of her work -- and how she opens
 strange doors through her Afrofuturist writing.

What if an African girl from a traditional family in a part of future Africa is accepted
into the finest university in the galaxy, planets away? What if she decides to go? This is
an excerpt from my "Binti" novella trilogy:I powered up the transporter and said a silent
prayer. I had no idea what I was going to do if it didn't work. My transporter was cheap,
so even a droplet of moisture or, more likely, a grain of sand, would cause it to short.
It was faulty, and most of the time I had to restart it over and over before it worked.
"Please not now, please not now," I thought. The transporter shivered in the sand and I
held my breath. Tiny, flat and black as a prayer stone, it buzzed softly and then slowly
rose from the sand. Finally, it produced the baggage-lifting force. I grinned. Now I could
make it to the shuttle on time. I swiped otjize from my forehead with my index finger and
knelt down, then I touched the finger to the sand, grounding the sweet-smelling red clay
into it."Thank you," I whispered. It was a half-mile walk along the dark desert
road.

With the transporter working I would make it there on time. Straightening up, I paused and
shut my eyes. Now, the weight of my entire life was pressing on my shoulders. I was
defying the most traditional part of myself for the first time in my entire life. I was
leaving in the dead of night, and they had no clue. My nine siblings, all older than me
except for my younger sister and brother, would never see this coming. My parents would
never imagine I'd do such a thing in a million years. By the time they all realized what
I'd done and where I was going, I'd have left the planet. In my absence, my parents would
growl to each other that I was never to set foot in their home again. My four aunties and
two uncles who lived down the road would shout and gossip amongst themselves about how I
had scandalized the entire bloodline. I was going to be a pariah."Go," I softly whispered
to the transporter, stamping my foot.

The thin metal rings I wore around each ankle jingled noisily, but I stamped my foot
again. Once on, the transporter worked best when I didn't touch it."Go," I said again,
sweat forming on my brow. When nothing moved, I chanced giving the two large suitcases
sitting atop the force field a shove. They moved smoothly, and I breathed another sigh of
relief. At least some luck was on my side. So, in a distant future part of Africa, Binti is
a mathematical genius of the Himba ethnic group. She's been accepted into a university on
another planet, and she's decided to go. Carrying the blood of her people in her veins,
adorned with the teachings, ways, even the land on her very skin, Binti leaves the
earth. As the story progresses, she becomes not other, but more. This idea of leaving but
bringing and then becoming more is at one of the hearts of Afrofuturism, or you can simply
call it a different type of science fiction.

I can best explain the difference between classic science fiction and Afrofuturism if I
used the octopus analogy. Like humans, octopuses are some of the most intelligent
creatures on earth. However, octopus intelligence evolved from a different evolutionary
line, separate from that of human beings, so the foundation is different. The same can be
said about the foundations of various forms of science fiction. So much of science fiction
speculates about technologies, societies, social issues, what's beyond our planet, what's
within our planet. Science fiction is one of the greatest and most effective forms of
political writing. It's all about the question, "What if?" Still, not all science fiction
has the same ancestral bloodline, that line being Western-rooted science fiction, which is
mostly white and male. We're talking Isaac Asimov, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, George Orwell,
Robert Heinlein, etc. So what if a Nigerian-American wrote science fiction?

Growing up, I didn't read much science fiction. I couldn't relate to these stories
preoccupied with xenophobia, colonization and seeing aliens as others. And I saw no
reflection of anyone who looked like me in those narratives. In the "Binti" novella
trilogy, Binti leaves the planet to seek education from extraterrestrials. She goes out as
she is, looking the way she looks, carrying her cultures, being who she is. I was inspired
to write this story not because I was following a line of classic space opera narratives,
but because of blood that runs deep, family, cultural conflict and the need to see an
African girl leave the planet on her own terms. My science fiction had different
ancestors, African ones. So I'm Nigerian-American. I was born to two Nigerian immigrant
parents and raised in the United States, one of the birthplaces of classic science
fiction. However, it was my Nigerian heritage that led me to write science
fiction.

Specifically I cite those family trips to Nigeria in the late '90s. I'd been taking trips
back to Nigeria with my family since I was very young. These early trips inspired me.
Hence the first story that I ever even wrote took place in Nigeria. I wrote mainly magical
realism and fantasy inspired by my love of Igbo and other West African traditional
cosmologies and spiritualities. However, in the late '90s, I started noticing the role of
technology in Nigeria: cable TV and cell phones in the village, 419 scammers occupying the
cybercafes, the small generator connected to my cousin's desktop computer because the
power was always going on and off. And my Americanness othered me enough to be intrigued
by these things that most Nigerians saw as normal. My intrigue eventually gave birth to
stories. I started opening strange doors. What if aliens came to Lagos, Nigeria? This is
an excerpt from my novel, "Lagoon."Everybody saw it, all over the world.

That was a real introduction to the great mess happening in Lagos, Nigeria, West Africa,
Africa, here. Because so many people in Lagos had portable, chargeable, glowing,
vibrating, chirping, tweeting, communicating, connected devices, practically everything
was recorded and posted online in some way, somehow, quickly. The modern human world is
connected like a spider's web. The world was watching. It watched in fascinated horror for
information, but mostly for entertainment. Footage of what was happening dominated every
international news source, video-sharing website, social network, circle, pyramid and
trapezoid. But the story goes deeper. It is in the mud, the dirt, the earth, in the fond
memory of the soily cosmos. It is in the always mingling past, present and future. It is
in the water. It is in the powerful spirits and ancestors who dwelled in Lagos. It is in
the hearts and minds of the people of Lagos. Change begets change. The alien Ayodele knew
it.

All her people know it. So, this is a voice of Udide, the supreme spider artist, who is
older than dirt and lives in the dirt beneath the city of Lagos, listening and commenting
and weaving the story of extraterrestrials coming to Lagos. In the end, the great spider
who was the size of a house and responsible for weaving the past, present and future
decides to come forth and be a part of the story. Like Udide, the spider artist, African
science fiction's blood runs deep and it's old, and it's ready to come forth, and when it
does, imagine the new technologies, ideas and sociopolitical changes it'll inspire. For
Africans, homegrown science fiction can be a will to power. What if? It's a powerful
question. Thank you.
