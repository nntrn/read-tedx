You're standing at the ready inside the goal when suddenly, you feel an intense itch on
the back of your head. We've all experienced the annoyance of an inconvenient itch, but
have you ever pondered why we itch in the first place? The average person experiences
dozens of individual itches each day. They can be triggered by all sorts of things,
including allergic reactions, dryness, and even some diseases. And then there are the
mysterious ones that pop up for no reason at all, or just from talking about itching.
You're scratching your head right now, aren't you? Anyhow, let's take one of the most
common sources: bug bites. When a mosquito bites you, it releases a compound into your
body called an anticoagulant that prevents your blood from clotting. That compound, which
we're mildly allergic to, triggers the release of histamine, a chemical that makes our
capillaries swell. This enables increased blood flow, which helpfully accelerates the
body's immune response to this perceived threat.

That explains the swelling, and it's the same reason pollen can make your eyes puff up.
Histamine also activates the nerves involved in itching, which is why bug bites make you
scratch. But the itchy sensation itself isn't yet fully understood. In fact, much of what
we do know comes from studying the mechanics of itching in mice. Researchers have
discovered that itch signals in their skin are transmitted via a subclass of the nerves
that are associated with pain. These dedicated nerves produce a molecule called
natriuretic polypetide B, which triggers a signal that's carried up the spinal cord to the
brain, where it creates the feeling of an itch. When we scratch, the action of our
fingernails on the skin causes a low level pain signal that overrides the itching
sensation. It's almost like a distraction, which creates the sensation of relief. But is
there actually an evolutionary purpose to the itch, or is it simply there to annoy
us?

The leading theory is that our skin has evolved to be acutely aware of touch so that we're
equipped to deal with risks from the outside world. Think about it. Our automatic
scratching response would dislodge anything harmful that's potentially lurking on our
skin, like a harmful sting, a biting insect, or the tendrils of a poisonous plant. This
might explain why we don't feel itching inside our bodies, like in our intestines, which
is safe from these external threats, though imagine how maddening that would be. In some
people, glitches in the pathways responsible for all of this can cause excessive itching
that can actually harm their health. One extreme example is a psychological condition
called delusory parasitosis where people believe their bodies are infested with mites or
fleas scurrying over and under their skin, making them itch incessantly. Another
phenomenon called phantom itching can occur in patients who've had amputations.

Because this injury has so severely damaged the nervous system, it confuses the body's
normal nerve signaling and creates sensations in limbs that are no longer there. Doctors
are now finding ways to treat these itching anomalies. In amputees, mirrors are used to
reflect the remaining limb, which the patient scratches. That creates an illusion that
tricks the brain into thinking the imaginary itch has been satisfied. Oddly enough, that
actually works. Researchers are also searching for the genes involved in itching and
developing treatments to try and block the pathway of an itch in extreme cases. If having
an unscratchable itch feels like your own personal hell, Dante agreed. The Italian poet
wrote about a section of hell where people were punished by being left in pits to itch for
all eternity.
