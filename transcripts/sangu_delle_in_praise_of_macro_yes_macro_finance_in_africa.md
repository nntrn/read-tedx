title: In praise of macro -- yes, macro -- finance in Africa
speaker: Sangu Delle
description: >-
 In this short, provocative talk, financier Sangu Delle questions whether
 microfinance — small loans to small entrepreneurs -- is the best way to drive
 growth in developing countries. "We seem to be fixated on this romanticized idea
 that every poor person in Africa is an entrepreneur,” he says. "Yet, my work has
 taught me that most people want jobs.” Delle, a TED Fellow, makes the case for
 supporting large companies and factories — and clearing away the obstacles to
 pan-African trade.

Traditional prescriptions for growth in Africa are not working very well. After one
trillion dollars in African development-related aid in the last 60 years, real per capita
income today is lower than it was in the 1970s. Aid is not doing too well. In response, the
Bretton Woods institutions — the IMF and the World Bank — pushed for free trade not aid,
yet the historical record shows little empirical evidence that free trade leads to
economic growth. The newly prescribed silver bullet is microcredit. We seem to be fixated
on this romanticized idea that every poor peasant in Africa is an entrepreneur.

Yet my work and travel in 40-plus countries across Africa have taught me that most people
want jobs instead. My solution: Forget micro-entrepreneurs. Let's invest in building
pan-African titans like Sudanese businessman Mo Ibrahim. Mo took a contrarian bet on
Africa when he founded Celtel International in '98 and built it into a mobile cellular
provider with 24 million subscribers across 14 African countries by 2004. The Mo model
might be better than the everyman entrepreneur model, which prevents an effective means of
diffusion and knowledge-sharing. Perhaps we are not at a stage in Africa where many actors
and small enterprises leads to growth through competition. Consider these two alternative
scenarios. One: You loan 200 dollars to each of 500 banana farmers allowing them to dry 
their surplus bananas and fetch 15 percent more revenue at the local market. Or two: You
give 100,000 dollars to one savvy entrepreneur and help her set up a factory that yields
40 percent additional income to all 500 banana farmers and creates 50 additional
jobs.

We invested in the second scenario, and backed 26-year-old Kenyan entrepreneur Eric
Muthomi to set up an agro-processing factory called Stawi to produce gluten-free
banana-based flour and baby food. Stawi is leveraging economies of scale and using modern
manufacturing processes to create value for not only its owners but its workers, who have
an ownership in the business. Our dream is to take an Eric Muthomi and try to help him
become a Mo Ibrahim, which requires skill, financing, local and global partnerships, and
extraordinary perseverance. But why pan-African? The scramble for Africa during the Berlin
Conference of 1884 — where, quite frankly, we Africans were not exactly consulted —

— resulted in massive fragmentation and many sovereign states with small populations:
Liberia, four million; Cape Verde, 500,000. Pan-Africa gives you one billion people,
granted across 55 countries with trade barriers and other impediments, but our ancestors
traded across the continent before Europeans drew lines around us. The pan-African
opportunities outweigh the challenges, and that's why we're expanding Stawi's markets from
just Kenya to Algeria, Nigeria, Ghana, and anywhere else that will buy our food. We hope
to help solve food security, empower farmers, create jobs, develop the local economy, and
we hope to become rich in the process. While it's not the sexiest approach, and maybe it
doesn't achieve the same feel-good as giving a woman 100 dollars to buy a goat on
kiva.org, perhaps supporting fewer, higher-impact entrepreneurs to build massive
businesses that scale pan-Africa can help change this. The political freedom for which our
forebearers fought is meaningless without economic freedom.

We hope to aid this fight for economic freedom by building world-class businesses,
creating indigenous wealth, providing jobs that we so desperately need, and hopefully
helping achieve this. Africa shall rise. Thank you.

Tom Rielly: So Sangu, of course, this is strong rhetoric. You're making 100 percent
contrast between microcredit and regular investment and growing regular investment. Do you
think there is a role for microcredit at all? Sangu Delle: I think there is a role.
Microcredit has been a great, innovative way to expand financial access to the bottom of
the pyramid. But for the problems we face in Africa, when we are looking at the Marshall
Plan to revitalize war-torn Europe, it was not full of donations of sheep. We need more
than just microcredit. We need more than just give 200 dollars. We need to build big
businesses, and we need jobs. TR: Very good. Thank you so much.
