title: A secret memorial for civilian casualties
speaker: Matt Kenyon
description: >-
 In the fog of war, civilian casualties often go uncounted. Artist Matt Kenyon,
 whose recent work memorialized the names and stories of US soldiers killed in the
 Iraq war, decided he should create a companion monument, to the Iraqi civilians
 caught in the war's crossfire. Learn how he built a secret monument to place
 these names in the official record.

There's this quote by activist and punk rock musician Jello Biafra that I love. He says,
"Don't hate the media. Be the media." I'm an artist. I like working with media and
technology because A, I'm familiar with them and I like the power they hold. And B, I hate
them and I'm terrified of the power they hold.

I remember watching, in 2003, an interview between Fox News host Tony Snow and then-US
Defense Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. They were talking about the recent invasion of Iraq,
and Rumsfeld is asked the question, "Well, we're hear about our body counts, but we never
hear about theirs, why?" And Rumsfeld's answer is, "Well, we don't do body counts on other
people." Right? It's estimated that between 150,000 to one million Iraqis, civilians, have
died as a result of the US-led invasion in 2003. That number is in stark contrast with the
4,486 US service members who died during that same window of time. I wanted to do more
than just bring awareness to this terrifying number. I wanted to create a monument for the
individual civilians who died as a result of the invasion. Monuments to war, such as Maya
Lin's Vietnam Memorial, are often enormous in scale. Very powerful and very one-sided. I
wanted my monument to live in the world, and to circulate.

I remember when I was a boy in school, my teacher assigned us this classic civics
assignment where you take a sheet of paper and you write a member of your government. And
we were told, if we wrote a really good letter, if we really thought about it, we would
get back more than just a simple formed letter as a reply. This is my "Notepad." What looks
like an everyday, yellow legal tablet of paper is actually a monument to the individual
Iraqi civilians that died as a result of the US invasion. "Notepad" is an act of protest
and an act of commemoration disguised as an everyday tablet of paper. The lines of the
paper, when magnified, are revealed to be micro-printed text that contains the details,
the names, the dates and locations of individual Iraqi civilians that died. So, for the
last 5 years, I've been taking pads of this paper, tons of this stuff, and smuggling it
into the stationery supplies of the United States and the Coalition governments.

I don't have to tell you guys this is not the place to discuss how I did
that.

But also, I've been meeting one-on-one with members and former members of the so-called
Coalition of the Willing, who assisted in the invasion. And so, whenever I can, I meet with
one of them, and I share the project with them. And last summer, I had the chance to meet
with former United States Attorney General and Torture Memo author, Alberto
Gonzales.

Matt Kenyon: May I give this to you? This is a special legal tablet. It's actually part of
an ongoing art project. Alberto Gonzalez: This is a special legal pad? MK: Yes. You won't
believe me, but it's in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art; I'm an artist. MK: And
all of the lines of the paper are actually —AG: Are they going to disappear? MK: No,
they're micro-printed text that contains the names of individual Iraqi civilians who have
died since the invasion of Iraq. AG: Yeah. OK.AG: Thank you. MK: Thank you.

The way he says "thank you" really creeps me out.

OK, so I'd like each of you to look under your chairs. There's an envelope. And please
open it. The paper you're holding in your hand contains the details of Iraqi civilians
that died as result of the invasion. I'd like you to use this paper and write a member of
government. You can help to smuggle this civilian body count into government archives.
Because every letter that's sent in to the government, and this is all across the world,
of course — every letter that is sent in is archived, filed and recorded. Together, we can
put this in the mailboxes and under the noses of people in power. Everything that's sent
in eventually becomes part of the permanent archive of our government, our shared
historical record. Thank you.

Tom Rielly: So, tell me Matt, how did this idea come into your head, of "Notepad"?Matt
Kenyon: I'd just finished a project that dealt with the US Coalition side of the war and
it was a black armband that was called the "Improvised Empathetic Device" which
accumulated, in real time, the names, ranks, cause of death and location of US service
members who had died overseas, and each time the Department of Defense or CENTCOM released
their data, it would stab me in the arm. And so, I became aware that there was a spectacle
associated with our own people who were dying overseas, but a disproportionate amount of
casualties were the civilian casualties. TR: Thank you so much. MK: Thank
you.
