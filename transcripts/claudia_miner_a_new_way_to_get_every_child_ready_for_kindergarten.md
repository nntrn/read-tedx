title: A new way to get every child ready for kindergarten
speaker: Claudia Miner
description: >-
 Early education is critical to children's success -- but millions of kids in the
 United States still don't have access to programs that prepare them to thrive in
 kindergarten and beyond. Enter the UPSTART Project, a plan to bring early
 learning into the homes of children in underserved communities, at no cost to
 families. Education innovator Claudia Miner shares how UPSTART is setting
 four-year-olds up for success with 15 minutes of learning a day -- and how you
 can help. (This ambitious plan is a part of the Audacious Project, TED's
 initiative to inspire and fund global change.)

I'm an historian. And what I love about being an historian is it gives you
perspective. Today, I'd like to bring that perspective to education in the United States.
About the only thing people can agree on is that the most strategic time for a child to
start learning is early. Over 50 years ago, there was a watershed moment in early
education in the US called "Head Start." Now, historians love watersheds because it makes
it so easy to talk about what came before and what's happened since. Before Head Start,
basically nothing. With Head Start, we began to get our nation's most at-risk children
ready for school. Since Head Start, we've made strides, but there are still 2.2 million
children in the US without access to early learning, or more than half of the
four-year-olds in the country. That's a problem. But the bigger problem is what we know
happens to those children. At-risk children who reach school without basic skills are 25
percent more likely to drop out, 40 percent more likely to become teen parents and 60
percent less likely to go to college. So if we know how important early education is, why
aren't all children getting it?

There are barriers that the solutions we've come up with to date simply can't overcome.
Geography: think rural and remote. Transportation: think working parents everywhere.
Parent choice: no state requires a four-year-old to go to school. And cost: the average
cost for a state to educate a preschooler is five thousand dollars a year. So am I just
going to keep talking about problems? No. Today, I want to tell you about a
cost-effective, technology-delivered, kindergarten-readiness program that can be done in
the home. It's called UPSTART, and more than 60,000 preschoolers in the US have already
used it. Now, I know what you might be thinking: here's another person throwing tech at a
national problem. And you'd be partially right. We develop early learning software
designed to individualize instruction, so children can learn at their own pace. To do
that, we rely on experts from fields ranging from reading to sociology to brain science
development to all aspects of early learning, to tell us what the software should do and
look like. Here's an example.

Zero (sings to the tune of "Day-O"): Zero! Zero! Zero is the number that's different from
the others. Seagulls: Zero is a big, round "O." Zero: It's not like one, I'm sure you'll
discover. Seagulls: Zero is a big, round "O."

Claudia Miner: That is "The Zero Song."

And here are Odd Todd and Even Steven to teach you some things about numbers. And here are
the Word Birds, and they're going to show you when you blend letter sounds together, you
can form words. You can see that instruction is short, colorful and catchy, designed to
capture a child's attention. But there's another piece to UPSTART that makes it different
and more effective. UPSTART puts parents in charge of their children's education. We
believe, with the right support, all parents can get their children ready for
school. Here's how it works. This is the kindergarten readiness checklist from a state. And
almost every state has one. We go to parents wherever they are, and we conduct a key
in-person group training. And we tell them the software can check every reading, math and
science box, but they're going to be responsible for motor skills and self-help skills,
and together, we're going to work on social emotional learning. Now, we know this is
working because we have a 90-percent completion rate for the program.

Last year, that translated into 13,500 children "graduating," with diplomas, from UPSTART.
And the results have been amazing. We have an external evaluation that shows our children
have two to three times the learning gains as children who don't participate in the
program. We have a random control trial that shows strong evidence of effectiveness, and
we even have a longitudinal study that shows our children's gains last into third and
fourth grade, the highest grades the children had achieved at the time. Those are academic
gains. But another study has shown that our children's social emotional gains are equal to
those of children attending public and private preschool. The majority of the 60,000
children who have participated in UPSTART to date have been from Utah. But we have
replicated our results with African-American children in Mississippi — this is Kingston
and his mother; with English language learners in Arizona — this is Daisy and her family;
with refugee children in Philadelphia — this is my favorite graduation photo; and with
Native American children from some of the most remote parts of the United
States.

This is Cherise, and this is where she lives in Monument Valley. Now, there are skeptics
about UPSTART. Some people don't believe young children should have screen time. To them,
we say: UPSTART's usage requirement of 15 minutes a day, five days a week, is well within
the hour-a-day recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics for four-year-olds. Some
people believe only site-based preschool can work, and to them, we say: site-based
preschool is great, but if you can't get a child there or if a parent won't send a child
there, isn't a technology-delivered, results-based option a great alternative? And we love
working with site-based preschools. Right now, there are 800 children in Mississippi going
to Head Start during the day and doing UPSTART at night with their families. Our audacious
idea is to take UPSTART across the country — not to replace anything; we want to serve
children who otherwise would not have access to early education.

We have the guts to take on the skeptics, we have the energy to do the work, and we have a
plan. It is the role of the states to educate their children. So first we will use
philanthropy dollars to go into a state to pilot the program and get data. Every state
believes it's unique and wants to know that the program will work with its children before
investing. Then we identify key leaders in the state to help us champion UPSTART as an
option for unserved children. And together, we go to state legislatures to transition
UPSTART from philanthropy to sustainable and scalable state funding. That plan has worked
—

Thanks. Thank you. That plan has worked in three states to date: Utah, Indiana and South
Carolina. We've also piloted the program in a number of states and identified champions.
Next, we're moving to states with the greatest geographic barriers to work the plan, and
then on to states that already have early education but may not be getting great academic
results or great parent buy-in to participate. From there, we go to the states that are
going to require the most data and work to convince, and we'll hope our momentum helps
turn the tide there. We will serve a quarter of a million children in five years, and we
will ensure that states continue to offer UPSTART to their children. Here's how you can
help: for two thousand dollars, we can provide a child with UPSTART, a computer and
internet, and that child will be part of the pilot that makes certain other children get
UPSTART in the future.

We also need engaged citizens to go to their government and say just how easy it can be to
get children ready for school. You wouldn't be here if you weren't an engaged citizen, so
we're asking for your help. Now, will all of us this make UPSTART a watershed moment in
early education? I believe together we can make it one. But I can tell you without a doubt
that UPSTART is a watershed moment in the life of a child who otherwise would not be ready
for school. Thank you.
