title: Fashion that celebrates African strength and spirit
speaker: Walé Oyéjidé
description: >-
 "To be African is to be inspired by culture and to be filled with undying hope
 for the future," says designer and TED Fellow Walé Oyéjidé. With his label Ikiré
 Jones (you'll see their work in Marvel's "Black Panther"), he uses classic design
 to showcase the elegance and grace of often-marginalized groups, in beautifully
 cut clothing that tells a story.

It is often said that the stories of history are written by its victors, but if this is
true, what becomes of the downtrodden, and how can they ever hope to aspire for something
greater if they are never told the stories of their own glorious pasts? Ostensibly, I stand
before you as a mere maker of clothing, but within the folds of ancient fabrics and modern
textiles, I have found a higher calling. Through my work as a designer, I've discovered
the importance of providing representation for the marginalized members of our society,
and the importance of telling the most vulnerable among us that they no longer have to
compromise themselves just so they can fit in with an uncompromising majority. It turns
out that fashion, a discipline many of us consider to be trivial, can actually be a
powerful tool for dismantling bias and bolstering the self-images of underrepresented
populations. My interest in using design as a vehicle for social change happens to be a
personal one.

As a Nigerian American, I know how easily the term "African" can slip from being an
ordinary geographic descriptor to becoming a pejorative. For those of us from this
beautiful continent, to be African is to be inspired by culture and to be filled with
undying hope for the future. So in an attempt to shift the misguided perceptions that many
have about the place of my birth, I use design as a means to tell stories, stories about
joy, stories about triumph, stories about perseverance all throughout the African
diaspora. I tell these stories as a concerted effort to correct the historical record,
because, no matter where any of us is from, each of us has been touched by the complicated
histories that brought our families to a foreign land. These histories shape the way we
view the world, and they mold the biases we carry around with us. To combat these biases,
my work draws aesthetics from different parts of the globe and crafts a narrative about
the importance of fighting for inclusivity.

By refashioning images from classic European art and marrying them with African
aesthetics, I am able to recast people of color in roles of prominence, providing them
with a degree of dignity they didn't have in earlier times. This approach subverts the
historically accepted narrative of African inferiority, and it serves as inspiration for
people of color who have grown wary of seeing themselves depicted without sophistication
and without grace. Each of these culture-bending tapestries becomes a tailored garment or a
silk scarf, like the one I am very coincidentally wearing right now.

And even when surrounded in a structure of European classicism, these narratives boldly
extoll the merits of African empowerment. In this way, the tools of the masters become
masterworks to celebrate those who were once subservient. This metaphor extends beyond the
realm of art and out into the real world. Whether worn by refugees or world-changing
entrepreneurs, when people are allowed the freedom to present themselves in a manner that
celebrates their own unique identities, a magical thing happens. We stand taller. We're
more proud and self-aware because we're presenting our true, authentic selves. And those
of us who are around them in turn become more educated, more open and more tolerant of
their different points of view. In this way, the clothes that we wear can be a great
illustration of diplomatic soft power. The clothes that we wear can serve as bridges
between our seemingly disparate cultures. And so, yeah, ostensibly I stand before you as a
mere maker of clothing.

But my work has always been about more than fashion. It has become my purpose to rewrite
the cultural narratives so that people of color can be seen in a new and nuanced light,
and so that we, the proud children of sub-Saharan Africa, can traverse the globe while
carrying ourselves with pride. It was indeed true that the stories of history were told by
its old victors, but I am of a new generation. My work speaks for those who will no longer
let their futures be dictated by a troubled past. Today, we stand ready to tell our own
stories without compromise, without apologies. But the question still remains: are you
prepared for what you are about to hear? I hope you are, because we are coming
regardless.
