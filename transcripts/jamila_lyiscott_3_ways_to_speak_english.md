title: 3 ways to speak English
speaker: Jamila Lyiscott
description: >-
 Jamila Lyiscott is a “tri-tongued orator;” in her powerful spoken-word essay
 “Broken English,” she celebrates — and challenges — the three distinct flavors of
 English she speaks with her friends, in the classroom and with her parents. As
 she explores the complicated history and present-day identity that each language
 represents, she unpacks what it means to be “articulate.”

Today, a baffled lady observed the shell where my soul dwellsAnd announced that I'm
"articulate" Which means that when it comes to enunciation and dictionI don't even think of
it‘Cause I’m "articulate" So when my professor asks a questionAnd my answer is tainted with
a connotation of urbanized suggestionThere’s no misdirected intentionPay attention‘Cause
I’m “articulate”So when my father asks, “Wha’ kinda ting is dis?”My “articulate” answer
never goes amissI say “father, this is the impending problem at hand”And when I’m on the
block I switch it up just because I canSo when my boy says, “What’s good with you son?”I
just say, “I jus’ fall out wit dem people but I done!”And sometimes in classI might pause
the intellectual sounding flow to ask“Yo! Why dese books neva be about my peoples”Yes, I
have decided to treat all three of my languages as equalsBecause I’m “articulate”But who
controls articulation? Because the English language is a multifaceted orationSubject to
indefinite transformationNow you may think that it is ignorant to speak broken EnglishBut
I’m here to tell you that even “articulate” Americans sound foolish to the BritishSo when
my Professor comes on the block and says, “Hello”I stop him and say “Noooo …You’re being
inarticulate … the proper way is to say ‘what’s good’”Now you may think that’s too hood,
that’s not coolBut I’m here to tell you that even our language has rulesSo when Mommy
mocks me and says “ya’ll-be-madd-going-to-the-store”I say “Mommy, no, that sentence is not
following the lawNever does the word "madd" go before a present participleThat’s simply
the principle of this English”If I had the vocal capacity I would sing this from every
mountaintop,From every suburbia, and every hood‘Cause the only God of language is the one
recorded in the GenesisOf this world saying “it is good" So I may not always come before
you with excellency of speechBut do not judge me by my language and assumeThat I’m too
ignorant to teach‘Cause I speak three tonguesOne for each:Home, school and friendsI’m a
tri-lingual oratorSometimes I’m consistent with my language nowThen switch it up so I
don’t bore laterSometimes I fight back two tonguesWhile I use the other one in the
classroomAnd when I mistakenly mix them upI feel crazy like … I’m cooking in the bathroomI
know that I had to borrow your language because mines was stolenBut you can’t expect me to
speak your history wholly while mines is brokenThese words are spokenBy someone who is
simply fed up with the Eurocentric ideals of this seasonAnd the reason I speak a composite
version of your languageIs because mines was raped away along with my historyI speak
broken English so the profusing gashes can remind usThat our current state is not a
mysteryI’m so tired of the negative images that are driving my people madSo unless you’ve
seen it rob a bank stop calling my hair badI’m so sick of this nonsensical racial
disparitySo don’t call it good unless your hair is known for donating to charityAs much as
has been raped away from our peopleHow can you expect me to treat their imprint on your
languageAs anything less than equalLet there be no confusionLet there be no hesitationThis
is not a promotion of ignoranceThis is a linguistic celebrationThat’s why I put
"tri-lingual" on my last job applicationI can help to diversify your consumer market is
all I wanted them to knowAnd when they call me for the interview I’ll be more than happy
to show thatI can say:“What’s good”“Whatagwan”And of course …“Hello”Because I’m
“articulate”Thank you.
