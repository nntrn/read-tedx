Now, since this is TEDGlobal, who can tell me what this is called in French? I see you're
all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy — "vielle à roue." And in Spanish, "zanfona." And in
Italian, "ghironda," okay? Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle. So, these are the different kinds
and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy. The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument that uses a
crank to turn a wheel to rub strings, like the bow of a violin, to produce music. It has
three different kinds of strings. The first string is the drone string, which plays a
continuous sound like the bagpipe. The second string is a melody string, which is played
with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano. And the third string is pretty innovative. It's
also the only instrument that uses this kind of technique. It activates what's called the
buzzing bridge, or the dog. When I turn the crank and I apply pressure, it makes a sound
like a barking dog.

So all of this is pretty innovative, if you consider that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a
thousand years ago and it took two people to play it; one to turn the crank, and another
person — yes — to play the melody by physically pulling up large wooden pegs. Luckily, all
of this changed a couple of centuries later. So, one person could actually play and almost
— this is pretty heavy — carry the hurdy-gurdy. The hurdy-gurdy has been used,
historically, through the centuries in mostly dance music because of the uniqueness of the
melody combined with the acoustic boombox here. And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all
sorts of music — traditional folk music, dance, contemporary and world music — in the
U.K., in France, in Spain and in Italy. And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from
three to five years [to order and receive it]. It's made by specialized luthiers, also in
Europe. And it's very difficult to tune. So without further ado, would you like to hear
it?(Audience: Yes.)Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you.

Would you like to hear it? (Audience: Yes!)CP: Okay. There I go. I'd like to sing in
Basque, which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live, in the region in
France and Spain.

[Basque]

Thank you.

This is a song that I wrote based on traditional Basque rhythms. And this is a song that
has a kind of a Celtic feel.

Thank you. Thank you.
