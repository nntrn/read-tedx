Rollercoaster, carousel. Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. You
can grab the ring, you can ring that bell,when the ride is over, you can never tell. People
tell you this one thing — will make your life complete. So you, you give it everything you
got and you wind up on the street. Then one day you wake up,and they tell you "you're a
queen,"but then you find that someone else is pulling on the strings. Rollercoaster,
carousel. Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. You can grab the
ring, you can ring that bell,when the ride is over, you can never tell. The one you love,
they love you — oh yeah — until the end of time. But lose your edge or lose your cool, they
will drop you like a dime. Everyone is crowding 'round when fortune is your friend. When
your luck is running out, you're all alone again. Rollercoaster, carousel. Where the highs
are heaven but the lows, oh, they can be hell. You can grab the ring, you can ring that
bell, when the ride is over you can never tell. Well, maybe I'm just cynical, and all these
words are lies,but experience keeps telling me that the cautious one is wise. But caution
makes you hesitate, and hesitate you're lost,so take your opportunities and never count
the cost. Rollercoaster, carousel.

Where the highs are heaven, but the lows, oh, they can be hell. You can grab the ring, you
can ring that bell,when the ride is over — over, over, you can never, ever
tell. Rollercoaster, carousel, rollercoaster, yeah, yeah, yeah, carousel. Carousel,
carousel, carousel, carousel.

Michael Pemberton.

Thank you so much. Thank you.
