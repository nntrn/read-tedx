I'm a tourism entrepreneur and a peacebuilder, but this is not how I started. When I was
seven years old, I remember watching television and seeing people throwing rocks, and
thinking, this must be a fun thing to do. So I got out to the street and threw rocks, not
realizing I was supposed to throw rocks at Israeli cars. Instead, I ended up stoning my
neighbors' cars. 

They were not enthusiastic about my patriotism. This is my picture with my brother. This is
me, the little one, and I know what you're thinking: "You used to look cute, what the heck
happened to you?" But my brother, who is older than me, was arrested when he was 18, taken
to prison on charges of throwing stones. He was beaten up when he refused to confess that
he threw stones, and as a result, had internal injuries that caused his death soon after
he was released from prison. I was angry, I was bitter, and all I wanted was revenge. But
that changed when I was 18. I decided that I needed Hebrew to get a job, and going to
study Hebrew in that classroom was the first time I ever met Jews who were not soldiers.
And we connected over really small things, like the fact that I love country music, which
is really strange for Palestinians. But it was then that I realized also that we have a
wall of anger, of hatred and of ignorance that separates us.

I decided that it doesn't matter what happens to me. What really matters is how I deal
with it. And therefore, I decided to dedicate my life to bringing down the walls that
separate people. I do so through many ways. Tourism is one of them, but also media and
education, and you might be wondering, really, can tourism change things? Can it bring
down walls? Yes. Tourism is the best sustainable way to bring down those walls and to
create a sustainable way of connecting with each other and creating friendships. In 2009, I
cofounded Mejdi Tours, a social enterprise that aims to connect people, with two Jewish
friends, by the way, and what we'll do, the model we did, for example, in Jerusalem, we
would have two tour guides, one Israeli and one Palestinian, guiding the trips together,
telling history and narrative and archaeology and conflict from totally different
perspectives. I remember running a trip together with a friend named Kobi — Jewish
congregation from Chicago, the trip was in Jerusalem — and we took them to a refugee camp,
a Palestinian refugee camp, and there we had this amazing food.

By the way, this is my mother. She's cool. And that's the Palestinian food called maqluba.
It means "upside-down." You cook it with rice and chicken, and you flip it upside-down.
It's the best meal ever. And we'll eat together. Then we had a joint band, Israeli and
Palestinian musicians, and we did some belly-dancing. If you don't know any, I'll teach
you later. But when we left, both sides, they were crying because they did not want to
leave. Three years later, those relationships still exist. Imagine with me if the one
billion people who travel internationally every year travel like this, not being taken in
the bus from one side to another, from one hotel to another, taking pictures from the
windows of their buses of people and cultures, but actually connecting with people. You
know, I remember having a Muslim group from the U.K. going to the house of an Orthodox
Jewish family, and having their first Friday night dinners, that Sabbath dinner, and
eating together hamin, which is a Jewish food, a stew, just having the connection of
realizing, after a while, that a hundred years ago, their families came out of the same
place in Northern Africa.

This is not a photo profile for your Facebook. This is not disaster tourism. This is the
future of travel, and I invite you to join me to do that, to change your travel. We're
doing it all over the world now, from Ireland to Iran to Turkey, and we see ourselves
going everywhere to change the world. Thank you.
