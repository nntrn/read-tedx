title: If superpowers were real: Super speed
speaker: Joy Lin
description: >-
 What if super speed wasn't just the stuff of epic comic book stories? Is it
 scientifically possible to be super speed? In this series Joy Lin tackles six
 superpowers and reveals just how scientifically realistic they can be to us mere
 mortals. [Directed by Cognitive Media, narrated by James Arnold Taylor].

Some superheros can move faster than the wind. The men in Apollo 10 reached a
record-breaking speed of around 25,000 miles per hour when the shuttle re-entered the
Earth's atmosphere in 1969. Wouldn't we save a lot of time to be able to move that fast?
But what's the catch? Air is not empty. Elements like oxygen and nitrogen, even countless
dust particles, make up the air around us. When we move past these things in the air,
we're rubbing against them and creating a lot of friction, which results in heat. Just
like rubbing your hands together warms them up or rubbing two sticks together makes fire,
the faster objects rub together, the more heat is generated. So, if we're running at
25,000 miles per hour, the heat from friction would burn our faces off. Even if we somehow
withstood the heat, the sand and dirt in the air would still scrape us up with millions of
tiny cuts all happening at the same time. Ever seen the front bumper or grill of a
truck?

What do you think all the birds and bugs would do to your open eyes or exposed skin? Okay,
so you'll wear a mask to avoid destroying your face. But what about people in buildings
between you and your destination? It takes us approximately one-fifth of a second to react
to what we see. By the time we see what is ahead of us and react to it - time times
velocity equals distance equals one-fifth of a second times 25,000 miles per hour equals
1.4 miles - we would have gone past it or through it by over a mile. We're either going to
kill ourselves by crashing into the nearest wall at super speed or, worse, if we're
indestructible, we've essentially turned our bodies into missiles that destroy everything
in our path. So, long distance travel at 25,000 miles per hour would leave us burning up,
covered in bugs, and leaves no time to react. What about short bursts to a location we can
see with no obstacles in between? Okay, let's say a bullet is about to hit a beautiful
damsel in distress.

So, our hero swoops in at super speed, grabs her, and carries her to safety. That sounds
very romantic, but, in reality, that girl will probably suffer more damage from the hero
than the bullet if he moved her at super speed. Newton's First Law of Motion deals with
inertia, which is the resistance to a change in its state of motion. So, an object will
continue moving or staying at the same place unless something changes it. Acceleration is
the rate the velocity changes over time. When the girl at rest, velocity equals zero miles
per hour, begins accelerating to reach the speed within seconds, velocity increases
rapidly to 25,000 miles per hour, her brain would crash into the side of her skull. And,
when she stops suddenly, velocity decreases rapidly back to zero miles per hour, her brain
would crash into the other side of her skull, turning her brain into mush. The brain is
too fragile to handle the sudden movement. So is every part of her body, for that
matter.

Remember, it's not the speed that causes the damage because the astronauts survived Apollo
10, it's the acceleration or sudden stop that causes our internal organs to crash into the
front of our bodies the way we move forward in a bus when the driver slams on the brakes.
What the hero did to the girl is mathematically the same as running her over with a space
shuttle at maximum speed. She probably died instantly at the point of impact. He's going
to owe this poor girl's family an apology and a big fat compensation check. Oh, and
possibly face jail time. Doctors have to carry liability insurance just in case they make
a mistake and hurt their patients. I wonder how much superhero insurance policy would
cost. Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next? Shifting body size and
content, super speed, flight, super strength, immortality, and invisibility.
