title: Dark matter: The matter we can't see
speaker: James Gillies
description: >-
 The Greeks had a simple and elegant formula for the universe: just earth fire
 wind and water. Turns out there's more to it than that -- a lot more. Visible
 matter (and that goes beyond the four Greek elements) comprises only 4% of the
 universe. CERN scientist James Gillies tells us what accounts for the remaining
 96% (dark matter and dark energy) and how we might go about detecting it.

The ancient Greeks had a great idea: The universe is simple. In their minds, all you
needed to make it were four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. As theories go, it's a
beautiful one. It has simplicity and elegance. It says that by combining the four basic
elements in different ways, you could produce all the wonderful diversity of the universe.
Earth and fire, for example, give you things that are dry. Air and water, things that are
wet. But as theories go, it had a problem. It didn't predict anything that could be
measured, and measurement is the basis of experimental science. Worse still, the theory
was wrong. But the Greeks were great scientists of the mind and in the 5th century B.C.,
Leucippus of Miletus came up with one of the most enduring scientific ideas ever.
Everything we see is made up of tiny, indivisible bits of stuff called atoms. This theory
is simple and elegant, and it has the advantage over the earth, air, fire, and water
theory of being right.

Centuries of scientific thought and experimentation have established that the real
elements, things like hydrogen, carbon, and iron, can be broken down into atoms. In
Leucippus's theory, the atom is the smallest, indivisible bit of stuff that's still
recognizable as hydrogen, carbon, or iron. The only thing wrong with Leucippus's idea is
that atoms are, in fact, divisible. Furthermore, his atoms idea turns out to explain just
a small part of what the universe is made of. What appears to be the ordinary stuff of the
universe is, in fact, quite rare. Leucippus's atoms, and the things they're made of,
actually make up only about 5% of what we know to be there. Physicists know the rest of
the universe, 95% of it, as the dark universe, made of dark matter and dark energy. How do
we know this? Well, we know because we look at things and we see them. That might seem
rather simplistic, but it's actually quite profound. All the stuff that's made of atoms is
visible.

Light bounces off it, and we can see it. When we look out into space, we see stars and
galaxies. Some of them, like the one we live in, are beautiful, spiral shapes, spinning
gracefully through space. When scientists first measured the motion of groups of galaxies
in the 1930's and weighed the amount of matter they contained, they were in for a
surprise. They found that there's not enough visible stuff in those groups to hold them
together. Later measurements of individual galaxies confirmed this puzzling result.
There's simply not enough visible stuff in galaxies to provide enough gravity to hold them
together. From what we can see, they ought to fly apart, but they don't. So there must be
stuff there that we can't see. We call that stuff dark matter. The best evidence for dark
matter today comes from measurements of something called the cosmic microwave background,
the afterglow of the Big Bang, but that's another story.

All of the evidence we have says that dark matter is there and it accounts for much of the
stuff in those beautiful spiral galaxies that fill the heavens. So where does that leave
us? We've long known that the heavens do not revolve around us and that we're residents of
a fairly ordinary planet, orbiting a fairly ordinary star, in the spiral arm of a fairly
ordinary galaxy. The discovery of dark matter took us one step further away from the
center of things. It told us that the stuff we're made of is only a small fraction of what
makes up the universe. But there was more to come. Early this century, scientists studying
the outer reaches of the universe confirmed that not only is everything moving apart from
everything else, as you would expect in a universe that began in hot, dense big bang, but
that the universe's expansion also seems to be accelerating. What's that about? Either
there is some kind of energy pushing this acceleration, just like you provide energy to
accelerate a car, or gravity does not behave exactly as we think.

Most scientists think it's the former, that there's some kind of energy driving the
acceleration, and they called it dark energy. Today's best measurements allow us to work
out just how much of the universe is dark. It looks as if dark energy makes up about 68%
of the universe and dark matter about 27%, leaving just 5% for us and everything else we
can actually see. So what's the dark stuff made of? We don't know, but there's one theory,
called supersymmetry, that could explain some of it. Supersymmetry, or SUSY for short,
predicts a whole range of new particles, some of which could make up the dark matter. If
we found evidence for SUSY, we could go from understanding 5% of our universe, the things
we can actually see, to around a third. Not bad for a day's work. Dark energy would
probably be harder to understand, but there are some speculative theories out there that
might point the way.

Among them are theories that go back to that first great idea of the ancient Greeks, the
idea that we began with several minutes ago, the idea that the universe must be simple.
These theories predict that there is just a single element from which all the universe's
wonderful diversity stems, a vibrating string. The idea is that all the particles we know
today are just different harmonics on the string. Unfortunately, string theories today
are, as yet, untestable. But, with so much of the universe waiting to be explored, the
stakes are high. Does all of this make you feel small? It shouldn't. Instead, you should
marvel in the fact that, as far as we know, you are a member of the only species in the
universe able even to begin to grasp its wonders, and you're living at the right time to
see our understanding explode.
