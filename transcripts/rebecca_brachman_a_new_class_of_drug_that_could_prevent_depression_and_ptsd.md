title: A new class of drug that could prevent depression and PTSD
speaker: Rebecca Brachman
description: >-
 Current treatments for depression and PTSD only suppress symptoms, if they work
 at all. What if we could prevent these diseases from developing altogether?
 Neuroscientist and TED Fellow Rebecca Brachman shares the story of her team's
 accidental discovery of a new class of drug that, for the first time ever, could
 prevent the negative effects of stress -- and boost a person's ability to recover
 and grow. Learn how these resilience-enhancing drugs could change the way we
 treat mental illness.

So the first antidepressants were made from, of all things, rocket fuel, left over after
World War II. Which is fitting, seeing as today, one in five soldiers develop depression,
or post-traumatic stress disorder or both. But it's not just soldiers that are at high
risk for these diseases. It's firefighters, ER doctors, cancer patients, aid workers,
refugees — anyone exposed to trauma or major life stress. And yet, despite how commonplace
these disorders are, our current treatments, if they work at all, only suppress
symptoms. In 1798, when Edward Jenner discovered the first vaccine — it happened to be for
smallpox — he didn't just discover a prophylactic for a disease, but a whole new way of
thinking: that medicine could prevent disease. However, for over 200 years, this
prevention was not believed to extend to psychiatric diseases. Until 2014, when my
colleague and I accidentally discovered the first drugs that might prevent depression and
PTSD.

We discovered the drugs in mice, and we're currently studying whether they work in humans.
And these preventative psychopharmaceuticals are not antidepressants. They are a whole new
class of drug. And they work by increasing stress resilience, so let's call them
resilience enhancers. So think back to a stressful time that you've since recovered from.
Maybe a breakup or an exam, you missed a flight. Stress resilience is the active
biological process that allows us to bounce back after stress. Similar to if you have a
cold and your immune system fights it off. And insufficient resilience in the face of a
significant enough stressor, can result in a psychiatric disorder, such as depression. In
fact, most cases of major depressive disorder are initially triggered by stress. And from
what we've seen so far in mice, resilience enhancers can protect against purely biological
stressors, like stress hormones, and social and psychological stressors, like bullying and
isolation. So here is an example where we gave mice three weeks of high levels of stress
hormones.

So, in other words, a biological stressor without a psychological component. And this
causes depressive behavior. And if we give three weeks of antidepressant treatment
beforehand, it has no beneficial effects. But a single dose of a resilience enhancer given
a week before completely prevents the depressive behavior. Even after three weeks of
stress. This is the first time a drug has ever been shown to prevent the negative effects
of stress. Depression and PTSD are chronic, often lifelong, clinical diseases. They also
increase the risk of substance abuse, homelessness, heart disease, Alzheimer's, suicide.
The global cost of depression alone is over three trillion dollars per year. But now,
imagine a scenario where we know someone is predictively at high risk for exposure to
extreme stress. Say, a red cross volunteer going into an earthquake zone. In addition to
the typhoid vaccine, we could give her a pill or an injection of a resilience enhancer
before she leaves.

So when she is held at gunpoint by looters or worse, she would at least be protected
against developing depression or PTSD after the fact. It won't prevent her from
experiencing the stress, but it will allow her to recover from it. And that's what's
revolutionary here. By increasing resiliency, we can dramatically reduce her
susceptibility to depression and PTSD, possibly saving her from losing her job, her home,
her family or even her life. After Jenner discovered the smallpox vaccine, a lot of other
vaccines rapidly followed. But it was over 150 years before a tuberculosis vaccine was
widely available. Why? In part because society believed that tuberculosis made people more
sensitive and creative and empathetic. And that it was caused by constitution and not
biology. And similar things are still said today about depression. And just as Jenner's
discovery opened the door for all of the vaccines that followed after, the drugs we've
discovered open the possibility of a whole new field: preventative psychopharmacology.

But whether that's 15 years away, or 150 years away, depends not just on the science, but
on what we as a society choose to do with it. Thank you.
