title: How a dragonfly's brain is designed to kill
speaker: Greg Gage
description: >-
 Dragonflies can catch prey with near perfect accuracy, the best among all
 predators. But how does something with so few neurons achieve such prowess? Our
 intrepid neuroscientists explore how a dragonfly unerringly locks onto its preys
 and captures it within milliseconds using just sensors and a fake fly.

Greg Gage: If I asked you to think of a ferocious killer animal, you'd probably think of a
lion, and for all the wonderful predatory skills that a lion has, it still only has about
a 20 percent success rate at catching a meal. Now, one of the most successful hunters in
the entire animal kingdom is surprising: the dragonfly. Now, dragonflies are killer flies,
and when they see a smaller fly, they have about a 97 percent chance of catching it for a
meal. And this is in mid-flight. But how can such a small insect be so precise? In this
episode, we're going to see how the dragonfly's brain is highly specialized to be a deadly
killer.[DIY Neuroscience]So what makes the dragonfly one of the most successful predators
in the animal kingdom? One, it's the eyes. It has near 360-degree vision. Two, the wings.
With individual control of its wings, the dragonfly can move precisely in any direction.
But the real secret to the dragonfly's success is how its brain coordinates this complex
information between the eyes and the wings and turns hunting into a simple
reflex.

To study this, Jaimie's been spending a lot of time socializing with dragonflies. What do
you need to do your experiments? Jaimie Spahr: First of all, you need dragonflies. Oliver: I
have a mesh cage to catch the dragonflies. JS: The more I worked with them, the more
terrified I got of them. They're actually very scary, especially under a microscope. They
have really sharp mandibles, are generally pretty aggressive, which I guess also helps
them to be really good predators. GG: In order to learn what's going on inside the
dragonfly's brain when it sees a prey, we're going to eavesdrop in on a conversation
between the eyes and the wings, and to do that, we need to anesthetize the dragonfly on
ice and make sure we protect its wings so that we can release it afterwards. Now, the
dragonfly's brain is made up of specialized cells called neurons and these neurons are
what allow the dragonfly to see and move so quickly.

The individual neurons form circuits by connecting to each other via long, tiny threads
called axons and the neurons communicate over these axons using electricity. In the
dragonfly, we're going to place little metal wires, or electrodes, along the axon tracks,
and this is what's really cool. In the dragonfly, there's only 16 neurons; that's eight
per eye that tell the wings exactly where the target is. We've placed the electrodes so
that we can record from these neurons that connect the eyes to the wings. Whenever a
message is being passed from the eye to the wing, our electrode intercepts that
conversation in the form of an electrical current, and it amplifies it. Now, we can both
hear it and see it in the form of a spike, which we also call an action potential. Now
let's listen in. Right now, we have the dragonfly flipped upside down, so he's looking
down towards the ground. We're going to take a prey, or what we sometimes call a
target.

In this case, the target's going to be a fake fly. We're going to move it into the
dragonfly's sights.

Oh! Oh, look at that. Look at that, but it's only in one direction. Oh, yes! You don't see
any spikes when I go forward, but they're all when I come back. In our experiments, we were
able to see that the neurons of the dragonfly fired when we moved the target in one
direction but not the other. Now, why is that? Remember when I said that the dragonfly had
near 360-degree vision. Well, there's a section of the eye called the fovea and this is
the part that has the sharpest visual acuity, and you can think of it as its crosshairs.
Remember when I told you the dragonfly had individual precise control of its wings? When a
dragonfly sees its prey, it trains its crosshairs on it and along its axons it sends
messages only to the neurons that control the parts of the wings that are needed to keep
that dragonfly on target. So if the prey is on the left of the dragonfly, only the neurons
that are tugging the wings to the left are fired.

And if the prey moves to the right of the dragonfly, those same neurons are not needed, so
they're going to remain quiet. And the dragonfly speeds toward the prey at a fixed angle
that's communicated by this crosshairs to the wings, and then boom, dinner. Now, all this
happens in a split second, and it's effortless for the dragonfly. It's almost like a
reflex. And this whole incredibly efficient process is called fixation. But there's one
more story to this process. We saw how the neurons respond to movements, but how does the
dragonfly know that something really is prey? This is where size matters. Let's show the
dragonfly a series of dots. Oh, yeah!JS: Yeah, it prefers that one. GG: Out of all the
sizes, we found that the dragonfly responded to smaller targets over larger ones. In other
words, the dragonfly was programmed to go after smaller flies versus something much
larger, like a bird. And as soon as it recognizes something as prey, that poor little fly
only has seconds to live.

Today we got to see how the dragonfly's brain works to make it a very efficient killer.
And let's be thankful that we didn't live 300 million years ago when dragonflies were the
size of cats.
