title: What reality are you creating for yourself?
speaker: Isaac Lidsky
description: >-
 Reality isn't something you perceive; it's something you create in your mind.
 Isaac Lidsky learned this profound lesson firsthand, when unexpected life
 circumstances yielded valuable insights. In this introspective, personal talk, he
 challenges us to let go of excuses, assumptions and fears, and accept the awesome

When Dorothy was a little girl, she was fascinated by her goldfish. Her father explained
to her that fish swim by quickly wagging their tails to propel themselves through the
water. Without hesitation, little Dorothy responded, "Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards
by wagging their heads."

In her mind, it was a fact as true as any other. Fish swim backwards by wagging their
heads. She believed it. Our lives are full of fish swimming backwards. We make assumptions
and faulty leaps of logic. We harbor bias. We know that we are right, and they are wrong.
We fear the worst. We strive for unattainable perfection. We tell ourselves what we can
and cannot do. In our minds, fish swim by in reverse frantically wagging their heads and
we don't even notice them. I'm going to tell you five facts about myself. One fact is not
true. One: I graduated from Harvard at 19 with an honors degree in mathematics. Two: I
currently run a construction company in Orlando. Three: I starred on a television sitcom.
Four: I lost my sight to a rare genetic eye disease. Five: I served as a law clerk to two
US Supreme Court justices. Which fact is not true? Actually, they're all true. Yeah.
They're all true.

At this point, most people really only care about the television show.

I know this from experience. OK, so the show was NBC's "Saved by the Bell: The New Class."
And I played Weasel Wyzell, who was the sort of dorky, nerdy character on the show, which
made it a very major acting challenge for me as a 13-year-old boy.

Now, did you struggle with number four, my blindness? Why is that? We make assumptions
about so-called disabilities. As a blind man, I confront others' incorrect assumptions
about my abilities every day. My point today is not about my blindness, however. It's
about my vision. Going blind taught me to live my life eyes wide open. It taught me to
spot those backwards-swimming fish that our minds create. Going blind cast them into
focus. What does it feel like to see? It's immediate and passive. You open your eyes and
there's the world. Seeing is believing. Sight is truth. Right? Well, that's what I
thought. Then, from age 12 to 25, my retinas progressively deteriorated. My sight became an
increasingly bizarre carnival funhouse hall of mirrors and illusions. The salesperson I
was relieved to spot in a store was really a mannequin. Reaching down to wash my hands, I
suddenly saw it was a urinal I was touching, not a sink, when my fingers felt its true
shape.

A friend described the photograph in my hand, and only then I could see the image
depicted. Objects appeared, morphed and disappeared in my reality. It was difficult and
exhausting to see. I pieced together fragmented, transitory images, consciously analyzed
the clues, searched for some logic in my crumbling kaleidoscope, until I saw nothing at
all. I learned that what we see is not universal truth. It is not objective reality. What
we see is a unique, personal, virtual reality that is masterfully constructed by our
brain. Let me explain with a bit of amateur neuroscience. Your visual cortex takes up about
30 percent of your brain. That's compared to approximately eight percent for touch and two
to three percent for hearing. Every second, your eyes can send your visual cortex as many
as two billion pieces of information. The rest of your body can send your brain only an
additional billion. So sight is one third of your brain by volume and can claim about two
thirds of your brain's processing resources.

It's no surprise then that the illusion of sight is so compelling. But make no mistake
about it: sight is an illusion. Here's where it gets interesting. To create the experience
of sight, your brain references your conceptual understanding of the world, other
knowledge, your memories, opinions, emotions, mental attention. All of these things and
far more are linked in your brain to your sight. These linkages work both ways, and
usually occur subconsciously. So for example, what you see impacts how you feel, and the
way you feel can literally change what you see. Numerous studies demonstrate this. If you
are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man in a video, for example, your answer will
be different if you're told to think about cheetahs or turtles. A hill appears steeper if
you've just exercised, and a landmark appears farther away if you're wearing a heavy
backpack. We have arrived at a fundamental contradiction.

What you see is a complex mental construction of your own making, but you experience it
passively as a direct representation of the world around you. You create your own reality,
and you believe it. I believed mine until it broke apart. The deterioration of my eyes
shattered the illusion. You see, sight is just one way we shape our reality. We create our
own realities in many other ways. Let's take fear as just one example. Your fears distort
your reality. Under the warped logic of fear, anything is better than the uncertain. Fear
fills the void at all costs, passing off what you dread for what you know, offering up the
worst in place of the ambiguous, substituting assumption for reason. Psychologists have a
great term for it: awfulizing.

Right? Fear replaces the unknown with the awful. Now, fear is self-realizing. When you
face the greatest need to look outside yourself and think critically, fear beats a retreat
deep inside your mind, shrinking and distorting your view, drowning your capacity for
critical thought with a flood of disruptive emotions. When you face a compelling
opportunity to take action, fear lulls you into inaction, enticing you to passively watch
its prophecies fulfill themselves. When I was diagnosed with my blinding disease, I knew
blindness would ruin my life. Blindness was a death sentence for my independence. It was
the end of achievement for me. Blindness meant I would live an unremarkable life, small
and sad, and likely alone. I knew it. This was a fiction born of my fears, but I believed
it. It was a lie, but it was my reality, just like those backwards-swimming fish in little
Dorothy's mind. If I had not confronted the reality of my fear, I would have lived
it.

I am certain of that. So how do you live your life eyes wide open? It is a learned
discipline. It can be taught. It can be practiced. I will summarize very briefly. Hold
yourself accountable for every moment, every thought, every detail. See beyond your fears.
Recognize your assumptions. Harness your internal strength. Silence your internal critic.
Correct your misconceptions about luck and about success. Accept your strengths and your
weaknesses, and understand the difference. Open your hearts to your bountiful
blessings. Your fears, your critics, your heroes, your villains â€” they are your excuses,
rationalizations, shortcuts, justifications, your surrender. They are fictions you
perceive as reality. Choose to see through them. Choose to let them go. You are the
creator of your reality. With that empowerment comes complete responsibility. I chose to
step out of fear's tunnel into terrain uncharted and undefined. I chose to build there a
blessed life.

Far from alone, I share my beautiful life with Dorothy, my beautiful wife, with our
triplets, whom we call the Tripskys, and with the latest addition to the family, sweet
baby Clementine. What do you fear? What lies do you tell yourself? How do you embellish
your truth and write your own fictions? What reality are you creating for yourself? In your
career and personal life, in your relationships, and in your heart and soul, your
backwards-swimming fish do you great harm. They exact a toll in missed opportunities and
unrealized potential, and they engender insecurity and distrust where you seek fulfillment
and connection. I urge you to search them out. Helen Keller said that the only thing worse
than being blind is having sight but no vision. For me, going blind was a profound
blessing, because blindness gave me vision. I hope you can see what I see. Thank
you.

Bruno Giussani: Isaac, before you leave the stage, just a question. This is an audience of
entrepreneurs, of doers, of innovators. You are a CEO of a company down in Florida, and
many are probably wondering, how is it to be a blind CEO? What kind of specific challenges
do you have, and how do you overcome them? Isaac Lidsky: Well, the biggest challenge became
a blessing. I don't get visual feedback from people.

BG: What's that noise there? IL: Yeah. So, for example, in my leadership team meetings, I
don't see facial expressions or gestures. I've learned to solicit a lot more verbal
feedback. I basically force people to tell me what they think. And in this respect, it's
become, like I said, a real blessing for me personally and for my company, because we
communicate at a far deeper level, we avoid ambiguities, and most important, my team knows
that what they think truly matters. BG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED. IL: Thank you,
Bruno.
