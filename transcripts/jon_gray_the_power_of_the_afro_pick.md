You don't really look at a toothbrush and say, "I'm great!" But when you look at an Afro
pick, which is a grooming tool, it can remind you in your subconscious to, like, really be
proud and, like, "All right."[Small thing.][Big idea.]An Afro pick is a utilitarian tool
used to maintain the Afro hairstyle. I think the Afro pick was designed for the ergonomics
of creating something that felt like you were running fingers through your hair. The
shape, even the depth that it goes in â€” it's like a hand. You have plastic or nylon teeth,
and then you have the stainless steel or the nickel teeth. I always prefer the metal tooth
just 'cause I like the sound and the ones I know have the black power fist on the
handle. When I think of black hair in America, I think of something that's been policed.
Back in the days, it was expected for black people to chemically treat their hair. Whether
that's healthy for them is a secondary thing to blending in. In the 50s, dancer Ruth
Beckford and a lot of jazz singers were tired of straightening their hair, so they said,
all right, we're going to just let it grow naturally and started rocking natural,
close-cropped hair.

And in the 60s, that style evolved with the formation of the Afro, which was the cropped
hair, natural, picked out into a more spherical shape. You had civil rights leaders,
activists, that adopted the hairstyle as a means of rebellion and black pride. And then
you had musicians like James Brown, who was infamously known for chemically straightening
his hair, reject that and go natural. It went hand-in-hand with his music, so he had songs
like "Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud."The black is beautiful movement is just
rejecting the notion that to be black or to have darker skin, to have a curlier grade of
hair, was something to be ashamed of. I have one of my favorite pictures of my mother and
my grandmother, and my grandmother had a small 'fro, and that was in the 60s. African hair
combs date back to 3500 BCE. The oldest African combs are found in ancient Egypt and
Sudan, so they were making pyramids and combs.

The way the ancient African combs were embellished represented status or tribal
affiliation. It's no coincidence that the fist on the modern Afro pick also sets the tone
for affiliation and what set you claim. And then there's the Black Power movement. Most
movements need their icons, right? You have the fist, you have the 'fro. These things
coincide with the Black Panther aesthetic, where you could kind of spot your tribe from
afar, because you're not just keeping a pick in, like, your beauty kit. It's in your back
pocket, purposely with the first outside of it, and in your hair, you'll rock it in your
'fro. If I think about iconic Afros, I definitely think about Angela Davis. Her 'fro
personifies elegance, style, freedom, rebellion. You feel all of these feelings at once
when you see Angela Davis fighting for her life in federal court. By the 80s, the Afro
style became less radical. The Afro picks are still produced to this day with the clenched
fist, so it's the remnants of the movement in the everyday object. When I was young, it was
just, like, another object.

It was a comb. But as I became more enlightened to really understand the roots and the
origin and the intentionality of the design and why the fist and all of these things ... I
woke up.
