title: The medical potential of AI and metabolites
speaker: Leila Pirhaji
description: >-
 Many diseases are driven by metabolites -- small molecules in your body like fat,
 glucose and cholesterol -- but we don't know exactly what they are or how they
 work. Biotech entrepreneur and TED Fellow Leila Pirhaji shares her plan to build
 an AI-based network to characterize metabolite patterns, better understand how
 disease develops -- and discover more effective treatments.

In 2003, when we sequenced the human genome, we thought we would have the answer to treat
many diseases. But the reality is far from that, because in addition to our genes, our
environment and lifestyle could have a significant role in developing many major
diseases. One example is fatty liver disease, which is affecting over 20 percent of the
population globally, and it has no treatment and leads to liver cancer or liver failure.
So sequencing DNA alone doesn't give us enough information to find effective
therapeutics. On the bright side, there are many other molecules in our body. In fact,
there are over 100,000 metabolites. Metabolites are any molecule that is supersmall in
their size. Known examples are glucose, fructose, fats, cholesterol â€” things we hear all
the time. Metabolites are involved in our metabolism. They are also downstream of DNA, so
they carry information from both our genes as well as lifestyle.

Understanding metabolites is essential to find treatments for many diseases. I've always
wanted to treat patients. Despite that, 15 years ago, I left medical school, as I missed
mathematics. Soon after, I found the coolest thing: I can use mathematics to study
medicine. Since then, I've been developing algorithms to analyze biological data. So, it
sounded easy: let's collect data from all the metabolites in our body, develop
mathematical models to describe how they are changed in a disease and intervene in those
changes to treat them. Then I realized why no one has done this before: it's extremely
difficult.

There are many metabolites in our body. Each one is different from the other one. For some
metabolites, we can measure their molecular mass using mass spectrometry instruments. But
because there could be, like, 10 molecules with the exact same mass, we don't know exactly
what they are, and if you want to clearly identify all of them, you have to do more
experiments, which could take decades and billions of dollars. So we developed an
artificial intelligence, or AI, platform, to do that. We leveraged the growth of
biological data and built a database of any existing information about metabolites and
their interactions with other molecules. We combined all this data as a meganetwork. Then,
from tissues or blood of patients, we measure masses of metabolites and find the masses
that are changed in a disease. But, as I mentioned earlier, we don't know exactly what
they are. A molecular mass of 180 could be either the glucose, galactose or
fructose.

They all have the exact same mass but different functions in our body. Our AI algorithm
considered all these ambiguities. It then mined that meganetwork to find how those
metabolic masses are connected to each other that result in disease. And because of the
way they are connected, then we are able to infer what each metabolite mass is, like that
180 could be glucose here, and, more importantly, to discover how changes in glucose and
other metabolites lead to a disease. This novel understanding of disease mechanisms then
enable us to discover effective therapeutics to target that. So we formed a start-up
company to bring this technology to the market and impact people's lives. Now my team and
I at ReviveMed are working to discover therapeutics for major diseases that metabolites
are key drivers for, like fatty liver disease, because it is caused by accumulation of
fats, which are types of metabolites in the liver.

As I mentioned earlier, it's a huge epidemic with no treatment. And fatty liver disease is
just one example. Moving forward, we are going to tackle hundreds of other diseases with
no treatment. And by collecting more and more data about metabolites and understanding how
changes in metabolites leads to developing diseases, our algorithms will get smarter and
smarter to discover the right therapeutics for the right patients. And we will get closer
to reach our vision of saving lives with every line of code. Thank you.
