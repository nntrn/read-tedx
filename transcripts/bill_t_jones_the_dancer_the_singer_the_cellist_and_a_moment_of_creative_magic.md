title: The dancer, the singer, the cellist ... and a moment of creative magic
speaker: Bill T. Jones
description: >-
 Legendary dance choreographer Bill T. Jones and TED Fellows Joshua Roman and Somi
 didn't know exactly what was going to happen when they took the stage at TED2015.
 They just knew they wanted to offer the audience an opportunity to witness
 creative collaboration in action. The result: An improvised piece they call "The
 Red Circle and the Blue Curtain," so extraordinary it had to be shared ...

Isadora Duncan — 

— crazy, long-legged woman from San Francisco, got tired of this country, and she
wanted to get out. Isadora was famous somewhere around 1908 for putting up a blue curtain,
 and she would stand with her hands over her solar plexus and she would wait, and she
would wait, and then, she would move. 

Josh and I and Somi call this piece "The Red Circle and the Blue Curtain." Red circle. 
Blue curtain. But, this is not the beginning of the 20th century. This is a morning in
Vancouver in 2015.

Come on, Josh!

Go!Are we there yet? I don't think so. Hey, yeah!

What time is it? 

Where are we? Josh. Somi. Bill T.Josh. Somi. Bill T.

Yeah, yeah!
