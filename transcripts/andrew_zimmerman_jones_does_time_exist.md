The earliest time measurements were observations of cycles of the natural world, using
patterns of changes from day to night and season to season to build calendars. More
precise time-keeping, like sundials and mechanical clocks, eventually came along to put
time in more convenient boxes. But what exactly is it that we’re measuring? Is time
something that physically exists, or is it just in our heads? At first the answer seems
obvious— of course time exists; it constantly unfolds all around us, and it’s hard to
imagine the universe without it. But our understanding of time started getting complicated
thanks to Einstein. His theory of relativity tells us that time passes for everyone, but
doesn’t always pass at the same rate for people in different situations, like those
travelling close to the speed of light or orbiting a supermassive black hole. Einstein
resolved the malleability of time by combining it with space to define space-time, which
can bend, but behaves in consistent, predictable ways. Einstein’s theory seemed to confirm
that time is woven into the very fabric of the universe.

But there’s a big question it didn’t fully resolve: why is it we can move through space in
any direction, but through time in only one? No matter what we do, the past is always,
stubbornly, behind us. This is called the arrow of time. When a drop of food coloring is
dropped into a glass of water, we instinctively know that the coloring will drift out from
the drop, eventually filling the glass. Imagine watching the opposite happen. Here, we’d
recognize time as unfolding backwards. We live in a universe where the food coloring
spreads out in the water, not a universe where it collects together. In physics, this is
described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that systems will gain disorder,
or entropy, over time. Systems in our universe move from order to disorder, and it is that
property of the universe that defines the direction of time’s arrow. So if time is such a
fundamental property, it should be in our most fundamental equations describing the
universe, right?

We currently have two sets of equations that govern physics. General relativity describes
the behavior of very large things, while quantum physics explains the very small. One of
the biggest goals in theoretical physics over the last half century has been reconciling
the two into one fundamental “theory of everything." There have been many attempts —none
yet proven— and they treat time in different ways. Oddly enough, one contender called the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation, doesn’t include time at all. Like all current theories of
everything, that equation is speculative. But as a thought experiment, if it or a
similarly time-starved equation turned out to be true, would that mean that time doesn’t
exist, at the most fundamental level? Could time just be some sort of illusion generated
by the limitations of the way we perceive the universe? We don’t yet know, but maybe
that’s the wrong way of thinking about it.

Instead of asking if time exists as a fundamental property, maybe it could exist as an
emergent one. Emergent properties are things that don’t exist in individual pieces of a
system, but do exist for the system as a whole. Each individual water molecule doesn’t
have a tide, but the whole ocean does. A movie creates change through time by using a
series of still images that appear to have a fluid, continuous change between them.
Flipping through the images fast enough, our brains perceive the passage of time from the
sequence of still images. No individual frame of the movie changes or contains the passage
of time, but it’s a property that comes out of how the pieces are strung together. The
movement is real, yet also an illusion. Could the physics of time somehow be a similar
illusion? Physicists are still exploring these and other questions, so we’re far from a
complete explanation. At least for the moment.
