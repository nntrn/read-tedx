title: How we're using AI to discover new antibiotics
speaker: Jim Collins
description: >-
 Before the coronavirus pandemic, bioengineer Jim Collins and his team combined
 the power of AI with synthetic biology in an effort to combat a different looming
 crisis: antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Collins explains how they pivoted their
 efforts to begin developing a series of tools and antiviral compounds to help
 fight COVID-19 -- and shares their plan to discover seven new classes of
 antibiotics over the next seven years. (This ambitious plan is part of The
 Audacious Project, TED's initiative to inspire and fund global change.)

So how are we going to beat this novel coronavirus? By using our best tools: our science
and our technology. In my lab, we're using the tools of artificial intelligence and
synthetic biology to speed up the fight against this pandemic. Our work was originally
designed to tackle the antibiotic resistance crisis. Our project seeks to harness the
power of machine learning to replenish our antibiotic arsenal and avoid a globally
devastating postantibiotic era. Importantly, the same technology can be used to search for
antiviral compounds that could help us fight the current pandemic. Machine learning is
turning the traditional model of drug discovery on its head. With this approach, instead
of painstakingly testing thousands of existing molecules one by one in a lab for their
effectiveness, we can train a computer to explore the exponentially larger space of
essentially all possible molecules that could be synthesized, and thus, instead of looking
for a needle in a haystack, we can use the giant magnet of computing power to find many
needles in multiple haystacks simultaneously. We've already had some early
success.

Recently, we used machine learning to discover new antibiotics that can help us fight off
the bacterial infections that can occur alongside SARS-CoV-2 infections. Two months ago,
TED's Audacious Project approved funding for us to massively scale up our work with the
goal of discovering seven new classes of antibiotics against seven of the world's deadly
bacterial pathogens over the next seven years. For context: the number of new class of
antibiotics that have been discovered over the last three decades is zero. While the quest
for new antibiotics is for our medium-term future, the novel coronavirus poses an
immediate deadly threat, and I'm excited to share that we think we can use the same
technology to search for therapeutics to fight this virus. So how are we going to do it?
Well, we're creating a compound training library and with collaborators applying these
molecules to SARS-CoV-2-infected cells to see which of them exhibit effective
activity.

These data will be use to train a machine learning model that will be applied to an in
silico library of over a billion molecules to search for potential novel antiviral
compounds. We will synthesize and test the top predictions and advance the most promising
candidates into the clinic. Sound too good to be true? Well, it shouldn't. The Antibiotics
AI Project is founded on our proof of concept research that led to the discovery of a
novel broad-spectrum antibiotic called Halocin. Halocin has potent antibacterial activity
against almost all antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens, including untreatable
panresistant infections. Importantly, in contrast to current antibiotics, the frequency at
which bacteria develop resistance against Halocin is remarkably low. We tested the ability
of bacteria to evolve resistance against Halocin as well as Cipro in the lab. In the case
of Cipro, after just one day, we saw resistance. In the case of Halocin, after one day, we
didn't see any resistance.

Amazingly, after even 30 days, we didn't see any resistance against Halocin. In this pilot
project, we first tested roughly 2,500 compounds against E. coli. This training set
included known antibiotics, such as Cipro and penicillin, as well as many drugs that are
not antibiotics. These data we used to train a model to learn molecular features
associated with antibacterial activity. We then applied this model to a drug-repurposing
library consisting of several thousand molecules and asked the model to identify molecules
that are predicted to have antibacterial properties but don't look like existing
antibiotics. Interestingly, only one molecule in that library fit these criteria, and that
molecule turned out to be Halocin. Given that Halocin does not look like any existing
antibiotic, it would have been impossible for a human, including an antibiotic expert, to
identify Halocin in this manner. Imagine now what we could do with this technology against
SARS-CoV-2.And that's not all.

We're also using the tools of synthetic biology, tinkering with DNA and other cellular
machinery, to serve human purposes like combating COVID-19, and of note, we are working to
develop a protective mask that can also serve as a rapid diagnostic test. So how does that
work? Well, we recently showed that you can take the cellular machinery out of a living
cell and freeze-dry it along with RNA sensors onto paper in order to create low-cost
diagnostics for Ebola and Zika. The sensors are activated when they're rehydrated by a
patient sample that could consist of blood or saliva, for example. It turns out, this
technology is not limited to paper and can be applied to other materials, including cloth.
For the COVID-19 pandemic, we're designing RNA sensors to detect the virus and
freeze-drying these along with the needed cellular machinery into the fabric of a face
mask, where the simple act of breathing, along with the water vapor that comes with it,
can activate the test.

Thus, if a patient is infected with SARS-CoV-2, the mask will produce a fluorescent signal
that could be detected by a simple, inexpensive handheld device. In one or two hours, a
patient could thus be diagnosed safely, remotely and accurately. We're also using synthetic
biology to design a candidate vaccine for COVID-19. We are repurposing the BCG vaccine,
which had been used against TB for almost a century. It's a live attenuated vaccine, and
we're engineering it to express SARS-CoV-2 antigens, which should trigger the production
of protective antibodies by the immune system. Importantly, BCG is massively scalable and
has a safety profile that's among the best of any reported vaccine. With the tools of
synthetic biology and artificial intelligence, we can win the fight against this novel
coronavirus. This work is in its very early stages, but the promise is real. Science and
technology can give us an important advantage in the battle of human wits versus the genes
of superbugs, a battle we can win. Thank you.
