Flanked by two powerful European nations, the English Channel has long been one of the
world’s most important maritime passages. Yet for most of its history, the channel’s
rocky shores and stormy weather made crossing a dangerous prospect. Engineers of the
early 1800's proposed numerous plans for spanning the 33 kilometer gap. Their designs
included artificial islands linked by bridges, submerged tubes suspended from floating
platforms, and an underwater passage more than twice the length of any existing tunnel.
By the end of the century, this last proposal had captured European imagination. The
invention of the tunnel boring machine and the discovery of a stable layer of chalk marl
below the seabed made this fantastic tunnel more feasible. But the project’s most urgent
obstacles were ones no engineer could solve. At the time, Britons viewed their geographic
isolation as a strategic advantage, and fears about French invasion shut down plans for
the tunnel.

The rise of aerial warfare rendered these worries obsolete, but new economic concerns 
arose to replace them. Finally, 100 years after the initial excavation, the two countries
 reached an agreement— the tunnel would proceed with private funding. In 1985, a group 
of French and British companies invested the modern equivalent of 14 billion pounds,
making the tunnel the most expensive infrastructure project to date. The design called 
for three separate tunnels— one for trains to France, one for trains to England, and one
service tunnel between them. Alongside crossover chambers, emergency passages, and air
ducts, this amounted to over 200 kilometers of tunnels. In 1988, workers began excavating
 from both sides, planning to meet in the middle. Early surveys of the French coast 
revealed the site was full of fault lines. These small cracks let water seep into the
rock, so engineers had to develop waterproof boring machines.

The British anticipated drier conditions, and forged ahead with regular borers. But only
months into the work, water flooded in through undetected fissures. To drill in this wet
chalk, the British had to use grout to seal the cracks created in the borer’s wake, and
even work ahead of the main borer to reinforce the chalk about to be drilled. With these
obstacles behind them, both teams began drilling at full speed. Boring machines weighing
up to 1,300 tons drilled at nearly 3.5 meters per hour. As they dug, they installed
lining rings to stabilize the tunnel behind them, making way for support wagons 
following each machine. Even at top speed, work had to proceed carefully. The chalk layer
followed a winding path between unstable rock and clay, punctured by over 100 boring
holes made by previous surveyors. Furthermore, both teams had to constantly check their
coordinates to ensure they were on track to meet within 2 centimeters of each
other.

To maintain this delicate trajectory, the borers employed satellite positioning systems,
as well as paleontologists who used excavated fossils to confirm they were at the right
depth. During construction, the project employed over 13,000 people and cost the lives of
ten workers. But after two and a half years of tunneling, the two sides finally made
contact. British worker Graham Fagg emerged on the French side, becoming the first human
to cross the channel by land since the Ice Age. There was still work to be done— from
installing crossover chambers and pumping stations, to laying over a hundred miles of
tracks, cables, and sensors. But on May 6, 1994, an opening ceremony marked the tunnel’s
completion. Full public service began 16 months later, with trains for passengers and
rail shuttles for cars and trucks. Today, the Channel Tunnel services over 20 million
passengers a year, transporting riders across the channel in just 35 minutes.

Unfortunately, not everyone has the privilege of making this trip legally. Thousands of
refugees have tried to enter Britain through the tunnel in sometimes fatal attempts.
These tragedies have transformed the tunnel’s southern entrance into an ongoing site of
conflict. Hopefully, the structure’s history can serve as a reminder that humanity is at
their best when breaking down barriers.
