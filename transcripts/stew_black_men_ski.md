Has anyone ever been to Aspen, Colorado? It's not a joke yet; those aren't the jokes. Is
this thing off? I went to Aspen recently and stumbled into this song.♫ Black men go to
Aspen ♫♫ and rent colorful chalets. ♫♫ Giggle at the questions ♫♫ their mere presence
seems to raise. ♫♫ Get taken for men ♫♫ we don't resemble in the least. ♫"Are you ... ?"
"No."♫ It's a winter wonderland ♫♫ in the belly of the beast. ♫♫ And black men ski. ♫♫
Black men ski. ♫♫ Black men send back sushi ♫♫ with a scorned Yakuza's flair. ♫♫ We make
postmodern art ♫♫ with bacon grease ♫♫ and hot combed hair. ♫♫ We secretly play Beethoven
♫♫ inside our bassmobiles. ♫♫ We can tell you how cool looks ♫♫ but cannot show you how it
feels ♫♫ when black men ski. ♫ ♫ When black men ski. ♫♫ Black men now are students ♫♫ of
gay sensibility. ♫♫ We wear ironic T-shirts ♫♫ drenched in code unknown to thee. ♫♫ We get
baptized in Walden Pond ♫♫ amongst a searing mob ♫♫ because the cleansing blood of Jesus
♫♫ could not do a thorough job.

♫♫ Black men ski. ♫♫ Black men ski. ♫♫ Chinese guys can jump real high ♫♫ and Germans cook
soul food. ♫♫ White boys rap and hippies nap ♫♫ their dreads up to look rude. ♫♫ Jazz is
now suburban ♫♫ it's Marsalisly clean. ♫♫ And now we've got Viagra ♫♫ everyone's a sex
machine. ♫♫ So black men ski. ♫What else can we do?♫ Black men ski. ♫♫ Black men ski. ♫♫
Black men ski. ♫♫ Some kids I'll describe as friends ♫♫ say I am race-obsessed. ♫♫ The
luxury of your opinion ♫♫ shows that you are blessed. ♫♫ See, I have poems about sunsets
♫♫ flowers and the rain. ♫♫ I've read them to policemen ♫♫ but it was all in vain. ♫♫ So
black men ski. ♫♫ Black men ski ... ♫ elegantly.♫ Black men ski. ♫♫ Black men ski.
♫
