In 132 CE, Chinese polymath Zhang Heng presented the Han court with his latest invention.
This large vase, he claimed, could tell them whenever an earthquake occurred in their
kingdom– including the direction they should send aid. The court was somewhat skeptical,
especially when the device triggered on a seemingly quiet afternoon. But when messengers
came for help days later, their doubts turned to gratitude. Today, we no longer rely on
pots to identify seismic events, but earthquakes still offer a unique challenge to those
trying to track them. So why are earthquakes so hard to anticipate, and how could we get
better at predicting them? To answer that, we need to understand some theories behind how
earthquakes occur. Earth’s crust is made from several vast, jagged slabs of rock called
tectonic plates, each riding on a hot, partially molten layer of Earth’s mantle. This
causes the plates to spread very slowly, at anywhere from 1 to 20 centimeters per
year.

But these tiny movements are powerful enough to cause deep cracks in the interacting
plates. And in unstable zones, the intensifying pressure may ultimately trigger an
earthquake. It’s hard enough to monitor these miniscule movements, but the factors that
turn shifts into seismic events are far more varied. Different fault lines juxtapose 
different rocks– some of which are stronger–or weaker– under pressure. Diverse rocks also
react differently to friction and high temperatures. Some partially melt, and can release
lubricating fluids made of superheated minerals that reduce fault line friction. But some
are left dry, prone to dangerous build-ups of pressure. And all these faults are subject
to varying gravitational forces, as well as the currents of hot rocks moving throughout
Earth’s mantle. So which of these hidden variables should we be analyzing, and how do they
fit into our growing prediction toolkit? Because some of these forces occur at largely
constant rates, the behavior of the plates is somewhat cyclical.

Today, many of our most reliable clues come from long-term forecasting, related to when
and where earthquakes have previously occurred. At the scale of millennia, this allows us
to make predictions about when highly active faults, like the San Andreas, are overdue
for a massive earthquake. But due to the many variables involved, this method can only
predict very loose timeframes. To predict more imminent events, researchers have
investigated the vibrations Earth elicits before a quake. Geologists have long used
seismometers to track and map these tiny shifts in the earth’s crust. And today, most
smartphones are also capable of recording primary seismic waves. With a network of phones
around the globe, scientists could potentially crowdsource a rich, detailed warning
system that alerts people to incoming quakes. Unfortunately, phones might not be able to
provide the advance notice needed to enact safety protocols.

But such detailed readings would still be useful for prediction tools like NASA’s 
Quakesim software, which can use a rigorous blend of geological data to identify regions
at risk. However, recent studies indicate the most telling signs of a quake might be
invisible to all these sensors. In 2011, just before an earthquake struck the east coast
of Japan, nearby researchers recorded surprisingly high concentrations of the radioactive
isotope pair: radon and thoron. As stress builds up in the crust right before an
earthquake, microfractures allow these gases to escape to the surface. These scientists
think that if we built a vast network of radon-thoron detectors in earthquake-prone
areas, it could become a promising warning system– potentially predicting quakes a week
in advance. Of course, none of these technologies would be as helpful as simply looking
deep inside the earth itself.

With a deeper view we might be able to track and predict large-scale geological changes
in real time, possibly saving tens of thousands of lives a year. But for now, these
technologies can help us prepare and respond quickly to areas in need– without waiting
for directions from a vase.
