title: This simple test can help kids hear better
speaker: Susan Emmett
description: >-
 Children who live in rural areas can have a hard time getting to the doctor --
 much less to an audiologist's clinic for expensive, complex tests to check their
 hearing. The result for too many kids is hearing loss caused by ear infections
 and other curable or preventable problems. That's why ear surgeon and TED Fellow
 Susan Emmett is working with 15 communities in rural Alaska to create a simple,
 low-cost test that only requires a cell phone. Learn more about her work and how
 it could change the lives of children who don't have access to hearing care.

Listen to the sounds of why hearing matters to the Alaskan Native people. Hearing loss
makes it hard to fish on the open water, hunt caribou and harvest berries, activities
central to Alaskan Native culture. Hearing loss isn't unique to rural Alaska. It's global.
The Global Burden of Disease Project estimates there are 1.1 billion people living with
hearing loss worldwide. That's more people than the entire population here in sub-Saharan
Africa. Over 80 percent are in low- and middle-income countries, and many have no access
to hearing care. The impact on people's lives is tremendous. Anuk is a three-year-old boy I
treated in Alaska. Ear infections started when he was barely four months old. His parents
brought him into clinic, worried he didn't say much compared to his brothers. Sure enough,
many rounds of infections had resulted in hearing loss. Without treatment, Anuk's speech
will continue to lag behind.

He's more likely to do worse in school, have worse job prospects and experience social
isolation. But it doesn't have to be this way. The World Health Organization estimates that
half of all global hearing loss can be prevented. If Anuk's hearing loss is identified and
treated promptly, his life and the opportunities he has as he grows up could look vastly
different. I'm an ear surgeon working with partners around the world on new pathways for
hearing loss prevention. This solution comes from my collaboration with a tribal health
organization called the Norton Sound Health Corporation. Hearing loss evaluation
traditionally requires testing by an audiologist in a soundproof room, with a lot of
permanent equipment. An ear surgeon then examines Anuk's ears under a microscope and
decides a treatment plan. These resources simply aren't available in remote settings. In a
state where 75 percent of communities aren't connected to a hospital by road, an expensive
flight is required.

To overcome these barriers, Alaska has developed a state-of-the-art telemedicine system
that connects over 250 village health clinics with specialists who triage all types of
health concerns. My colleagues have validated that ear-related telemedicine consults are
equivalent to an in-person exam. In 2016, travel was prevented for 91 percent of patients
receiving specialty telemedicine in the Norton Sound region. Telemedicine has saved over
18 million in travel costs in this single region over the past 15 years. Our team is taking
the power of telemedicine to a new level, through a project funded by the Patient-Centered
Outcomes Research Institute. For the first time, we are merging telemedicine with mobile
screening technology that extends the reach of expert triage beyond health care settings.
This cell-based screen, developed in South Africa, costs over 10 times less than
traditional equipment and does not require advanced training.

If I were screening Anuk at school, sound-attenuating headphones and noise monitoring
would take the place of a sound booth, and I would use a phone adapter instead of a
microscope to examine his ears. In a matter of minutes, screening and images are done. We
then apply Alaska telemedicine technology to transmit the data to specialists, who connect
Anuk to the treatment he needs. Our team is launching a randomized trial in 15 communities
along the Bering Sea to study how well this intervention works. Our goal is to prevent
childhood hearing loss across the state of Alaska. But the concept is bigger than a single
state. The impact is global. Mobile telemedicine can revolutionize access to care. In
Malawi, for example, there are only two ear surgeons and 11 audiologists for a population
of 17 million. This technology could empower teachers and community health workers to
provide access to care to children in places like Malawi.

Scaling up globally could change children's lives who have never had access to hearing
care before, using just the power of a cell phone. It's time to change the course of
preventable hearing loss. Anuk and countless children like him are depending on us. Thank
you.
