title: Are Elvish, Klingon, Dothraki and Na'vi real languages?
speaker: John McWhorter
description: >-
 What do Game of Thrones' Dothraki, Avatar's Na'vi, Star Trek's Klingon and LOTR's
 Elvish have in common? They are all fantasy constructed languages, or conlangs.
 Conlangs have all the delicious complexities of real languages: a high volume of
 words, grammar rules, and room for messiness and evolution. John McWhorter
 explains why these invented languages captivate fans long past the rolling
 credits. [Directed by Joyce Stenneke, narrated by John McWhorter].

To many, one of the coolest things about "Game of Thrones" is that the inhabitants of the
Dothraki Sea have their own real language. And Dothraki came hot on the heels of the real
language that the Na'vi speak in "Avatar," which, surely, the Na'vi needed when the
Klingons in "Star Trek" have had their own whole language since 1979. And let's not forget
the Elvish languages in J.R.R. Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, especially since
that was the official grandfather of the fantasy conlangs. "Conlang" is short for
"constructed language." They're more than codes like Pig Latin, and they're not just
collections of fabricated slang like the Nadsat lingo that the teen hoodlums in "A
Clockwork Orange" speak, where "droog" from Russian happens to mean "friend." What makes
conlangs real languages isn't the number of words they have. It helps, of course, to have
a lot of words. Dothraki has thousands of words. Na'vi started with 1,500 words. Fans on
websites have steadily created more.

But we can see the difference between vocabulary alone and what makes a real language from
a look at how Tolkien put together grand old Elvish, a conlang with several thousands
words. After all, you could memorize 5,000 words of Russian and still be barely able to
construct a sentence. A four-year-old would talk rings around you. That's because you have
to know how to put the words together. That is, a real language has grammar. Elvish does.
In English, to make a verb past, you add an "-ed." Wash, washed. In Elvish, "wash" is
"allu" and "washed" is "allune." Real languages also change over time. There's no such
thing as a language that's the same today as it was a thousand years ago. As people speak,
they drift into new habits, shed old ones, make mistakes, and get creative. Today, one
says, "Give us today our daily bread." In Old English, they said, "Urne gedaeghwamlican
hlaf syle us todaeg." Things change in conlangs, too. Tolkien charted out ancient and
newer versions of Elvish.

When the first Elves awoke at Cuivi√©nen, in their new language, the word for "people" was
"kwendi," but in the language of one of the groups that moved away, Teleri, over time,
"kwendi" became "pendi," with the "k" turning into a "p." And just like real languages,
conlangs like Elvish split off into many. When the Romans transplanted Latin across
Europe, French, Spanish, and Italian were born. When groups move to different places, over
time, their ways of speaking grow apart, just like everything else about them. Thus,
Latin's word for hand was "manus," but in French, it became "main," while in Spain it
became "mano." Tolkien made sure Elvish did the same kind of thing. While that original
word "kwendi" became "pendi" among the Teleri, among the Avari, who spread throughout
Middle Earth, it became "kindi" when the "w" dropped out. The Elvish varieties Tolkien
fleshed out the most are Quenya and Sindarin, and their words are different in the same
way French and Spanish are.

Quenya has "suc" for "drink," Sindarin has "sog." And as you know, real languages are
messy. That's because they change, and change has a way of working against order, just
like in a living room or on a bookshelf. Real languages are never perfectly logical.
That's why Tolkien made sure that Elvish had plenty of exceptions. Lots of verbs are
conjugated in ways you just have to know. Take even the word "know." In the past, it's
"knew," which isn't explained by any of the rules in English. Oh well. In Elvish, "know"
is "ista," but "knew" is "sinte." Oh well. The truth is, though, that Elvish is more a
sketch for a real language than a whole one. For Tolkien, Elvish was a hobby rather than
an attempt to create something people could actually speak. Much of the Elvish the
characters in the "Lord of the Rings" movies speak has been made up since Tolkien by
dedicated fans of Elvish based on guesses as to what Tolkien would have
constructed.

That's the best we can do for Elvish because there are no actual Elves around to speak it
for us. But the modern conlangs go further. Dothraki, Na'vi, and Klingon are developed
enough that you can actually speak them. Here's a translation of "Hamlet" into Klingon,
although performing it would mean getting used to pronouncing "k" with your uvula, that
weird, cartoony thing hanging in the back of your throat. Believe it or not, you actually
do that in plenty of languages around the world, like Eskimo ones. Pronouncing Elvish is
much easier, though. So, let's take our leave for now from this introduction to conlangs
in Elvish and the other three conlangs discussed with a heartfelt quad-conlangual
valedictory: "A Na Marie!" "Hajas!" Na'vi's "Kiyevame!" "Qapla!" and "Goodbye!"
