title: What is déjà vu? What is déjà vu?
speaker: Michael Molina
description: >-
 You might have felt it -- the feeling that you've experienced something before,
 but, in reality, the experience is brand new. There are over 40 theories that
 attempt to explain the phenomenon of déjà vu. Michael Molina explains how
 neuroimaging and cognitive psychology have narrowed down the theories that could
 explain that feeling you're having...again. [Directed by Josh Harris, narrated by
 Michelle Snow].

Have you experienced déjà vu? It's that shadowy feeling you get when a situation seems
familiar. A scene in a restaurant plays out exactly as you remember. The world moves like
a ballet you've choreographed, but the sequence can't be based on a past experience
because you've never eaten here before. This is the first time you've had clams, so what's
going on? Unfortunately, there isn't one single explanation for déjà vu. The experience is
brief and occurs without notice, making it nearly impossible for scientists to record and
study it. Scientists can't simply sit around and wait for it to happen to them — this
could take years. It has no physical manifestations and in studies, it's described by the
subject as a sensation or feeling. Because of this lack of hard evidence, there's been a
surplus of speculation over the years. Since Emile Boirac introduced déjà vu as a French
term meaning "already seen," more than 40 theories attempt to explain this
phenomenon.

Still, recent advancements in neuroimaging and cognitive psychology narrow down the field
of prospects. Let's walk through three of today's more prevalent theories, using the same
restaurant setting for each. First up is dual processing. We'll need an action. Let's go
with a waiter dropping a tray of dishes. As the scene unfolds, your brain's hemispheres
process a flurry of information: the waiter's flailing arms, his cry for help, the smell
of pasta. Within milliseconds, this information zips through pathways and is processed
into a single moment. Most of the time, everything is recorded in-sync. However, this
theory asserts that déjà vu occurs when there's a slight delay in information from one of
these pathways. The difference in arrival times causes the brain to interpret the late
information as a separate event. When it plays over the already-recorded moment, it feels
as if it's happened before because, in a sense, it has.

Our next theory deals with a confusion of the past rather than a mistake in the present.
This is the hologram theory, and we'll use that tablecloth to examine it. As you scan its
squares, a distant memory swims up from deep within your brain. According to the theory,
this is because memories are stored in the form of holograms, and in holograms, you only
need one fragment to see the whole picture. Your brain has identified the tablecloth with
one from the past, maybe from your grandmother's house. However, instead of remembering
that you've seen it at your grandmother's, your brain has summoned up the old memory
without identifying it. This leaves you stuck with familiarity, but no recollection.
Although you've never been in this restaurant, you've seen that tablecloth but are just
failing to identify it. Now, look at this fork. Are you paying attention? Our last theory
is divided attention, and it states that déjà vu occurs when our brain subliminally takes
in an environment while we're distracted by one particular object.

When our attention returns, we feel as if we've been here before. For example, just now
you focused on the fork and didn't observe the tablecloth or the falling waiter. Although
your brain has been recording everything in your peripheral vision, it's been doing so
below conscious awareness. When you finally pull yourself away from the fork, you think
you've been here before because you have, you just weren't paying attention. While all
three of these theories share the common features of déjà vu, none of them propose to be
the conclusive source of the phenomenon. Still, while we wait for researchers and
inventers to come up with new ways to capture this fleeting moment, we can study the
moment ourselves. After all, most studies of déjà vu are based on first-hand accounts, so
why can't one be yours? The next time you get déjà vu, take a moment to think about it.
Have you been distracted? Is there a familiar object somewhere? Is your brain just acting
slow?

Or is it something else?
