Bien-Aimé Baraza: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's a pleasure and honor to be
here today. Onstage is the group called Sauti Sol.

We have a couple of people paid in the audience to make some noise for
us.

The four of us met in high school, 15 years ago, and at the time, we were famous for
singing Boyz II Men covers, because they were our biggest inspiration.

And I remember, in a very pervy way, in my room, I had a Mariah Carey poster and a Britney
Spears poster, too.

And I can't help but feel that times have changed. Because what used to be Mariah Carey in
my room now, in a 15-year-old boy's room, is Tiwa Savage. What used to be 50 Cent in my
room then, to a 15-year-old boy's room now is Sauti Sol.

The role of Afrobeats in emancipating and getting over the colonial mindset of the youth
cannot be ignored. Afrobeats has played the strongest role so far, if you ask me, as far
as emancipating the youth is concerned. We are now the superstars of our generation, for
our people. We are the solution to their musical problems.

And people our age are no longer looking for entertainment from America, from the West. We
are the entertainment, and they're priming us above any other form of art. In 2015,
President Obama came to Kenya, and we had the pleasure of being the entertainment for the
state dinner that happened at state house, Nairobi. And as we were performing, he jumped
onstage with us, and together, we did a cultural dance to a song that I want to share with
you guys right now. And wherever you are, if you feel the music, dance. Ladies and
gentleman, "Sura Yako."

Savara Mudigi: Wow. Thank you, thank you so much.

So, afrobeats, afrobeats. Afrobeat is a force, it's a force in the world right now. Just
last year, in the last year alone, Africa had songs in the Billboard charts. "One Dance,"
written by Wizkid, performed by Wizkid and Drake. "Unforgettable" by French Montana. For
those who know or don't know, French Montana is Moroccan. Artists who the world has
normally considered as mainstream are now realizing they're late to the party. And they
are knocking on the door, and because we are good people, we are going to let them
in.

When we look at an artist, Queen B herself — in brackets, Beyoncé —

Beyoncé has African influence in her music. A couple of years ago, in 2011, through
YouTube, she saw these dancers called Tofo Tofo dancers, from Mozambique, and she flew
them all the way from Mozambique to Los Angeles to teach her and her dancers the now
signature dance moves that you see in her song, "Run the World 

."Yeah. 

So, with social media and a vibrant, vibrant African diaspora, more and more the world is
dancing to our rhythm and talking our pidgin. Yeah? 

Thanks, Nigeria, we'll use that for across the board.

Our next song, "Kuliko Jana," had a viral video that was posted by Snoop Dogg, Ne-Yo,
Talib Kweli. And the general feedback of this song, especially in the black community in
the United States, was that this song gave them a feeling or a sense of spiritual
repatriation. So, ladies and gentlemen, "Kuliko Jana."
