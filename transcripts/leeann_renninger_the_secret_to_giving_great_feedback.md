If you look at a carpenter, they have a toolbox; a dentist, they have their drills. In our
era and the type of work most of us are doing, the tool we most need is actually centered
around being able to give and receive feedback well.[The Way We Work]Humans have been
talking about feedback for centuries. In fact, Confucius, way back in 500 BC, talked about
how important it is to be able to say difficult messages well. But to be honest, we're
still pretty bad at it. In fact, a recent Gallup survey found that only 26 percent of
employees strongly agree that the feedback they get actually improves their work. Those
numbers are pretty dismal. So what's going on? The way that most people give their feedback
actually isn't brain-friendly. People fall into one of two camps. Either they're of the
camp that is very indirect and soft and the brain doesn't even recognize that feedback is
being given or it's just simply confused, or they fall into the other camp of being too
direct, and with that, it tips the other person into the land of being defensive. There's
this part of the brain called the amygdala, and it's scanning at all times to figure out
whether the message has a social threat attached to it.

With that, we'll move forward to defensiveness, we'll move backwards in retreat, and what
happens is the feedback giver then starts to disregulate as well. They add more ums and
ahs and justifications, and the whole thing gets wonky really fast. It doesn't have to be
this way. I and my team have spent many years going into different companies and asking
who here is a great feedback giver. Anybody who's named again and again, we actually bring
into our labs to see what they're doing differently. And what we find is that there's a
four-part formula that you can use to say any difficult message well. OK, are you ready for
it? Here we go. The first part of the formula is what we call the micro-yes. Great
feedback givers begin their feedback by asking a question that is short but important. It
lets the brain know that feedback is actually coming. It would be something, for example,
like, "Do you have five minutes to talk about how that last conversation went" or "I have
some ideas for how we can improve things.

Can I share them with you?" This micro-yes question does two things for you. First of all,
it's going to be a pacing tool. It lets the other person know that feedback is about to be
given. And the second thing it does is it creates a moment of buy-in. I can say yes or no
to that yes or no question. And with that, I get a feeling of autonomy. The second part of
the feedback formula is going to be giving your data point. Here, you should name
specifically what you saw or heard, and cut out any words that aren't objective. There's a
concept we call blur words. A blur word is something that can mean different things to
different people. Blur words are not specific. So for example, if I say "You shouldn't be
so defensive" or "You could be more proactive." What we see great feedback givers doing
differently is they'll convert their blur words into actual data points. So for example,
instead of saying, "You aren't reliable," we would say, "You said you'd get that email to
me by 11, and I still don't have it yet." Specificity is also important when it comes to
positive feedback, and the reason for that is that we want to be able to specify exactly
what we want the other person to increase or diminish.

And if we stick with blur words, they actually won't have any clue particularly what to do
going forward to keep repeating that behavior. The third part of the feedback formula is
the impact statement. Here, you name exactly how that data point impacted you. So, for
example, I might say, "Because I didn't get the message, I was blocked on my work and
couldn't move forward" or "I really liked how you added those stories, because it helped
me grasp the concepts faster." It gives you a sense of purpose and meaning and logic
between the points, which is something the brain really craves. The fourth part of the
feedback formula is a question. Great feedback givers wrap their feedback message with a
question. They'll ask something like, "Well, how do you see it?" Or "This is what I'm
thinking we should do, but what are your thoughts on it?" What it does is it creates
commitment rather than just compliance.

It makes the conversation no longer be a monologue, but rather becomes a joint
problem-solving situation. But there's one last thing. Great feedback givers not only can
say messages well, but also, they ask for feedback regularly. In fact, our research on
perceived leadership shows that you shouldn't wait for feedback to be given to you — what
we call push feedback — but rather, you should actively ask for feedback, what we call
pulling feedback. Pulling feedback establishes you as a continual learner and puts the
power in your hands. The most challenging situations are actually the ones that call for
the most skillful feedback. But it doesn't have to be hard. Now that you know this
four-part formula, you can mix and match it to make it work for any difficult
conversation.
