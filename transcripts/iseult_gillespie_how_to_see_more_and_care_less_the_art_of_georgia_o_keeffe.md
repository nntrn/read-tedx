title: How to see more and care less: The art of Georgia O'Keeffe
speaker: Iseult Gillespie
description: >-
 Feeling disconnected from creating art within classical conventions, artist
 Georgia O'Keeffe began experimenting with abstract drawings that defied easy
 classification. Using the shapes and rhythms of nature to capture her internal
 world, these experiments became the cornerstone of the movement known as American
 Modernism. Iseult Gillespie explores the works of the elusive painter and
 sculptor. [Directed by Lisa LaBracio, narrated by Christina Greer, music by M.

A canvas drenched in sunset hues, colors radiating like flame. At first glance, this
painting may appear to be an impossible, abstract image. But a closer look reveals the
tender stems, lush petals and velvety texture of a Canna Lily. This metamorphosis of
natural subjects into abstract geometry is commonplace in the work of Georgia O’Keeffe—
the revolutionary American painter and sculptor. But the magic behind this
transformation remains just as elusive as the artist herself. Born in Wisconsin in 1887,
O’Keeffe spent her childhood plucking wildflowers and arranging fruits to paint. At
seventeen, she moved to Chicago to study at the prestigious Art Institute. Her teachers
trained her to faithfully reproduce reality in the conventions of European masters.
Although she enjoyed the solitude and precision of this work, O’Keeffe felt little 
personal connection to it. After moving to New York, she was increasingly drawn to the
clean lines, striking composition and vivid colors of Japanese art.

O’Keeffe soon found a teacher whose lessons inspired her to put those interests into
practice. Unlike her previous teachers, Arthur Wesley Dow urged his students to focus on
more abstract representations of light, shape, and color. These lessons manifested in
O’Keeffe’s first series of abstract drawings. Rendered in charcoal, they present a series
of undulating lines, bold shading and billowing clouds. These drawings defy easy
classification— suggesting, but never quite matching, any specific natural reference.
Earlier European painters in the Cubist tradition had employed rigid geometry to abstract
external subjects. But here, O’Keeffe employed the shapes and rhythms of nature to
capture her internal feelings. Experiments like these would soon become a cornerstone of
an artistic movement called American Modernism. Although no single style defines 
Modernist painting, its proponents shared a desire to challenge the realist traditions
that dominated art education.

Beginning in the late 1910’s, Modernist painting often used geometric shapes and bold
colors to probe the American psyche. O’Keeffe threw herself into these experiments — but
she was reluctant to share her new work. However, when a friend sent her charcoals to the
art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, he became entranced. In 1916, he arranged for a grand
exhibition in New York. This marked the beginning of O’Keeffe’s career as a popular
artist— and a relationship that would lead to marriage in 1924.Marriage didn’t diminish
O’Keeffe’s taste for solitude. She travelled widely to teach, and often retreated to paint
 for months at a time. Whether she was exploring the craggy canyons of Texas, the quiet
forests of South Carolina, or the sun-bleached desert of New Mexico, her creative process
was based on ritual and close observation. She paid meticulous attention to small
details, and spent hours mixing paints to create exactly the right colors.

When she found the perfect hue, she’d record it in her ever-growing collection of handmade
color cards. O’Keeffe also experimented with perspective to celebrate objects that were
often overlooked. In "Rams Head with Hollyhock," she places a weathered skull and a
delicate flower high above the hills below. This massive skull overshadows the landscape,
casting both the skeleton and the mountains in a new, eerie light. The public was
captivated by her unique perspective and secretive behavior. She was particularly praised
 for her massive flower paintings, ranging from fiery poppies to ghostly calla lillies.
Stieglitz and other critics of the time were infatuated by Freudian psychology, and were
quick to link these paintings to female genitalia. But O’Keeffe dismissed such
interpretations. She resented the male gaze that dominated the art world, and demanded
her work be respected for its emotional evocation of the natural world. Eventually,
O’Keeffe settled down in New Mexico, near one of her favorite artist retreats.

In her 70’s, her eyesight began to fail, but she continued to mine the landscape’s
mysteries in new, tactile mediums. O’Keeffe kept creating until her death at 98, and is
remembered as the “Mother of American Modernism.” Decades on, her work retains its wild
energy— and O’Keeffe her personal mystique.
