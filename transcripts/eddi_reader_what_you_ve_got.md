This song is one of Thomas' favorites, called "What You Do with What You've Got."♫ You
must know someone like him ♫♫ He was tall and strong and lean ♫♫ With a body like a
greyhound ♫♫ and a mind so sharp and keen ♫♫ But his heart, just like laurel ♫♫ grew
twisted around itself ♫♫ Till almost everything he did ♫♫ brought pain to someone else ♫♫
It's not just what you're born with ♫♫ It's what you choose to bear ♫♫ It's not how big
your share is ♫♫ It's how much you can share ♫♫ It's not the fights you dreamed of ♫♫ It's
those you really fought ♫♫ It's not what you've been given ♫♫ It's what you do with what
you've got ♫♫ What's the use of two strong legs ♫♫ if you only run away? ♫♫ And what's the
use of the finest voice ♫♫ if you've nothing good to say? ♫♫ What's the use of strength
and muscle ♫♫ if you only push and shove? ♫♫ And what's the use of two good ears ♫♫ if you
can't hear those you love? ♫♫ What's the use of two strong legs ♫♫ if you only run
away?

♫♫ And what's the use of the finest voice ♫♫ if you've nothing good to say? ♫♫ What's the
use of strength and muscle ♫♫ if you only push and shove? ♫♫ And what's the use of two
good ears ♫♫ if you can't hear those you love? ♫♫ Between those who use their neighbors ♫♫
and those who use the cane ♫♫ Between those in constant power ♫♫ and those in constant
pain ♫♫ Between those who run to glory ♫♫ and those who cannot run ♫♫ Tell me which ones
are the cripples ♫♫ and which ones touch the sun ♫♫ Which ones touch the sun ♫♫ Which ones
touch the sun ♫

Thank you very much.
